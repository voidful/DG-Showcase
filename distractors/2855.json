{"id": "2855", "article": "My husband can plan wonderful surprise celebrations for me . Recently , however , I told him I did n ' t want him to plan one for my upcoming birthday . \" Why ? \" he asked . \" I am embarrassed being the center of attention , \" I quickly explained . Later , I began to think more deeply about this reason . Then I remembered the surprise celebration I had planned for my friend Nancy on her 60th birthday . We were roommates on a threeweek tour following the Silk Road on those famous steppes - - and through the mountains - - of central Asia . That afternoon we had arrived at our hotel in Samarkand , Uzbekistan . The young man at the hotel desk told me about a bakery about 10 minutes away . After giving me detailed directions , he added , \" Your nose will let you know when you arrive there . \" The temperature was 40 degC . Soon , _ proved to be an unfailing guide . Outside the bakery , a delicious smell greeted me . There were several kinds of breads , cookies , and cakes on display . There were also beautiful iced cakes . I chose a cake topped with powdered sugar . Later at the Karim Bek Restaurant , Nancy did n ' t see the young waiter walk up the steps with the cake . When I began singing \" Happy Birthday , \" everyone at our table - - except Nancy - - joined in . It took her a moment to realize what was happening . Then the grinning guest of honor thanked me , blew out the candles on the cake , and ate three pieces of it . Today , after reliving this experience in my mind , I told my husband to ignore my request . I now understand what a surprise party is about : It is not about having a surprise party but rather the delight in giving it . That is what brings the satisfying joy .", "questions": "Why did the author go to the bakery ?", "options": {"model": ["to buy a birthday cake for her friend .", "to eat three pieces of cakes ."], "human": ["To eat some iced cakes to cool herself down .", "To buy a birthday cake for her friend ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
