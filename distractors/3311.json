From that moment , he never stopped searching for clues which might lead him to the island . He read hundreds of adventure books , histories , volumes of physics and chemistry , even music . Over time , he pieced together his idea of what the Island of Inventions was like . It was a secret place , where all the great wise men of the world would meet to learn and invent together . Access to the island was totally restricted . To join , you had to have created some great invention for humanity . Only then could you receive the special invitation - - which came with directions to the island . So Luca spent his youth studying and inventing . Every new idea he got , he made it into an invention , and if there were something he did n ' t understand , he ' d seek others to help him . Soon he met other young inventors and he told them about the Island of Inventions . They too dreamed of one day receiving an invitation letter . As years passed , the disappointment of not receiving their invitation made Luca and his friends work harder and co - operate more . They would meet in Luca ' s house , share their ideas and build new machines . Their inventions became known throughout the world , and improved the lives of millions . But still , no invitation came . They did n ' t lose heart . They continued learning and inventing every day , trying to come up with more and better ideas .
