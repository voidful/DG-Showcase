The reunion was brought about by Teresa Micco , a Southern California veterinarian who mistook Nigel , an African gray parrot , for her own missing bird , the Daily Breeze reported on Sunday . Teresa Micco tracked Nigel ' s microchip to Darren Chick , a British man who lives in Torrance , California . \" I introduced myself and said , ' Have you lost a bird ? ' \" Micco told the newspaper . \" He first said , ' No ' But he thought I meant recently \" When she checked on Chick ' s name and said she had his African gray parrot , \" He looked at me like I was crazy . \" He said his bird had gone missing for four years earlier . Little is known about Nigel ' s whereabouts for the past four years , but Chick says the bird ' s British accent is gone , and it now chatters in Spanish . Chick says last week ' s reunion brought tears of joy to his eyes - - - despite the fact that Nigel bit him when he first tried to pick him up . Micco said the behaviour was not unusual and that Nigel would settle back in soon enough . \" He is doing very well , \" Chick told the newspaper . \" It is really strange . I knew it was him from the minute I saw him \" It is the fifth parrot reunion helped by Micco , who has been running advertisements for her own missing bird for nine months . That parrot , Benjamin , escaped in February when it flew out through a door that had been left open . Julissa Sperling found Nigel outside her home and brought him to Micco after seeing one of her advertisements . \" He was the happiest bird . He was singing and talking all the time , \" Sperling said . \" He was barking like my dogs . I am from Panama , and he was saying , ' What happened ? ' in Spanish . \"", "questions": "What is the main idea of the text ?", "options": {"model": ["a new parrot lost its owner .", "a parrot missing for years returns speaking spanish", "a parrot ' s owner is missing for years", "a parrot ' s owner lost his way"], "human": ["A man finds that his bird can speak Spanish", "Teresa Micco helps many people find their missing pets", "Kindness and love are passed on through a parrot .", "A parrot missing for years returns speaking Spanish"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
