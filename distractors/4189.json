Liangliang called the police to take his mother away - - such a \" good reason \" to call the police . Most people would just laugh it off . However , it shows that something is wrong with our education . It rings alarm to our Chinese parents to think about it . Parents should ask themselves why they ' re so angry when their kids want to watch cartoons instead of doing homework . Kids are supposed to be simple and naughty . They can just ask their kids to do things they expect them to do . Schoolwork is important but a healthy childhood is much more important .

It ' s also a good way to help parents themselves to grow , too . In China , lots of parents care more about scores than any other things . They hope their kids can be top students and go to the top colleges . Curriculum Reformation is coming though , and it would bring some changes to our schools . It ' s also time for parents to change their minds to reduce pressure on their kids and help them to grow happily and naturally .", "questions": "Parents can reduce pressure on their kids by", "options": {"model": ["helping their kids grow", "changing their own minds", "making their kids grow healthily"], "human": ["helping the kids go to the top colleges", "helping the kids to be top students", "changing their own minds"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
