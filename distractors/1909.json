{"id": "1909", "article": "The Loss of Innocence Innocence is such a precious gift . It ' s explained as freedom from guilt or wrong doing . Just imagine never having to worry about anything and having a guilt - free mind . Some people wish to save this kind of innocence from being lost from childhood to adulthood . What would the world be like if innocence were never lost ? One way it would benefit humanity is the lack of hatred among the world . During youth , there may be an occasional argument , even a little physical fight , but nothing like firing a handgun at a fellow human being . And children are blind towards the racial differences of others . A kid will hang out with any other kid . It is the lack of innocence and the ignorance we learn from adults that influence children otherwise . Another benefit is the constant desire for fun and adventure . With very little if any time at all for fun , the adventurous mind is lost in time with the responsibilities placed upon adults . If innocence were kept alive , these ambitions would never depart from our lives . However , other people actually hate the idea of innocence lasting for ever . They feel that the lack of organization and mental power of those with innocence would cause extremely destructive consequences to society in general . A large number of individuals would never have the urge to learn , work , and act upon the necessary needs for humanity to survive . Without a proper education which is usually provided by those who no longer live in a world of innocence , people would not have the desire to succeed , get a good job in life , or provide income for their families , which would hurt the lives of children . The lack of a good education and career would also harm the economy . As long as innocence is kept alive , no one would be terribly angry at the lack of effort people put out in the workplace , resulting in a strong decline in production and quality of needed goods . Maybe it is wrong in wanting to save innocence . It sure is a nice thought , though . Perhaps innocence was meant to be lost . It was god ' s will to make things the way they are , and there is a good purpose for everything . All that remains to be said about innocence is to enjoy it while it lasts .", "questions": "Lifelong innocence would be beneficial to society in that", "options": {"model": ["there would be no racial discrimination", "people would be less likely to commit punishment", "people would be less likely to succeed in the future"], "human": ["proper education would be provided", "people would realize their childhood dreams", "there would be no racial discrimination"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
