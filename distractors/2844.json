{"id": "2844", "article": "Health officials issued a waring over common energy - saving lghtbulbs after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer . A study by the Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) found that some eco - friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation that are above recognized safety limits . The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco - friendly bulbs . The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods , such as jewellery makers , and others who might have lights close to their faces , such as car mechanics . John O ' Hagan , a scientist at the HPA ' s centre for radiation , chemical and environmental dangers , began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them . Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus , which makes people highly sensitive to light . The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation , measured 2 cm from the lightbulbs , were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer . The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn , but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this , again similar to that of sunburn . The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes . People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out . It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs .", "questions": "In order not to be harmed by the UV radiation from some lightbulbs , people should", "options": {"model": ["avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work", "stop using open lightbers", "stop using open lightbobs", "stop using open lightbalbs"], "human": ["stop using eco - friendly lightbulbs at home", "take care not to expose their skin to direct sunlight", "urge the government to ban the use of lightbulbs", "avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
