Pirates have gone farther south and east in answer to increased patrols by warships off the Somali shore . The robbing of the three ships Sunday was about 600 miles outside the normal operation area for the international force , said a spokesman . The spokesman said the attack so far out at sea was a clear sign that the international patrols against pirates were having a \" marked effect on pirate activity in the area \" . \" Once they start attacking that far out , you ' re not even really talking about the Somali basin or areas of water that have any connection with Somalia , \" said an officer , Roger Middleton . \" Once you ' re that far out , it ' s just the Indian Ocean , and it means you ' re looking at trade going from the Gulf to Asia , from Asia to South Africa . \" \" This is the farthest robbing to date . They are now operating near the Maldives and India , \" said another officer . The three ships - - the MV Prantalay 11 , 12 , and l 4 - - had 77 members on board in total . All of them are Thai , the spokesman said . Before the Sunday robbing , pirates held l l ships and 228 sailors .
