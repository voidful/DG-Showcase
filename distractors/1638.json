{"id": "1638", "article": "Your brain is n ' t a muscle , but you can treat it like one Many people focus on physical fitness , but few know that brain fitness is also something you can work on . In fact , you can exercise your brain as often as you do to your arms or legs - and the results can be positive and empowering . To improve your brain , you ca n ' t simply repeat the same exercises over and over . Just as lifting a two - pound weight will stop challenging you , so will repetitive exercises such as crosswords or Sudoku . Once you master easy exercises , you must move on to harder ones in order to push your brain - like your muscles - to a new level . The science behind brain training Scientists once believed that your mental abilities were fixed in adulthood . Since studies have shown just the opposite , millions of people around the world have adopted the new practice of brain training . The most popular of these brain training products is made by the San Francisco - based Lumosity . Lumosity ' s scientists with an experienced team of game designers have developed a fun , effective online brain training program that measures , tracks , and adapts to your progress , so you ' ll always be challenged . Promising studies on the effects of brain training In a 2013 Stanford study , a treatment group of 21 breast cancer survivors used 12 weeks of Lumosity training to work on processing speed , mental flexibility , and working memory tasks . On average , those who trained improved on tests of these abilities , compared to a group that did not train with Lumosity . There is even some evidence suggesting that Lumosity may be beneficial to normal , healthy adults . In a 2011 study by Lumosity and San Francisco State University researchers . 13 people who trained over 5 weeks improved working memory scores by 10 % and attention scores by 20 % . Brain training is designed to meet real - life needs The design of brain train ing is targeted at real - life benefits instead of improving game scores . Better attention , for example , can mean greater focus in the classroom or at an important business meeting . With improved processing speed , you might react and adapt faster to the demands of a busy life . And a better memory could mean stronger , longer relationships with the people closest", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["lumoity is a good way to exercise your brain", "lumosity training can help you improve your brain", "lumosity can measure , track and suit your level as you improve", "the more exercise you do , the healthier your brain is"], "human": ["brain training speeds up the recovery of breast cancer", "your brain is like a muscle because it gives you power", "people ' s mental abilities ca n ' t develop after they grow up", "Lumosity can measure , track and suit your level as you improve"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
