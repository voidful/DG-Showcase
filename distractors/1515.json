{"id": "1515", "article": "It had been a long time since I had been to Jacksonville , Florida . I had driven to town hoping to see the old barber shop where my hair had been cut as a child . I parked my truck and decided to try and locate a telephone to see if the Florida Barber College had moved to a new location . After walking about a block I saw an open shoe store . I walked inside and asked if I could use their telephone book . Unable to find a listing for the Barber College , I picked out the number of a local beauty salon , hoping they might tell me if the barber college was still in business . The number was busy , so I decided to wait and try again in a few minutes . As the salesman and I stood talking the front door opened and a young man about twenty came into the store pushing himself in a wheelchair . \" I need a new pair of shoes , \" said the customer . As he turned the corner , there was a blanket across his lap . I was shocked to see that the young man had no legs . \" A gift for a friend ? \" I asked the boy . \" No , \" he replied . They are for me , \" he continued , with a smile on his face . I just smiled back and watched to see what would happen next . \" What type of shoe would you like ? \" asked the clerk . \" How about a pair of cowboy boots ? \" The man pointed to the back wall where three or four pairs of boots were displayed . The salesman , sharply turning , headed off to the backroom . \" Is n ' t this fun ? \" the boy asked me . I moved my hand to let him know that I did not understand his question . \" When I was a kid , my parents used to buy me a new pair of shoes every year . That was such a wonderful feeling . Something I have never forgotten . The smell of the leather and the pride I felt when I walked around the store showing off my new shoes . \" The salesman came walking down the aisle with a large box . He sat it down on the floor , took out one boot and handed it to the young man . The boy closed his eyes . He placed the boot against his nose , and drew in a large breath . I did not know what to say as tears began to fall on the young man ' s cheeks . \" What type", "questions": "What can you conclude from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the author ' s parents used to buy him a new pair of shoes .", "the young man liked to buy shoes .", "the author was a man of understanding ."], "human": ["The young man was a stubborn person .", "The cowboy boots were fashionable then .", "The author was a man of understanding ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
