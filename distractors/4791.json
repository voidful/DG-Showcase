The Sports Center is on your left . You ca n ' t miss it . The basketball game starts at 1 : 00 p . m . so do n ' t be late . By the way , let ' s have some ice - cream after you finish playing . We can meet at Choco ' s Ice - Cream Shop . It ' s right around the corner from the Sports Center . Your game should be over at 3 : 00 p . m . so I ' ll meet you there 10 minutes later . Have fun !
