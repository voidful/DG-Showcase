They exchange newspapers and stamps . The school teachers discuss teaching methods with the teachers in the twin town . Officials visit the twin town for celebrations .

A few months later , their British friends come to study in Germany . Many British towns are so pleased with the results of the twinning that they set out to find more than one twin town !
