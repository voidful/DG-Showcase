{"id": "3135", "article": "It was an extremely hot day . My younger brother Walt and I had decided to go swimming in the stream behind Mr Blickez ' s house , because it would be the only way to cool ourselves down . Across his farm and through some woods was a deep swimming hole supplied by several cold springs . The only problem with our plan was that this farm was guarded by a huge mean Hereford bull . Mr Blickez had told us that Elsie , the animal ' s name , was the meanest bull in town , maybe even the county , and we believed in him . But the hotter it got , the more we thought there was reason to doubt about what he said . For one thing , we remembered Mr Blickez liked telling tall tales ; for another , Elsie seemed like a strange name for a bull . Finally , I talked Mom into asking permission for us to walk through the farm , and Mr Blickez finally agreed . On our way across the farm , we stopped at the fence to admire the swimming hole . The sun shone brightly across the cool waters . We could n ' t wait to get there . Suddenly , Walt shouted loudly . Elsie had run to him and was licking his back . I immediately hid under the fence . However , when I looked up , I saw that Elsie was n ' t a big mean bull at all . She was just a friendly young cow , and she was going to keep licking my brother ' s back as long as he stood still . When we discovered the truth , we were so happy . We then ran to the swimming hole and jumped in . The water was just as wonderful as we had dreamed . After that day , we had many good days and we often visited our secret swimming hole guarded by the so - called \" big mean bull \" .", "questions": "The author and his brother decided to go to swim because", "options": {"model": ["the weather was so hot that they could n ' t stand it", "they could n ' t go swimming in the river behind mr blickez ' s house", "they could n ' t stand the hot water"], "human": ["Mr Blickez invited them to his house for swimming", "they wanted to try their newly - found swimming hole", "the weather was so hot that they could n ' t stand it"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
