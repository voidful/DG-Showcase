{"id": "1865", "article": "In many ways , the earliest periods of photography are the most satisfying . Learning to use the controls is easy and comes quickly , and you can measure the results in terms of sharp and correctly developed pictures . Once you have mastered that , you can start on the second step of your photographic work . Using these basic skills in a wide variety of situations to give the pictures you want , noticing what you see through the viewfinder and turning that into the most effective picture becomes totally interesting . All good photographs have one thing in common ; there is no doubt what the subject of the picture is meant to be . Every photographer must use those same standards to his or her work , not only to the finished results but to the subject before he or she takes it . Always work out quite clearly what the subject of the picture is to be and why you are taking the picture . For example , \" I am going to take a picture of this street to show the different styles and ages of the buildings and that people have been living , working and shopping in them since time began . \" By doing this you have a better idea of what to include in the picture and what to leave out . How often have you been shown photographs taken by people away on a trip somewhere ? The judgment is always similar , something about \" the car park is out of the picture to the left \" , or \" you ca n ' t quite see from this picture but if you go up the street \" . The photographs are usually collections of buildings , people , parked cars , possibly a distant look of an ancient church , and best of all , a figure which you are told is Aunt Henrietta , disappearing in the middle distance . When photographers show you their pictures , they have a clear idea of what they want to bring to your attention , but it often does not appear in the picture . If they had given just a little of their time to think about their future judgment before taking the picture , then the picture would relate its own story . Good pictures can show their subjects quickly and easily .", "questions": "What book is this passage most likely taken from ?", "options": {"model": ["a book on developing a picture .", "a book on improving photographic techniques ."], "human": ["A book on how to photograph people", "A book on improving photographic techniques ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
