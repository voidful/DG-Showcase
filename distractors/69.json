{"id": "69", "article": "Which is safer - - - staying at home , traveling to work on public transport , or working at the office ? Surprisingly , each of these carries the same risk , which is very low . However , what about flying compared to working in the chemical industry ? Unfortunately , the former is 65 times riskier than the latter ! In fact the accident rate of workers in the chemical industry is less than that of almost any of human activity , and almost as safe as staying at home . The trouble with the chemical industry is that when things go wrong they often cause death to those living nearby . It is this that makes chemical accidents so newsworthy . Fortunately , they are extremely rare . The most famous ones happened at Texas City ( 1947 ) , Flixborough ( 1974 ) , Seveso ( 1976 ) , Pemex ( 1984 ) and Bhopal ( 1984 ) . Some of these are always in the minds of the people even though the loss of life was small . No one died at Seveso , and only 28 workers at Flixborough . The worst accident of all was Bhopal , where up to 3 , 000 were killed . The Texas City explosion of fertilizer killed 552 . The Pemex fire at a storage plant for natural gas in the suburbs of Mexico City took 542 lives , just a month before the unfortunate event at Bhopal . Some experts have discussed these accidents and used each accident to illustrate a particular danger . Thus the Texas City was caused by tons of ammonium nitrate , which is safe unless stored in a great quantity . The Flixborough fireball was the fault of management , which took risks to keep production going during essential repairs . The Seveso accident shows what happens if the local authorities lack knowledge of the danger on their doorstep . When the poisonous gas drifted over the town , local leaders were incapable of taking effective action . The Pemex fire was made worse by an overloaded site in an overcrowded suburb . The fire set off a chain reaction of exploding storage tanks . Yet , by a miracle , the two largest tanks did not explode . Had these caught fire , then 3 , 000 strong rescue team and fire fighters would all have died .", "questions": "According to the passage , the chemical accident that caused by the fault of management happened in", "options": {"model": ["the texas city explosion of fertilizer", "flixborough", "the texas city"], "human": ["Texas city", "Mexico City", "Flixborough"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
