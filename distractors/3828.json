{"id": "3828", "article": "Anchors on China Central Television ( CCTV ) will need to do some fast talking to replace the popular English acronyms they are now banned from using . Shanghai Dailyreports that \" anchors at China Central Television have been banned from saying the English acronyms NBA , CBA , GDP , and the like in their programs . \" The replacement for those handy acronyms ? Chinese presenters must use the full Chinese name , standardized by the State Administration of Radio , Film and Television . Although CCTV ( oops , we mean China Central Television ) presenters must already have a score of at least 94 in their government - rated oral mandarin proficiency exam , saying the full name of organizations like the CBA and WTO - - - 10 and 6 characters ' long respectively - - - is sure to challenge even the most skillful anchors . CCTV sports anchor Sun Zhengping tells Shanghai Daily , \" A full Chinese explanation of the English initials must be followed if my tongue slips . It is a little troublesome but a necessary one because not every member of the audience can understand the initials . \" Although the government is n ' t giving any official explanation for the shift , it is believed to have something to do with a proposal by Huang Youyi , director of the China International Publishing Group , at March ' s NPC meeting . In his speech , Huang said , \" With more and more publications mixing Chinese with English , measures and regulations should be adopted to avoid English invading Chinese . If we do n ' t pay attention and do n ' t take measures to stop the expansion of mixing Chinese with English , Chinese wo n ' t be a pure language in a couple of years . \" Although China is far from the first country to take measures to protect local languages , acronyms are more about saving time than they are about corrupting a language , we would think . Good luck to the CCTV anchors .", "questions": "CCTV anchors have to \" do some fast talking \" because they can no longer", "options": {"model": ["mix english into chinese", "be a pure language"], "human": ["use shortened Chinese expressions", "mix English into Chinese"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
