{"id": "1489", "article": "Who would have thought that potato fries could unite an entire country ? Well , that seems to be the case in Belgium where there is currently a movement to have Belgian potato fries officially recognized as cultural heritage . The fries are served in a paper cone from a \" fritkot \" , which is a shack or a food truck . Across Belgium , there are at least 5 , 000 fritkots which is 10 times more common than McDonald ' s restaurants in the United States . The movement for the fries to be declared official cultural heritage was started by UNAFRI , also known as the national association of fritkot owners . They claim that their establishments represent Belgium very well . \" A cone of potato chips is Belgium in miniature . What ' s amazing is that this way of thinking is the same , in spite of differences among communities and regions , \" added spokesman Bernard Lefevre . Tourists can even be seen to line up with locals in Brussels to buy a cone of fries from wellknown fritkots such as Frit Flagey and Maison Antoine . \" Before I came here , the only thing I knew about Belgium [ Z - x - x - k . Com ] was that they liked their fries , \" said Rachael Webb , a tourist from Ottowa , Canada . In order to be recognized by UNESCO , it has to be formally supported by the Belgian government of culture . As of right now , UNESCO has a list of 314 items of \" cultural heritage \" that they say is worthy enough to be preserved . Items on the list include Turkish coffee and the old native singing of the Central African Republic . Potatoes reached Belgium in the 16th century , but it was n ' t until the 19th century that they were cut up into fries and sold as a meal .", "questions": "The movement to have potato fries declared cultural heritage was started by", "options": {"model": ["a belgian industry", "an international association of fritthem"], "human": ["a Belgian cultural association", "a Belgian industry"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
