Lesson 1 : Ways of creative thinking are needed Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg both dropped out of college . They prefer to teach themselves because they like to develop their own ways of thinking . They think standard ways of teaching might stop people from being creative and having new ideas . Lesson 2 : The answer might not be what you expect Find your answers from facts - - not start with an expectation of what you will find . Stephen Jacobsen from Northwestern University believed what he was taught : that water on Earth came from icy comets or planets which hit into Earth . However , by studying a special rock , he discovered that it acts like a sponge . This suggests that Earth ' s water may have come from inside , driven to the surface to form the oceans , by geological activity . \" I had a pretty hard time making others believe it , \" he said . \" But thinking about the fact that you may the first person to see something for the first time does n ' t happen very often . When it does , it ' s amazing . \" _ Years of planning went into a recent achievement in space travel . The European Space Agency ' s \" Philae \" , a robot landing craft , met up with Comet 67P , which is 480 million kilometers away . The trip from Earth by \" Philae \" had taken ten years ! The scientists had no idea what the surface of the comet would be like . If the landing failed , it would be impossible to get information from the spacecraft . Twenty years of work would have been wasted . When \" Philae \" tried to land , it bounced away from the comet ' s icy surface twice . Luckily , however , \" Philae \" landed successfully and began sending information back to Earth .", "questions": "The example \" Philae \" in Lesson 3 shows that", "options": {"model": ["\" what happened on earth \" has never happened before", "\" what happened on earth \" was a real one", "\" philadi \" landed on the comet", "\" philae \" landed on comet 67p with a little luck"], "human": ["Comet 67P is not far away from Earth", "it took \" Philae \" 20 years to reach Comet 67P", "scientists know nothing about the surface of Comet 67P", "\" Philae \" landed on Comet 67P with a little luck"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
