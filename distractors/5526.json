{"id": "5526", "article": "Long after the 1998 World Cup was won , disappointed fans were still cursing the disputed refereeing decisions that denied victory to their team . A researcher was appointed to study the performance of some top referees . The researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams . Each match lasted an hour , divided into three periods of 20 minutes during which different referees were in charge . Observers noted down the referees ' errors , of which there were 61 over the tournament . Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes , each referee made almost 23 mistakes , a remarkably high number . The researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail . Surprisingly , he found that errors were more likely when the referees were close to the incident . When the officials got it right , they were , on average , 17 meters away from the action . The average distance in the case of errors was 12 meters . The research shows the optimum distance is about 20 meters . There also seemed to be an optimum speed . Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second . The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second . If FIFA , football ' s international ruling body , wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup , it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance , rather than rushing to keep up with the ball , the researcher argues . He also says that FIFA ' s insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided . If keeping up with the action is not so important , their physical condition is less critical .", "questions": "What is one of the possible conclusions of the experiment ?", "options": {"model": ["football players should not be allowed to be allowed to play football .", "it is important to keep your eyes on the action from a distance .", "age should not be the chief consideration in choosing a football referee .", "a basketball player must be a player of the match ."], "human": ["The ideal retirement age for an experienced football referee is 45 .", "A football referee should be as young and energetic as possible .", "An experienced football referee can do well even when in poor physical condition .", "Age should not be the chief consideration in choosing a football referee ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
