{"id": "2176", "article": "What are American high schools like ? Well , I ' m happy to tell you what I know . When I started school here , it had already been a week since the school opened . At this school , freshmen usually go on a trip for about three days at the beginning of school . Unfortunately I missed that wonderful trip , which would have been the best time to get to know my classmates . I was really sad . I wished I ' d known about it earlier . Despite the disappointment , however , I gradually adapted to my new life and school . There is a space in the basement of the teaching building where students chat and meet each other . As we do not always have the same classrooms and classmates , the school wants us to get to know each other there . Students usually come to school early , sit in that space and have fun . Around the space , there are many lockers for students to leave their books in , so that students do not have to carry a heavy schoolbag everywhere . It really surprises me that we have almost no textbooks . We only have textbooks for World History and Algebra 2 and they are big and heavy , like bricks . For other classes , we only need binders with paper in them . Without textbooks , students learn things freely and actively . For example , my humanities teacher just teaches us what is in her mind at the time . We never know what we will learn . Another difference between American schools and Chinese schools is that American schools care about students ' morality more than their academic studies . For example , if you do not finish your homework , you will just be asked to do it later , but if you cheat or lie , you will get a warning or even be kicked out . I think that most students here are good at schoolwork as well , but compared to Chinese students , they can make learning a more joyful experience . I think we should take the good points from our two different kinds of education to perfect our approach to studying .", "questions": "According to the passage , in American high schools ,", "options": {"model": ["students do not have to carry a heavy schoolbag every day", "you are likely to be kicked out if you cheat", "the student may be asked to do the homework later"], "human": ["students are better at school work than Chinese students", "students care much about the grades they get", "you are likely to be kicked out if you cheat"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
