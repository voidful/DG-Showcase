Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cargo was destroyed in the Oct . 28 explosion due to An \" equipment failure \" , said Orbital Sciences , the company hired by NASA for the resupply mission . The rocket was carrying a cargo ship loaded with 2 , 200 kilograms of supplies such as food , tools , parts , and experiments . Roughly a third of the cargo was a series of scientific investigations . Some of them were from high school students in the US . For example , 10 students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory School of Houston were conducting experiments about microgravity and put their samples on the rocket . \" I know that failure is a part of science , but I really feel sorry for my students , \" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston , Chronicle . Astronauts at the ISS felt a more urgent disappointment , however . The cargo included 617 kg of food . Now they will have to rely on supplies from a Russian launch on Oct . 29 . Launched in 1998 and involving the US , Russia , Canada , Japan , and the member countries of the European Space Agency , the ISS is one of the most ambitious international collaborations in history . Currently , there are six astronauts at the station , five male and one female . Three are from Russia , two are from the US , and one is from Germany . They have lived together for about six months . The station gets regular resupplies from Earth , using unmanned spacecrafts . Food is always a big part of the supplies . Most of the food is frozen and ready to eat , and often tastes bad - somewhat like trying to eat when you have a heavy cold . To make space life better , however , scientists have made breakthroughs . Earlier this year , Russian astronauts managed to grow a variety of crops aboard the station . Next year they are going to try to grow rice and other plants . And , as transporting water to space is expensive , astronauts are", "questions": "What is the author - s main purpose in writing the article ?", "options": {"model": ["to encourage us to eat more unmanned food and food for astronauts .", "to inform us of the explosion of nasa - s unmanned rocket and its effects .", "to encourage us to eat more unmanned food .", "to tell us about the development of space - resupply mission ."], "human": ["To explain what caused the explosion of NASA - s unmanned rocket .", "To tell us about astronauts lives at the International Space Station .", "To tell us how the world reacted to the explosion of NASA - s unmanned rocket .", "To inform us of the explosion of NASA - s unmanned rocket and its effects ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
