A studyhas shown that people tend to believe that organic foods contain fewer calories , so buy and eat more . But people who decide to \" go organic \" could soon find themselves piling on the pounds . The warning comes from American researchers who studied whether the sight of an organic label was enough to influence a person ' s choice . For example , if people believe organic foods , produced without using pesticides and artificial fertilizers , have fewer calories , they may end up eating far too much and spending less time on sports activities and put on weight . Cornell University researchers said : \" Some people mistakenly think that these foods are more nutritious , just because they carry an organic label . \" \" The growing popularity of organic foods has led to some concern , as these foods may not necessarily be healthier than non - organic ones , but still may lead consumers to nutritional mis - judgments . If people feel a food to be more nutritious , they tend to let their guard down when it comes to counting calories - - - in the end leading them to overeat . \" Although a small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically - produced crops and traditionally - produced ones , these are of little health importance . It shows that there is no proof to support the choice of organically over traditionally - produced foods because of nutritional advantage .", "questions": "What is the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["organic foods : cheap or better", "the import of organic food", "the importance of differences from organic foods", "health warning : organic foods could make you fat"], "human": ["Health Finding : Organic Foods Will Replace Traditional Foods", "Health Reminder : Organic Foods Have No Nutrition", "Health Surprise : Organic Foods Are Being Discounted", "Health Warning : Organic Foods Could Make You Fat"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
