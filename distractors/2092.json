{"id": "2092", "article": "Attitude is an internal state that influences the choices of personal action made by the individual . Some researchers consider that attitudes come from differences between beliefs and ideas ; others believe that attitudes come from emotional states . Here , we focus on the effects of attitudes upon behavior , that is , upon the choices of action made by the individual . The kinds of actions taken by human beings are obviously influenced greatly by attitudes . Whether one listens to classical music or rock , whether one obeys the speed limit while driving , whether one encourages one ' s husband or wife to express his or her own ideas - - all are influenced by attitudes . These internal states are acquired throughout life from situations one is faced with in the home , in the streets , and in the school . Of course , the course of action chosen by an individual in any situation will be largely determined by the particulars of that situation . An individual who has a strong attitude of obeying laws may drive too fast when he is in a hurry and no police cars in sight . A child who has a strong attitude of honesty may steal a penny when she thinks no one will notice . But the internal state which remains unchanged over a period of time , and which makes the individual behave regularly in a variety of situations , is what is meant by an attitude . Attitudes are learned in a variety of ways . They can result from single incidents , as when an attitude toward snakes is acquired by an experience in childhood at the sudden movement of a snake . They can result from the individual ' s experiences of success and pleasure , as when someone acquires a positive attitude toward doing crossword puzzles by being able to complete some of them . And frequently , they are learned by copying other people ' s behavior , as when a child learns how to behave toward foreigners by observing the actions of his parents . Regardless of these differences , there is something in common in the learning and modification of attitudes .", "questions": "What would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["ways of attitudes .", "nature of attitude .", "changes of attitudes .", "changes of attitude ."], "human": ["Differences of Attitudes .", "Choices of Attitudes .", "Modification of Attitude .", "Nature of Attitude ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
