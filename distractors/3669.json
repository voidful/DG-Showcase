We ' re friends . \" \" I ' d rather pay , \" I replied . \" If it ' s free , I ca n ' t afford it . \" Chinese often refuse payment for professional services , insisting , \" We ' re friends now ! \" But then they show up later to ask me to tutor them in English , or get them into an American university , and I wish I ' d have just paid the 30 yuan I owed them in the first place . According to the Americans , \" There ' s no free lunch , \" meaning that there ' s a price for everything , and I ' m always looking around to figure out what this means .

Chinese generosity is a real education for Americans like me , who would rather avoid social entanglements and just hand over the money . But cash ca n ' t make up for the greatest gift - friendship . When an American saw some of my friends sitting on bamboo stools under the trees , sipping tea , he said , \" They must have nothing better to do . \" \" Actually , \" I said , \" they are professors , with plenty to do . But probably you ' re right in saying that , at this moment , they have nothing better to do . And neither do I . \" And I joined the group .

How time flies . \" How life flies . And Chinese are smart enough to share what they know they can not keep . They freely give of their time , never too busy to help a friend . And they are teaching me , slowly , to both give and receive . So the next time someone says , \" No charge . We ' re friends . \" I will thank them heartily .
