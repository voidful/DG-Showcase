{"id": "3109", "article": "A unique thermo - solar power station Germasolar in southern Spain can work even on cloudy days : energy stored when the sun shines lets it produce electricity even during the night . It is the first solar power station in the world that works 24 hours a day ! This is how it works : the panels reflect the sun ' s rays onto the tower , transmitting energy 1 , 000 times stronger than that of the sun ' s rays reaching the earth . Energy is stored in tanks , and then steam is produced before finally turned into electricity . It is the station ' s capacity to store plenty of energy that makes Gemasolar so different because it allows the plant to transmit power during the night , relying on energy it has gained during the day . Helped by the generous state aid , renewable energies have enjoyed a boom in Spain , the world number two in solar energy and the biggest wind power producer in Europe , ahead of Germany . For the Gemasolar solar product , foreign investors helped too : Torresol Energy is a joint enterprise between the Spanish engineering group Sener , which holds 60 percent , and Abu Dhabi - financed renewable energy firm Masdar . This type of station is expensive , not because of the raw material we use , which is free solar energy , but because of the enormous investment these plants require . The investment cost is over 200 million euros ( $ 260 million ) . But the day when the business has repaid that money to the banks ( maybe , in 18 years , someone estimates ) , this station will become a 1 , 000 - euro note printing machine ! For now , the economic crisis has nevertheless cast a shadow over this kind of project : Spain is battling to cut its deficit as it slides into a difficult time and has cancelled aid to new renewable energy projects .", "questions": "What can we learn from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["energy can be used in all the ways of using .", "energy can be used in the solar power station .", "germasolar will make fortunes in the future ."], "human": ["Spain is building more energy projects .", "The Spanish government will aid renewable energy projects .", "Germasolar will make fortunes in the future ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
