{"id": "2802", "article": "After an absence of thirty years , I decided to visit my old school again . I had expected to find changes , but not a completely different building . As I walked up the school drive , I wondered for a moment if I had come to the right address . The dirty red brick houses had been swept away . In its place stood a bright , modern block . A huge expanse of glass extended across the face of the building , and in front , there was a well - kept lawn where previously there had been \" an untidy gravel yard \" . I was pleased to find that it was bread time and that the children were all in the playground . This would enable me to meet some members of staff . On entering the building , I was surprised to hear loud laughter coming from what appeared to be the masters ' common room . I could not help remembering the teachers in my time , all dressed in black gowns and high collars . And above all , I recalled Mr Garston whom we had nicknamed \" Mr Ghastly \" , the headmaster who had iron discipline on staff and pupils alike . I knocked at the common room door and was welcomed by a smiling young man who introduced himself to me as the headmaster . He was dressed casually in a sports jacket , and his cheerful manner , quickly dispelled the image of Mr Ghastly . After I had explained who I was , the headmaster presented me to the teachers all of whom were a little younger than himself , and said he would take me round the school . Here the biggest surprise of all was _ me . Gone were the heavy desks of old with their deeply carved names ; gone too , were the dark classrooms with their ink stained , dark brown walls , and their raised platforms for the teachers . The rooms now were painted in bright colors , and the children , far from sitting straight in their places , seemed almost free to do as they liked . I looked with envy as I remembered how , as a child , I had looked at the blackboard hardly daring to whisper to my neighbor .", "questions": "Which of the following statements is NOT true ?", "options": {"model": ["he was angry when the school was closed .", "he had expected that the school had completely changed .", "it took the school a long time to make the school more old ."], "human": ["In the writer ' s time , all the teachers were dressed in black gowns and high collars .", "There was a well - kept lawn in their school when he visited it .", "He had expected that the school had completely changed ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
