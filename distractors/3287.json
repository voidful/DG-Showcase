{"id": "3287", "article": "If you are not any kind of a longtime A - list New Yorker celebrity like Woody Allen , chances are that you have never experienced , and will never experience - a meal in a legendary Italian - American restaurant called Rao ' s . Rao ' s , the East Harlem restaurant with a history of more than l00 years , is simply the toughest restaurant to get a reservation in the US , if not the world . Michelin three - star restaurants like elBulli in Spain , often ranked the world ' s top restaurant , would sell out the second phone lines opened . But in the case of Rao ' s , the phone lines never open . There are about a dozen tables in the tiny restaurant , and each is spoken for , semi - permanently , as regulars have had their reservations for years , and when they ca n ' t use them , they often gift them to friends . The place is so small that the owners rarely have the flexibility to do favors even for people they know . Since it is always busy , there has never been a need for publicity . The last remarkable national review of the restaurant came from The New York Times more than 35 years ago . It was already tough to get a table at Rao ' s but reservations have been non - existent ever sincce the magic review . According to a critic who is \" very , very lucky to have dined at Rao ' s a few times , \" the experience rivals the tasty food . There are no menus at Rao ' s , and one of the owners will pull up a chair and run through the massive list of options , allowing people to have diner by mixing and matching nearly any ingredient with any classical Italian style of cooking . The place does n ' t take credit cards , is n ' t open on weekends or for 1unch , and \" at some point during your meal the one - room restaurant will almost unavoidably break out in song . \" It is truly one of a kind , \" the critic wrote .", "questions": "Which of the following about Rao ' s is true ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s easy to get a table at catering .", "it ' s a restaurant with a history of more than l00 years .", "it ' s hard to get a table in a restaurant .", "it ' s hard fo dine in rao ' s partly because it has a limited number of tables ."], "human": ["If yoh want to get a reservation in Rao ' s , you ' d have to phone ahead of time .", "Rao ' s history is much longer than that of elBulli in Spain .", "Only the most famous persons can have the chance to have lunch in Rao ' s .", "It ' s hard fo dine in Rao ' s partly because it has a limited number of tables ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
