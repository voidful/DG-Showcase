{"id": "725", "article": "MELBOURNE , Australia - A kangaroo frightened by a man walking his dog attacked the pair , throwing the pet underwater and hitting the owner in the stomach with its back legs . The Australian , Chris Rickard , was in stable condition Monday after the attack , which ended when the 49 - year - old struck the kangaroo in the throat . Rickard said he was walking his blue dog , Rocky , on Sunday morning when they surprised a sleeping kangaroo in Arthur ' s Creek northeast of Melbourne . The dog chased the animal into a pond , when the kangaroo turned and knocked the pet underwater . When Rickard tried to pull his dog free , the kangaroo turned on him , attacking with its back legs and tearing a deep cut into his stomach and across his face . \" I thought I might take action to drag the dog out from under his grasp , but I did n ' t expect him to actually attack me , \" Rickard , 49 , told The Herald Sun newspaper . \" It was a shock at the start because it was a kangaroo , about 5 feet high , they do n ' t go around killing people . \" \" I was stuck having to hold on to the dog with both hands because it was half drowned and I could n ' t really see anything because the kangaroo just attacked me . \" He added , \" All I could do was just keep pushing for the bank and he was trying to push me under the water , so at that point I struck him in the throat and that made him back off a little bit . \" I do n ' t think I ' ll ever be able to watch kangaroo programs quite the same as I used to - - it might bring back a couple of bad memories . \" Kangaroos rarely attack people but will fight if they feel threatened . Dogs often chase kangaroos , which have been known to lead the pets into water and defend themselves there . Rickard said he ended the attack by hitting the kangaroo in the throat adding Rocky was \" half - drowned \" when he pulled him from the water .", "questions": "In Australia , kangaroos", "options": {"model": ["get along rather peacefully with people", "are easily killed by dogs"], "human": ["frequently attack people and pets", "get along rather peacefully with people"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
