{"id": "895", "article": "John Nash , a Nobel Prize winner and a mathematical genius whose struggle with mental illness was documented in the Oscar - winning film A Beautiful Mind , was killed in a car accident on May 24th , 2015 . Born in West Virginia , Nash displayed a keenness for mathematics early in life , independently proving Femret ' s little theorem before graduating from high school . By the time he turned 30 in 1958 , he was an unquestionable academic celebrity . At Princeton , Nash published a 27 - page thesis that led to applications to economics , international politics , and evolutionary biology . His signature solution - known as a \" Nash Equilibrium \" - found that competition among two opponents , not necessarily governed by zero - sum logic . Two opponents can , for instance , each achieve their maximum objectives through cooperating with the other , or gain nothing at all by refusing to cooperate . It is now regarded e , one of the most important social science ideas in the 20th century . In the late 1950s , Nash began a slide into mental illness . By the time Nash was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994 , he had n ' t published a paper in 36 years . But like a child cured of a nightmare by the switch of a light , Nash recovered from his illness seemingly by choosing not to be sick anymore . He continued to work , travel , and speak at conferences for the rest of his life . In 2001 , the release of the film A Beautiful Mind , based an Sylvia Nasar ' s 1998 book of the same name , introduced Nash ' s unusual life story to an international audience .", "questions": "John Nash passed away because of", "options": {"model": ["a traffic accident", "a car accident"], "human": ["a mental illness", "a traffic accident"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
