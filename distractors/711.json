{"id": "711", "article": "Each spring brings a new wildflower blooming in the fields along the highway I travel daily to work . There is one particular blue flower that has always caught my eye . I ' ve noticed that it blooms only in the morning hours . The afternoon sun is too warm for it . Every day each year for about two weeks , I see those beautiful flowers . This spring , I started a wildflower garden in my yard . I can look out of the kitchen window while doing the dishes and see the flowers . I ' ve often thought that those lovely blue flowers from the fields would look great in that bed alongside other wildflowers . Every day I drove past the flowers , thinking , \" I ' ll stop on my way home and dig them . \" \" Gee , I do n ' t want to get my good clothes dirty . . . \" Whatever the reason , I never stopped to dig them . My husband even gave me a tool one year for that expressed purpose . One day on my way home from work , I was saddened to see that the highway department had cleared up the fields and the pretty blue flowers were gone . I thought to myself , \" Way to go , you waited too long . You should have done it when you first saw them blooming this spring . \" A week ago we were shocked and saddened to learn that my oldest sister - in - law has a cancer . She is 20 years older than my husband and unfortunately , because of age and distance , we have n ' t been as close as we all would have liked . I could n ' t help but see the connection between the pretty blue flowers and the relationship between my husband ' s sister and us . I do believe that God has given us some time left to plant some wonderful memories that will bloom every year for us . And yes , if I see the blue flowers again , I ' m sure I ' ll stop and transplant them to my wildflower garden .", "questions": "What does the writer want to tell us ?", "options": {"model": ["value now and do n ' t lose chances .", "love my husband and brother .", "make good use of the wildflowers ."], "human": ["Refresh our wonderful moments every year .", "Plant flowers and do n ' t enjoy them in the field .", "Value now and do n ' t lose chances ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
