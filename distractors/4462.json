The study showed that being sad could help people to judge others more correctly and was also good for the memory . The study was carried out by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales . \" People in a bad mood paid more attention to the people and things around them than happy people . Happy people were more likely to believe anything they were told , \" said Forgas For the study , Forgas and his team did a lot of experiments . During the experiments , they made the participants feel happy or sad by watching films and thinking about good or bad things of the past . In one of the experiments , happy and sad participants were asked to judge whether some wrong things were true or not . The results showed that people in a bad mood were less likely to believe that these things were true . People in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw . The study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style . In fact , the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful .", "questions": ".
