{"id": "4693", "article": "Leopards live in many parts of the world , from Siberia to Africa . They have a very beautiful yellow skin with large black spots . They live for about 15 years and eat small mammals such as zebras , monkeys , and antelopes . They sleep for about 12 hours a day . Leopards are very solitary animals . They spend most of their time alone in trees , where they wait until a small animal passes . They jump on the animal and then drag it up into the tree , where they eat it . Like many animals , leopards are disappearing because people hunt them . They kill them for their beautiful coats . The Sinai leopard , for example , from Egypt , is now probably extinct .", "questions": "Leopards", "options": {"model": ["live alone", "live for about 15 years"], "human": ["live with other animals", "live alone"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
