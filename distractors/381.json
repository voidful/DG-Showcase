{"id": "381", "article": "I ' ve tried to explain compound interest to my eight - year - old daughter . When I have finished it , she summarizes back to me , \" So , you are saying if I put $ 100 in the bank , when I turn sixteen the bank will give me $ 200 ? \" She has already grasped more of the concept than I understood at her age , but she could n ' t clearly understand that until she sees them in action . One day I gave her a Ziploc bag with a handful of pennies and told her over the course of a week I wanted her to give me a penny a day . I would deposit the penny in \" The Bank of Dad \" and compound interest would begin to accumulate the day she deposited the penny . At the end of the week we would check her bank balance . Each day my daughter handed over one penny at the breakfast table and I deposited it in her bank . I gave her a \" receipt \" for her deposit and explained that she needed to keep up with the receipts to see how much money she had added to her account . In an effort to make this a little more realistic , I deposited a penny from my own piggy bank every other day to give her an additional four pennies at the end of the week . On Sunday evening we gathered receipts and confirmed she had deposited seven pennies in \" The Bank of Dad . \" Then I opened the old film container and counted out its contents - - all eleven pennies . \" Hey , there are four extra pennies in there ! \" I explained that her original seven pennies had grown to eleven pennies because every couple days the bank paid her a penny for letting them use her money - - that ' s interest . She paused and asked , \" Dad , what would happen if you deposited like a hundred million pennies in the bank ?", "questions": "Each day the writer ' s daughter", "options": {"model": ["filled a lot of a lot of pennies", "got a lot of pennies", "handed over one penny to her father"], "human": ["got a penny from her father", "deposited a penny in her piggy bank", "handed over one penny to her father"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
