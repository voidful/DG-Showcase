{"id": "1324", "article": "My eighth grade consisted of 28 classmates . We knew each other so well that most of us could distinguish each other ' s handwriting at a glance . Although we grew up together , we still had class outcasts . From second grade on , a small group started harassing two or three of the others . I was one of those two or three , though I did n ' t know why . In most cases when children get picked on , they are n ' t good at sports or they read too much or they wear the wrong clothes or they are of a different race . But in my class , we all read too much and did n ' t know how to play sports . We had also been brought up to carefully respect each other ' s race . This is what was so strange about my situation . Usually , people are made outcasts because they are in some way different from the larger group . But in my class , large differences did not exist . It was as if the outcasts were invented by the group out of a need for them . The harassment came in the form of laughter when I talked , and rolled eyes when I turned around . If I was out on the playground and approached a group of people , they often fell silent . Sometimes , someone would not see me coming and I would catch the tail end of a joke at my expense . There was another girl in our class who was perhaps even more rejected than I . She provided the group with a lot of material for jokes . One day one popular girl came up to me to show me something she said I would n ' t want to miss . We walked to a comer of the playground . Three or four girls there were reading aloud from a small book , which I was told was the girl ' s diary . I sat down and , laughing till my sides hurt , heard my voice finally mixed with the others . Often being accepted by others is more satisfying than being accepted by oneself , even though the satisfaction does not last . Looking back , I wonder how I could have participated in making fun of this girl when I knew perfectly well how it felt . If I were in that situation today I would react differently , but I ca n ' t honestly be sure .", "questions": "What does the passage intend to tell us ?", "options": {"model": ["it is not easy to get along with people in class .", "everyone has a desire to be accepted by others ."], "human": ["We should n ' t hit a person when he is down .", "Everyone has a desire to be accepted by others ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
