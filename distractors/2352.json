{"id": "2352", "article": "A Robot Fish has been developed by National University of Singapore ' s researchers from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering . This robot fish has movements which have been inspired by the movements of the carp . There are various purposes that it can be used for . It can help in underwater archaeology ( ) . For example , it can enter a sunken city where human divers can not enter . Just like a fish , it can also look at all the comers of particular wreckage . This robot can also be used for general purposes such as detection of leakages in a pipeline or for laying down communication cables across oceans . It also has possible military uses . In order to copy carp movements , Mr . Fan studied the movements of the fish for around 3 months . He studied all the different movements of carp using different cameras and then converted these movements mathematically to transfer this data to the robot using many actuators . Professor Xu commented on the robot that the current models that copy fish movements are capable only of 2D movements which limits their capability as they are not able to dive into water . He said that his model is the first model with 3D movements which allows it to dive as well as float with the help of its fins , just as a normal fish would do . Hence , this fish model robot has much greater movement capability . It would be much harder for enemies to detect as compared to traditional ones when used for military purposes . The researches want to make their robot fish even smaller , more realistic while adding more sensors such as GPS and video camera to it . This will improve its autonomous 3D movement . They are also planning to test the fish by giving it more difficult tasks such as detecting various objects .", "questions": "Which of the following would be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["new robots in singapore and the future", "the influence of a robot fish", "the influence of robot fish in singapore", "first robot fish with autonomous 3d movement created in singapore"], "human": ["First Robot Fish with Autonomous 3D Movement used widely", "First Robot Fish with Autonomous 3D Movement treading the ocean", "First Robot Fish with Autonomous 3D Movement ' s general purposes", "First Robot Fish with Autonomous 3D Movement created in Singapore"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
