{"id": "709", "article": "My grandfather was a teacher . He was the headmaster of a school for boys between the ages of thirteen and eighteen . I know that he was a kind and gentle man at heart , because when I was young ( and he was old ) , he gave me presents and seated me on his knees , and told me stories . But I believe the boys at his school were afraid of him . At school , when he walked into a classroom full of noisy boys , those boys went red in the faces , and looked down at their shoes . If a boy brought his poor , careless work , which was not the best that boy could do , my grandfather picked up the boy ' s work and threw it across the room , shouting , \" Do it all again , and bring it back early tomorrow morning ! \" If the boy was late , or if he forgot to bring the work , he had to do it again . My grandfather never forgot . He was a very different man at school , from the man I saw day by day in his own home .", "questions": "When he received poor work , my grandfather", "options": {"model": ["threw the work across the room", "shouted at the boy and threw his work across the room", "threw the work across the room and threw it away"], "human": ["threw the work on the floor , and shouted across the room", "threw the work at the boy", "shouted at the boy and threw his work across the room"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
