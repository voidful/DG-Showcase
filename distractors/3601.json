{"id": "3601", "article": "My name is Valentine . I lived in Rome during the third century . That was long , long ago ! At that time , Rome was ruled by an emperor named Claudius . I did n ' t like Emperor Claudius , and I was n ' t the only one ! A lot of people shared my feelings . Claudius wanted to have a big army . He expected men to volunteer to join . Many men just did not want to fight in wars . They did not want to leave their wives and families . As you might have guessed , not many men signed up . This made Claudius furious . So what happened ? He had a crazy idea . He thought that if men were not married , they would not mind joining the army . So Claudius decided not to allow any more marriages . Young people thought his new law was cruel . I thought it was preposterous ! I certainly was n ' t going to support that law ! Did I mention that I was a priest ? One of my favourite activities was to marry couples . Even after Emperor Claudius passed his law , I kept on performing marriage ceremonies - - secretly , of course . It was really quite exciting . Imagine a small candlelit room with only the bride and groom and myself . We would whisper the words of the ceremony , listening all the while for the steps of soldiers . One night , we did hear footsteps . It was scary ! Thank goodness the couple I was marrying escaped in time . I was caught . I was thrown in jail and told that my punishment was death . I tried to stay cheerful . And do you know what ? Wonderful things happened . Many young people came to the jail to visit me . They threw flowers and notes up to my window . They wanted me to know that they , too , believed in love . On the day I was to die , February 14 , 269 A . D . I left my friend a little note thanking a girl , who helped me keep my spirits up , for her friendship and loyalty . I signed it , \" Love from your Valentine . \"", "questions": "The passage mainly tells us about", "options": {"model": ["the origin of valentine ' s day", "how valentine ' s day came into being"], "human": ["the Emperor of Rome", "the origin of Valentine ' s Day"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
