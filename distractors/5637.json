{"id": "5637", "article": "The interview had been going on for about 20 minutes and everything seems to be going well . Then , suddenly , the interviewer asks an unexpected question , \" Which is more important , law or Dove ? \" Job applicants in the West increasingly find themselves asked strange questions like this . And the signs are that this is beginning to happen in China . Employers want people skilled , enthusiastic and devoted . So these are the qualities that any reasonably intelligent job applicants will try to show no matter what his or her actual feelings are . In response , employers are increasingly using questions which try and show the applicant ' s true personality . The question in the first paragraph comes from a test called the Keirsey Personality Sorter . It is an attempt to discover how people solve problems , rather than what they know . This is often called an aptitude test . According to Mark Baldwin , many job applicants in China are finding this type of questions difficult . When a Chinese person fills out an aptitude test , he or she will think there is a right answer and they may fail because they try to guess what the examiner wants to see . This is sometimes called the prisoner ' s dilemma . Applicants are trying to act cleverly in their own interest . But they fail because they do n ' t understand what the interviewer is looking for . Remember that in an aptitude test , the correct answer is always the honest answer .", "questions": "The writer wrote the passage to", "options": {"model": ["explain how to find a job interview", "show you how to find a job interview", "give you a piece of advice on a job interview", "tell you how to find a job"], "human": ["tell you how to meet a job interviewer", "describe the aptitude test", "advise you how to find a job", "give you a piece of advice on a job interview"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
