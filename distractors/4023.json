{"id": "4023", "article": "On May 18 , 1969 , NASA astronauts Thomas Stafford , John Young , and Eugene Cernan boarded the Apollo 10 lunar module - - the fourth manned mission in the US Apollo Space program and only the second after Apollo 8 to circle the moon . Its mission was to circle the moon and thoroughly test the components and procedures to pave the way for the first lunar landing . The mission went perfectly without incident - - at least that ' s what every one believed . However , that view has changed since February 22 , after NASA released a digital recording of strange music heard by the space travelers . Then as they were re - entering the zone where they could communicate with ground control . One of the astronauts asked if they should report it . In response , Stafford expressed his doubts if anyone would even believe them . But they need n ' t have worried . When NASA experts listened to the recordings , they thought the strange sounds were radio interference . Michael Collins - - the Apollo 11 pilot - - said that the only reason why he was not shocked upon hearing them was that he had been forewarned by NASA officials . Collins also said that the music stopped as soon as the lunar module landed on the moon . So why did it take NASA over 40 years to release the digital recording of the awful music only after it was featured in a recent television series NASA ' s Unexplained Files ? The US Space Agency says they have not been hiding them . In the press release that accompanies the release of the recording , NASA officials state , \" The Apollo 10 audio clips were uploaded in 2012 , but the mission ' s sound recordings have been available at the National Archives for anyone that wanted to hear them since the early 1970s . \" Eugene Cernan , Apollo 10 ' s pilot who heard the sounds first , also released a statement saying , \" I do n ' t remember that incident excited me enough to take it seriously . It was probably just radio interference . Had we thought it was something other than that , we would have briefed everyone after the flight . We never gave it another thought . \" While most people are ready to accept this logical explanation , there are some that believe otherwise . They guess the music proves the presence of aliens .
