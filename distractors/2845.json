{"id": "2845", "article": "Health officials issued a waring over common energy - saving lghtbulbs after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer . A study by the Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) found that some eco - friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation that are above recognized safety limits . The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco - friendly bulbs . The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods , such as jewellery makers , and others who might have lights close to their faces , such as car mechanics . John O ' Hagan , a scientist at the HPA ' s centre for radiation , chemical and environmental dangers , began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them . Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus , which makes people highly sensitive to light . The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation , measured 2 cm from the lightbulbs , were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer . The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn , but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this , again similar to that of sunburn . The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes . People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out . It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs .", "questions": "In the next part , the author would most probably further explain", "options": {"model": ["how the government has responded to hpa ' s discovery", "how to protect the skin of the light", "whether the government has done enough to prevent skin cancers"], "human": ["why people need n ' t remove the lightbulbs from their homes", "how long people should work close to the open lightbulbs", "how the government has responded to HPA ' s discovery"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
