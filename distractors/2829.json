I told him not to worry and walked up front . One person was in line ahead of me , a little girl no more than seven with a bottle of medicine on the counter . She held a little green and white coin purse closely to her chest . The purse reminded me of the days when , as a child , I liked dressing myself up in my grandma ' s clothes . One day , wearing her large clothes and hat , I went out to buy something . I gave a fake dollar to the shop owner , but he handed back some real coins for my purse . \" Keep the change ! \" he told me with a smile . Now , with both hands shaking , the little girl pulled out a dollar bill and some coins for her medicine . As she tried to count her money , I could see right away that she was about a dollar short . Quickly , I put a dollar bill onto the counter . The child collected her change into her coin purse and ran out . As I walked to my car , I felt a tug on my shirt . There was the girl , looking up at me with her big brown eyes . She gave me a smile , and put out her little hand . It was full of coins . \" Thank you , \" she said . \" That ' s OK , \" I answered , smiling . \" Just keep the change ! \"", "questions": "The writer told the girl to keep the change because", "options": {"model": ["the gift for the change was full of coins", "the writer wanted to pass on love"], "human": ["the writer did n ' t like coins", "the writer wanted to pass on love"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
