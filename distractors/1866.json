{"id": "1866", "article": "For many of us , cartoon strips are simply one of our pastimes . The popular Japanese manga provides us with an escape from reality into a world of fantasy , adventure and romance . With much less text and pictures running for pages , it fits perfectly into today ' s fast , throwing away city lifestyle . But Tsai Chih - chung , a famous Taiwanese illustrator , does n ' t agree . He believes cartoons can be a bridge connecting traditional Chinese culture and wisdom with the modern world in a much wittier and more acceptable way . He has interpreted Lao Zi , Confucius , Mencius , Zhuang Zi and Sun Zi and made their works accessible to a global audience . He has also produced two books about Zen , introducing oriental philosophy . His cartoons are humorous yet full of wisdom and are admired as an easy way to learn Chinese classics . After avoiding the public for ten years , Tsai made a comeback in late April with seven new works . But does his age , 61 , work as a gap between him and his young readers ? Tsai does n ' t think so . The topics he has covered range from philosophy in a time of individuality to the learning and memorizing techniques used at school . \" Every child is a genius and has the potential beyond his own imagination , \" he said . If popular Japanese manga is purely for entertainment , Tsai ' s work , to a large extent , is to light the power of thinking in a light - hearted way . Tsai uses differenr forms of water to refer to people . In his eyes some people are like an ocean , some are like vapor , while others may be ice or rain . But in essence they share a similarity - human being ' s forever chasing for the true and the good . \" The person who thinks over life issues is not necessarily a scholar or a philosopher , \" he said . \" I ' ve dedicated my whole life to thinking and individual freedom , not making a living . \"", "questions": "In Tsai Chih - chung ' s opinion , cartoon", "options": {"model": ["helps connect chinese classics with modern world", "can be a bridge between the traditional chinese culture and wisdom", "is a bridge between traditional chinese culture and wisdom"], "human": ["connects traditional Chinese culture and wisdom", "uses a wiser and acceptable way to draw cartoons", "helps connect Chinese classics with modern world"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
