{"id": "793", "article": "American government suggests that children and teens should get 60 minutes of physical activity every day . But less than half of children and just 10 % of teens meet these suggestions . What ' s the deal ? It ' s reported that about 44million US kids participate in organized sports ( such as baseball , softball , soccer ) . But a new study says just one - quarter of kids get the government - recommended amount of exercise when they show up for team practices . The study , published online last month in a medical journal , says younger kids and boys do better than teens and girls . The study looked at 200 kids aged 7 to 14 who played on soccer , baseball and softball teams . The kids wore sensors to measure their activity during practices . During each practice , kids averaged 30 minutes of downtime . \" It is not clear how much physical activity is provided by youth sports practices , \" say the California - based authors of the study . \" Much of the time may be inactive , such as receiving verbal instructions and waiting for turns . \" What ' s a parent or coach - - or kid - - to do ? The authors of the study suggest increasing the number of practices , _ the time of practices and changing it up during practices . For example , the coach could give each player a ball at the same time . Rather than focusing on one player ' s skills , it ' s best to get the whole team moving . But , the study says , the bottom line is that team sports are n ' t enough exercise . For a child to meet the US physical activity suggestions , the kid will have to do more than just join a team . Exercise is also necessary during breaks , during physical education class , after school and even on the way to school .", "questions": "The passage is probably written for", "options": {"model": ["physical teachers and parents", "kids who are not active enough in sports"], "human": ["kids and headmasters", "physical teachers and parents"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
