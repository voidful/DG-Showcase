{"id": "1150", "article": "If your cellphone suddenly stops working , do n ' t blame the service provider . The malfunction might well have been caused by something bigger - - a solar storm . Experts expect that Earth will see more solar activity in the near future . The malfunction of electronic devices will just one of the effects . Sunspots serve as an indicator of the sun ' s activity . For the past two years , sunspots have mostly been missing . Their absence , the most prolonged in nearly 100 years , has taken even seasoned sun watchers by surprise . When the number of sunspots drops at the end of each 11 - year cycle , solar storms die down and all become much calmer . This \" solar minimum \" does n ' t last long . Within a year , sunspots and solar storms begin to build toward a new crescendo , the next solar maximum . What ' s special about this latest cycle is that the sun is having trouble starting the next solar cycle . The sun began to calm down in late 2007 , so no one expected many sunspots in 2008 . They should return in 2010 . Scientists have predicted that the next solar cycle could be the most active on record : more sunspots and more solar storms . However , sunspots are mostly missing now . Since the earth is in close contact with the sun , strong solar activities can bring trouble to our life . People of the 21st century rely on high - tech systems for the basics of daily life . Air travel and radio communications can be affected by strong solar activities . A big solar storm could cause 20 times more economic damage than Hurricane Katrina . What the sun will do next is beyond our ability to predict . Most astronomers think that the solar cycle will go on but at low level . However , there is also evidence that the sun is losing its ability to produce sunspots . By 2015 , they could be gone altogether .", "questions": "Which statement does the text lead you to believe ?", "options": {"model": ["sunspots can be the most active in the solar cycle .", "a sunspots will happen in the near future .", "it ' s difficult to predict sunspots .", "the solar cycle will go on ."], "human": ["Solar activities do no harm to our daily life .", "Hurricane Katrina is also a type of solar storms .", "From now on there ' re no sunspots .", "It ' s difficult to predict sunspots ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
