{"id": "3510", "article": "I am a strong believer that if a child is raised with approval he learns to love himself and will be successful in his own way . Several weeks ago , I was doing homework with my son in the third grade and he kept standing up from his chair . I kept asking him to sit down , telling him that he would concentrate better . He sat but seconds later , as if he did n ' t even notice he was doing it , he got up again . I was getting annoyed , but then it hit me : I started noticing his answers were much quicker and right when he stood up . Could he be focused while standing up ? This made me start questioning myself and what I had been raised to believe . I was raised to believe that a quiet child was more likely to succeed . This child would have the discipline to study hard , get good grades and become someone important in life . Kids that were active and loud would only be objects of stares . Now people perhaps come to realize that their kids are born with their own sets of DNA and personality features , and all they can do is loving and accepting them . As parents , throughout their growing years and beyond that , we need to be our kids ' best cheerleaders , guiding them and helping them find their way . I have stopped asking my son to sit down and concentrate . Obviously , he is concentrating , just in his own way and not mine . We need to accept our kids , and their ways of doing things . This way may have worked for me but does n ' t mean we need to carry it through generations . There is nothing sweeter than seeing our children being individual . It makes us happy and that ' s just the way I want my kids to live life .", "questions": "What does the author think of teaching children ?", "options": {"model": ["children can not be taught in the same way .", "children should be taught to be independent of others ."], "human": ["Children should n ' t be punished .", "Children can not be taught in the same way ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
