{"id": "1051", "article": "Handball is a hugely popular sport in Europe and Asia , and it is one of the fastest and most exciting sports in the world . It combines basketball and soccer with the attracting saves of water polo . Handball is played on an indoor court ( the size of two basketball courts ) and there are goals at each end . There are twelve players on each team , two goal keepers and ten field players , but there is a maximum of one goalkeeper and six field players from each team allowed on the court at any one time . The idea is simple : score more goals than the other team . The ball is made of leather or synthetic material and it must be round . The surface must not be shiny or slippery . The size and weight of the ball varies for male and female teams , and adult and junior teams . Handball has the same free - ranging play as basketball , with all players except the goalkeeper constantly moving from attack to defence . The goalkeeper uses hands , feet , head and body to keep out the other team ' s shots . The origins of handball are unclear . Many people believe that it developed as a training game for soccer , to be played in the off season , or when it snowing .

Handball has been played at the Olympics since 1972 .", "questions": "The statement , \" The idea is simple \" , emphasizes that in handball the", "options": {"model": ["game has only one purpose", "game is played on an indoor court"], "human": ["players can change positions", "game has only one purpose"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
