{"id": "1370", "article": "At the end of every British summer I find myself praying for a proper winter , one that will allow a bit of fun : sledging , snowballing , snowman - building . I ' m not very demanding ; I do n ' t need amazing downhill skiing and the Cresta Run . What I want is a few days out with the kids . And , much as I like blue skies and sun in summer , I ' d exchange it every time for frozen ponds , a hillside covered in fresh snow and ice hanging off the houses . Maddy , 11 , wants the same and so , instead of waiting and hoping , we are going to make sure . We are going to Sweden . Winter fun in Sweden is a bit more advanced than in most of the UK . They do snowshoeing , ice - fishing , snow house - building and so on . They also do lots of Father Christmas matters , which Maddy did n ' t want : \" I ' m too old for that kind of nonsense , Dad . \" Above all , what Maddy wanted was dogs with puppies . She ' s not too old for that . We flew to Lulea , a city at the top of the finger of Baltic Sea that reaches out to the north between Sweden and Finland , almost touching the Arctic Circle , then transferred , with some other winter - hungry families , to woodland houses by the sea . There was plenty of snow and ice , but the guides were keeping a nervous eye on the instrument for measuring temperature , which was dangerously close to zero . \" Normally , we are 10degC below , \" said Roger , our guide , who was also handing out our equipment for the days ahead : snowshoes , boots , gloves and so on . A holiday that provides all the necessary outfits will save you a fortune .", "questions": "What ' s the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["winter fun in lulea .", "the influence of winter in the uk ."], "human": ["Ice - fishing in Lulea .", "Winter Fun in Lulea ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
