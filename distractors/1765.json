{"id": "1765", "article": "Swimming in the water of Hawaii ' s Big Island is a fun experience . But it can be more exciting if there are dolphins swimming around and jumping out of the sea too . For many people , it would be a wonderful dream to swim with these lovely animals ! However , this may not be good for dolphins . They may get hurt because of human interaction . Dolphins are active and usually look for food at night . In the day , they like to rest in shallow bays . Many people think the dolphins are awake during the day as they swim . But when they sleep they rest half of their brain and keep the other half awake to breathe , so they may be sleeping even when they ' re swimming in the water . From 2010 to 2013 , spinner dolphins of Hawaii ' s Big Island were exposed to human activities more than 82 percent of the time , according to Julian Tyne , a researcher at Australia ' s Murdoch University . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) says disturbing the animals in their near - shore habitat could force them to swim to less favorable places , putting them at risk of attack by sharks and other animals . Besides , when people are around , dolphins become more active . Thus , they ca n ' t get enough sleep . \" Disturbing their resting behaviors can actually affect their long term health and the health of the dolphin population , \" Ann Garrett of NOAA ' s National Marine Fisheries Service told the Associated Press . As a result , the NOAA wants to make rules to help protect the dolphins . For example , the agency may ban swimming with the Hawaii spinner dolphins . Or they may stop people from swimming in shallow bays when the dolphins are resting . Tour operators must also be taught to watch for signs to know when the dolphins are in their resting state .", "questions": "Which of the following about dolphins is NOT true ?", "options": {"model": ["they do n ' t like swimming in the sea .", "they do n ' t like to swim in the water of hawaii ' s big island .", "they do n ' t like to swim in the water .", "they spend most of their time sleeping at night ."], "human": ["They like to stay in shallow bays during the day .", "They keep half of their brain awake while sleeping .", "They may be sleeping even when they ' re swimming .", "They spend most of their time sleeping at night ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
