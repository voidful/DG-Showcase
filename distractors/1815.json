{"id": "1815", "article": "I no longer consider myself as the center of the universe . I show up . I listen . I try to laugh . I am a good friend to my husband . I have tried to make marriage vows mean what they say . I am a good friend to my friends , and they come . Without them , there would be nothing to say to you today . So here ' s what I want to tell you today : Get a life . A real life , not a desire of the next promotion , the bigger paycheck , the larger house . Get a life in which you are not alone . Find people you love , and who love you . And remember that love is not leisure , it is work . Pick up the phone . Send an e - mail . Write a letter . And realize that life is the best thing and that you have no business taking it for granted . It is so easy to waste our lives , our days , our hours , and our minutes . It is so easy to exist instead of to live . I learned to live many years ago . Something really , really bad happened to me , something that changed my life in ways that , if I had my choice , it would never have been changed at all . And what I learned from it is what , today , seems to be the hardest lesson of all . I learned to love the journey , not the destination . I learned to look at all the good in the world and try to give some of it back because I believed in it , completely and totally . And I tried to do that , in part , by telling others what I had learned . By telling them this : Read in the backyard with the sun on your face . Learn to be happy . And think of life as a deadly illness , because if you do , you will live it with joy and passion as it ought to be lived .", "questions": "It can be inferred from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["the author is a good friend to her friends", "the author is a success in personal life"], "human": ["the author did n ' t try her best to work well", "the author is a success in personal life"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
