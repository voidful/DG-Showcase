{"id": "1017", "article": "People in the UK often talk about their homes : their mortgages , the interest rates , and rising prices . Here ' s a guide to some of the words and phrases you might come across . It ' s a good idea in the UK to arrange a mortgage with a bank before you start looking . This is when the bank tells you how much money they will lend you so you have a good idea of how much you can afford . The next step is to go to an estate agent and see what sort of properties they have available in your budget range and in your area . If you see something you like , the estate agent will arrange for you to view the property , so that you can see the house or flat for yourself . If you see something that takes your eye , you put in an offer . The vendor can accept or decline this offer , and if the vendor accepts it , you can move forward with the sale . However , as you do n ' t pay any money at this point , the offer is n ' t legally binding , and in theory , you can pull out of the offer at any time that you like . Your next step will probably be to get a structural survey done . A qualified surveyor will inspect the house and write a report that illustrates any structural problems , like damp or drainage problems . If you still want to go ahead with the sale , you need to appoint a lawyer to do the legal paperwork . . If you already own a house , you might also be busy trying to sell it . Many house owners prefer to sell to first - time buyers ( those people who do n ' t already own a home ) , as they are not in a chain ( waiting for other people to buy the house before they can buy their next house ) . Finally , once the contracts are signed and exchanged , you complete on your house . You get the keys and you can move in whenever you want . Then you might want to throw a house - warming party .
