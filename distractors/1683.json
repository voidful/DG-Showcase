After decades of skimpy skirts and sleeveless tops on game days , some schools in the US are saying cheerleader uniforms will have to meet stricter dress codes when they are worn in class .

Even male cheerleaders , whose pants and tops meet dress codes , chose not to wear their outfits to show unity . \" I understanding , because they are kind of short , \" said Holly Bishop , 14 , a Lake Minneola High School cheerleader , about her miniskirt . \" It would have been really , really cool to wear them to", "questions": "Which of the following statement is TRUE according to the article ?", "options": {"model": ["we ' d like to wear the uniforms in the us .", "school administrators believe cheerleader uniforms do not match school dress codes .", "we ' d like to wear the uniforms if we did n ' t want to go to school .", "students who wear school uniforms are not allowed to wear ."], "human": ["Most cheerleaders show understanding of the new dress codes .", "Sheila Noone believes that cheerleading miniskirts are not revealing .", "School administrators do n ' t take cheerleading seriously .", "School administrators believe cheerleader uniforms do not match school dress codes ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
