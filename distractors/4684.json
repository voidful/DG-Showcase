{"id": "4684", "article": "Ask any student which subject he or she hates most . 9 out of 10 students will answer \" math \" . No matter which country you visit , no matter which grade you are in , you may not learn art , geography , chemistry or Chinese , but you always learn math . Why is this so ? How come so many students hate math , and yet can not avoid learning it in school ? Jenny Sanders , a high school student in California , asks , \" What good do we get from learning math ? We can use computers to compute numbers , and we can use computers to store information . I think learning math at school is a waste of time . \" However , there is much more to math than just learning to add and subtract numbers . In fact , math is not so much about calculation as it is about learning to think logically and solving problems . Of course , Jenny was right that we can use computers to do calculations , but how would we even know how to use the computer if we ca n ' t think logically ? In short , computers are only tools when solving problems . For example , imagine you are a cook and must serve dinner to 100 guests . How should you divide your resources so that you can get the job done most efficiently ? In situations like this , the ability to think logically will get you to a reasonable answer and solve your problem .", "questions": "Which of the following is TURE according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["there is no need for students to learn math .", "90 % of the students hate learning math .", "there is no matter which country you visit , no matter which grade you are in , you may not learn art , engineering or chinese .", "there is no need to learn math in school ."], "human": ["Students can learn math well with computers .", "Math can do calculations and store information .", "Math helps students learn all the other subjects well .", "90 % of the students hate learning math ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
