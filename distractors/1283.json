Today ' s advertisements , or ads , try to get consumers to buy certain brands . Writers of advertising are so skillful that they can , sometimes persuade a consumer to wear a certain kind of clothing , eat a special kind of cereal , or see a movie . Consumers might never even want a product if they did not see or hear advertisements for it . For example , you probab1y do not need the newest cereal in the supermarket . There are probably many cereal brands on your kitchen shelves . You may not have space on a shelf for another . But if you see ads about a new cereal that is your extra - tasty and has a free prize in the box , you may want it . Advertising must get attention . To be effective , it must be exciting , entertaining , or provide some pleasure . The secret of writing good advertising copy is to offer a good idea as well as a product . The idea is what the ad is really selling . One example is an ad that says eating a certain cereal will make a person do well in sports . That cereal brand may sell better if consumers think it offers strength and energy .", "questions": "What is discussed in this passage ?", "options": {"human": ["The content of modern advertising .", "The results of modern advertising .", "The writing of modern advertising .", "The skills of modern advertising ."]}, "answer": {"human": 3}}
