The place is so small that the owners rarely have the flexibility to do favors even for people they know . Since it is always busy , there has never been a need for publicity . The last remarkable national review of the restaurant came from The New York Times more than 35 years ago . It was already tough to get a table at Rao ' s but reservations have been non - existent ever sincce the magic review . According to a critic who is \" very , very lucky to have dined at Rao ' s a few times , \" the experience rivals the tasty food .
