{"id": "1169", "article": "PITTSBURGH - For most people , snakes seem unpleasant or even threatening . But Howie Choset sees in their delicate movements a way to save lives . The 37 - year - old Carnegie Mellon University professor has spent years developing snake - like robots he hopes will eventually slide through fallen buildings in search of victims trapped after natural disasters or other emergencies . Dan Kara is president of Robotics Trends , a Northboro , Mass . - based company that publishes an online industry magazine and runs robotics trade shows . He said there are other snake - like robots being developed , mainly at universities , but did n ' t know of one that could climb pipes . The Carnegie Mellon machines are designed to carry cameras and electronic sensors and can be controlled with a joystick . They move smoothly with the help of small electric motors , or servos , commonly used by hobbyists in model airplanes . Built from lightweight materials , the robots are about the size of a human arm or smaller . They can sense which way is up , but are only as good as their human operators , Choset added . Sam Stover , a search term manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency based in Indiana , said snake - type robots would offer greater mobility than equipment currently available , such as cameras attached to extendable roles . \" It just allows us to do something we ' ve not been able to do before , \" Stover said , \" We needed them yesterday . \" He said snifter dogs are still the best search tool for rescue workers , but that they can only be used effectively when workers have access to damaged building . Stover , among the rescue workers who handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , said snake robots would have helped rescuers search flooded houses in that disaster . Choset said the robots may not be ready for use for another five to ten years , depending on funding .", "questions": "What is the text mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["howie cho market ' s idea of snake - like robots .", "the future of snake - like robots .", "snake - like robots made to aid in rescues .", "robots made to help in rescues"], "human": ["Snake - like robots used in industries .", "The development of snake - like robots .", "The working principles of snake - like robots .", "Snake - like robots made to aid in rescues ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
