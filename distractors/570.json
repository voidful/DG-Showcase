{"id": "570", "article": "All it took was a slice of Xinjiang cake to spark heated debates online over China ' s policy on ethnic minorities . Since Monday , qiegao ( cut cake ) has been a trending topic on Sina Weibo , China ' s main Twitter - like microblogging service . The cake was a reference to Xinjiang ' s famed nut cake , sometimes known by its old Turkic name baklava , a popular pastry across Central Asia and the Middle East . In Xinjiang , they are sold by Uygur vendors on tricycles who are known to charge dubious prices depending on the time and season . The ethnic flare - up started after the Yueyang police from Hunan province posted a message on their official Weibo account . It reported a dispute in Pingjiang county over an overpriced piece of nut cake between a Xinjiang Uygur vendor and a villager named \" Ling \" . Villager Ling got into a fight with a Uygur due to a misunderstanding . The verbal dispute eventually escalated into a fight and then a mass fight . As a result , two people were injured and Xinjiang nut cakes worth about 160 , 000 yuan ( US $ 25 , 000 ) were destroyed . The total damage was worth 200 , 000 yuan which included a broken motorcycle and injuries to people . Local police have detained Ling . The 16 Uygur sellers were dully compensated and sent back to Xinjiang . \" Yueyang police incident \" quickly became one of the most popular topics on Weibo . Yueyang police removed the post shortly after . As of Tuesday night , the topic was still amassing more than 66 , 000 hits . The incident is just one of many similar cases of ethnic tensions across China , notably in Xinjiang province , where deeply entrenched social and racial frictions between the dominant ethnic Han Chinese and minority Uygur Muslims occasionally spark violence . Many Uygurs living in major Chinese cities are viewed by locals as thieves , crooks and even terrorists .", "questions": "What can we infer from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s not the only ethnic tension across china ,", "most of the people in china are from china .", "it ' s a way of dealing with chinese people .", "most of the people in china are against the government ."], "human": ["Yueyang police are afraid of the Xinjiang Uygur vendor", "Many Uygurs living in major Chinese cities are viewed by locals as thieves , crooks and even terrorists .", "Villager Ling got into a fight with a Uygur due to a misunderstanding .", "It ' s not the only ethnic tension across China ,"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
