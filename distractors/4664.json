{"id": "4664", "article": "November 9 is a time for us to learn a lot more about fire . This is what to do in a fire : 1 . Shout out . Shout as loudly as you can , because people may be asleep . 2 . Call 119 . Never try to put out a fire yourself . Tell 119 where you are and what is on fire . 3 . Keep down close to the floor . There is less smoke down there , so it ' s easier to breathe and see where you are going . 4 . Test the door . If the door is cool , open it carefully . If the door is hot , do not open it ! Try to find a different way out . 5 . Get out . Do not stop to pick up anything . A fire can become very big in a few seconds ! 6 . Don ' t use the lift . Always use the stairs . The lift may go wrong and keep you inside . 7 . Don ' t go back . Even if you have left your pet or favorite toy inside , do not go back for it . Animals have a very good sense of smell . They often get out of buildings before people .", "questions": "Which of the following is not right according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["people often get out of buildings before animals .", "a fire ca n ' t be very big in a few seconds ."], "human": ["If the door is hot , try to find a different way out .", "People often get out of buildings before animals ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
