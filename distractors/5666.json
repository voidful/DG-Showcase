{"id": "5666", "article": "My challenge for you is this : to read a book for 15 minutes every single day for a month . Let me explain a bit , by telling you where the challenge came from . I have many things in common with my dad , like music taste and sense of humor , but sadly reading is n ' t one of them . I can happily spend a whole day with a book , but my dad ca n ' t read a book for longer than about 5 minutes . He reads emails , websites and papers for work , but not books . He ' s busy so I think sitting down to read for just 15 minutes a day is a good way to relax and to introduce him to reading . My dad is by no means the only person who avoids books . I know lots of people would rather relax on their computers or in front of the TV . Everyone is different and has their own interests , but I think there ' re lots of benefits to reading , which screen - based activities do n ' t have . Firstly , it ' s better for your eyes . Looking at screens can be very stressful for you eye muscles , and clearly you should avoid looking at screens for an hour before bed , to get a good night ' s sleep . One thing I personally love reading , is being transported to another world - - I would often forget the time or things around me ! Reading is a great way to switch off before you go to bed , because you think more about the world of the book , rather than the real world , so you can truly relax . I know you can be transported to a different world in a film or a TV show , but I think books do _ better . I also enjoy hearing what people are doing and finding out what they think . Reading gives me the chance to get to know hundreds of new people ! It also teaches you to see things from other people ' s point of view , and understand other people ' s decisions or opinions . With a book , you can hear everything a character is thinking or feeling - - you really can be inside someone else ' s head ! So give it a go ! Take 15 minutes when you ' re waking up , going to bed , eating too much , or having a coffee . If you read a lot , why not try 15 minutes of an English book , or pass the challenge", "questions": "Which of the following can be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["the import of reading", "15 - minute reading challenge", "15 - minute reading fun", "15 - minute reading"], "human": ["Tips for Reading English Books", "Having a Coffee While You Read", "Ways to Improve Reading Skills", "15 - Minute Reading Challenge"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
