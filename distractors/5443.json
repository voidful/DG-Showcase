Nancy gathered all her strength to get up and began walking slowly with Lizzie . The rain had become much heavier , and the water in the field was now waist high . Nancy ' s pace got slower and slower because she felt a great pain in her head . Finally , all she could do was to throw her arm around Lizzie ' s neck and try to hang on . About 20 minutes later , Lizzie managed to pull herself and Nancy out of the rising water and onto a bit of high land , which seemed like a small island in the middle of a lake of white water . Even though it was about noon , the sky was so dark and the rain and lightning was so bad that it took rescuers more than two hours to discover Nancy . A man from a helicopter lowered a rope , but Nancy could n ' t catch it . A moment later , two men landed on the small island from a ladder in the helicopter . They raised her into the helicopter and took her to the school gym , where the Red Cross had set up an emergency shelter .
