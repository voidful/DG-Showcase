{"id": "1101", "article": "I had arrived at the airport to catch an early flight home . It had been a very busy three days for me on an interstate trip with lots of meetings , business to do and new customers to meet . Then came the announcement that the flight had been delayed due to a technical problem . I could see a group of technicians and ground staff rushing about , obviously trying hard to fix the problem . I watched and listened as many of the passengers sitting near me shared their frustration about the inconvenience . As I sat waiting , I reflected on my last meeting for the day . It was not a business meeting but rather a very enjoyable and brief lunch with an old business associate and friend I had not seen for over 12 years , and who I had worked with for nearly 15 years before we lost in touch . I had been given his phone number by a customer I had visited on the first day of my trip , so I called him out of the blue and made a time for us to meet . Our lunch was spent recollecting times gone by and as well filling each other in on what had happened in our lives over the last 12 years . Our conversation was frequently interrupted with statements such as ' remember when we did . . . ' , ' whatever happened to . . . ' and of course the one we all liked to hear . . . ' you know you have n ' t changed one bit , except for a few more grey hairs . ' We both laughed and smiled as we recalled the good times and the great experiences we had shared over the 15 years we had worked together . Each event we discussed caused another recollection and everything we talked about centered on the good times . Almost at the same time , right at the end of our time together , we both said how much we both enjoyed it and that we must do it again . We agreed to catch up when I was next in town , then said our goodbyes and I was off to the airport . So with this extra time on my hands as I waited for my flight , it was great to revisit and replay in my mind all that we had talked about over lunch . I realized at that moment just how important it", "questions": "Which of the following statements will the writer most probably support ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s important for us to meet friends in time .", "we should n ' t miss our past experience when we went to the airport .", "our past experiences have a great influence on our future life .", "it ' s important for us to meet friends in the end of our life ."], "human": ["It is impossible to avoid the inconvenience caused by flight delays .", "Looking forward is more important than looking back on the past .", "It is really a pity that the good old times will never come back .", "Our past experiences have a great influence on our future life ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
