{"id": "5185", "article": "In the past , people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievement and confident that their degree would help them find a good job . However , in the past four years the job market has changed dramatically . This year ' s college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets in years . For example , Ryan Stewart , a graduate of San Jose University , got a degree in religious studies , but no job _ . He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and do n ' t have jobs , so it ' s even harder for new college graduates to find jobs . Four years ago , the future looked bright for the class of 2003 . There were many high - tech job opportunities . Graduates received many job offers , and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as insurance and paid vacations . However , \" Times have changed and it ' s a new market , \" according to Cheryl Allmen - Vinnidge of the San Jose State Career Center . Allmen - Vinniage says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago . They worked during summer vacations , they have had several internships , and they ' ve majored in one of the few fields that are still hot , like chemical engineering , accounting , or nursing , where average starting salaries have actually increased over last year . Other popular fields ( like information system management , computer science , and political science ) have seen big declines in starting salaries . Ryan Stewart ( he had hoped to become a teacher ) may just end up going back to school . \" I ' d like to teach college some day and that requires more schooling , which would be great in bad economy . \" he said . In conclusion , _ . For now , they can only hope its value will increase over time .", "questions": "The main idea of this passage is that", "options": {"model": ["the job market has changed dramatically over the past 4 years", "college graduates are losing their jobs in the past 4 years", "college graduates are losing their jobs because of the high pay", "many college graduates are losing their jobs"], "human": ["a lot of graduates are losing their jobs", "Ryan Stewart has not been able to find a job", "salaries in some fields have increased in the past year", "the job market has changed dramatically over the past 4 years"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
