{"id": "1759", "article": "Why can some people sleep through noises like a honking car or flushing toilet , while others are awakened by the lightest sound ? To find the answer , sleep researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted an unusual study of 12 self - described deep sleepers . After tests confirmed that the healthy volunteers were solid sleepers , they took part in a three - night study in the university ' s sleep laboratory . The participants spent the night in a big and comfortable room . But the room also included four speakers positioned near the top of the bed . During the night , the deep sleepers were subjected to 14 different recorded sounds , like street traffic , toilets flushing , an ice machine dispensing and an airplane flying overhead . Next door , the researchers monitored their sleep patterns and brain waves . As expected , all of the participants slept ly well , but there were differences in how they responded to the noisy interruptions . Some of the sleepers did n ' t wake up even when a sound was blasted at 70 decibels ; others were awakened by sounds at 40 or 50 decibels . The researchers discovered that the difference in a sleeper ' s reaction to noise could be predicted by the level of brain activity called \" sleep spindles ' ' . A sleep spindle is a burst of high - frequency brain activity coming from deep inside the brain during sleep . The source of the spindles is the thalamus , a part of the brain that sends sensory information to the rest of the cortex . Before the study , the Massachusetts researchers theorized that the spindles are the brain ' s way of preventing sensory information from passing through the thalamus and waking the rest of the brain during sleep . They found that the sleepers who experienced the most sleep spindles during the night were also the soundest sleepers and were least likely to be awakened by noise . Scientists already know that most people become lighter sleepers with age , most likely because older people experience less \" slow wave sleep ' ' , which is the deepest stage of sleep . People also produce fewer sleep spindles as they age . But even when controlling for the stage of sleep a person was in , the number of sleep spindles still predicted their risk for awakening because of noise .
