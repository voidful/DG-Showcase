{"id": "5055", "article": "Some people remember the things by writing notes to themselves . Then they leave the notes in obvious places , such as on the table or on the floor in the middle of the living room . I do n ' t think I like to write notes to myself . Most of the time I lose them or forget to look at them until it ' s too late . I prefer to use an alarm clock to tell me what I should do . I have ten alarm clocks in my house . They could tell me about things . For example , if I have to make a telephone call at a certain time , I ' ll set an alarm clock to go off a few minutes early and put the clock by the telephone . Or if I want to watch a certain television program , I ' ll set an alarm clock at the right time and put the clock on top of the TV set . I can remember almost anything if I use my clocks . However , sometimes an alarm clock goes off and I do n ' t know what it means . I always remember setting it , but I do not know why I set it . If the clock is by the telephone , I know I may have set it to tell me to call someone , but I ca n ' t be sure . I might have set it to tell myself that somebody was to call me at a certain time .", "questions": "Some people like to write notes to themselves so that they can", "options": {"model": ["know what it means", "find what they want to do at a certain time", "remember what to do at a certain time"], "human": ["watch a certain program", "make a phone call at a certain time", "remember what to do at a certain time"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
