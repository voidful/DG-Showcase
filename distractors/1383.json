The Search and Rescue teams ' main duty is to recover RAF personnel but in peacetime they mainly respond to civilian emergencies , dealing with more than 1 , 000 calls a year . The units deal with incidents ranging from helping those trapped by sudden major floods to rescuing people lost while out walking on hills . William , who has spent the last year on secondment to the various branches of the military to prepare for his future role as head of the armed forces , received his RAF wings following a four - month stint with the service earlier this year .
