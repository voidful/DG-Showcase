{"id": "3084", "article": "It seems hard to watch someone yawn and not to yawn ourselves . Even reading about yawning can make you do it . Now , a new study has found why yawning has such a powerful force . Yawning when others yawn , the study suggests , is a sign of pity and a form of social connection . Kids do n ' t develop this deeply rooted behavior until around age four , the study found . Kids with autism are less likely to catch yawns . In the most serious cases , they never do . Yawning might help doctors to see whether the children are developing rightly . The work could also lead to a better understanding of the ways that people communicate and connect . \" Emotional infection seems to be a born thing that connects us together , \" said Molly Helt , a graduate student in psychology at the University of Connecticut . \" Yawning may be part of that . \" Inspiration for her study came when she tried to get her own autistic son to clear his ears on an airplane . She repeatedly yawned at him , hoping he would yawn back . He never did . \" The fact that autistic kids do n ' t do it might mean they ' re really missing out on that emotional connection with people around them , \" she said . \" The biggest thing people try to figure out after birth is how we become humans and understand that humans have minds that are different from others ' , \" she added . \" Autistic people never seem to understand that . \" Like infectious laughter and crying , scientists have found that yawning is a shared experience that promotes social connection . Helt said it could fight stress after a period of being nervous and spread a feeling of calm through a group .", "questions": "According to Molly Helt ,", "options": {"model": ["it ' s easy to develop a social connection with humans", "autistic people do n ' t have a good understanding of the ways that people communicate and communicate", "yawning is a kind of emotional connection among humans"], "human": ["emotions are infectious , but yawning is not", "yawning helps clear ears on planes", "yawning is a kind of emotional connection among humans"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
