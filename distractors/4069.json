They move for different reasons : most of them move to find food more easily , but others move to get away from places that are too crowed . When cold weather comes , many birds move to warmer places to find food . Some fishes give birth in warm water and move to cold water to feed . The most famous migration is probably the migration of the fish , which is called \" salmon \" . This fish is born in fresh water but it travels many miles to salt water . There it spends its life . When it is cold , it returns to its birthplace in fresh water . Then it gives birth and dies there . In northern Europe , there is a kind of mouse . They leave their mountain homes when they become too crowded . They move down to the low land . Sometimes they move all the way to the seaside , and many of them are killed when they fall into the sea . Recently , scientists have studied the migration of a kind lobster . Every year , when the season of bad weather arrives , the lobster get into a long time and start to walk across tile floor of the ocean . Nobody knows why they do this , and nobody knows where they go . So , sometimes we know why humans and animals move from one place to another , but at other times we do n ' t .
