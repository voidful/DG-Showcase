{"id": "5547", "article": "Recently educators have been questioning \" prep school \" ( = preparatory school ) where barely literate high school athletes get their transcripts by taking courses occasionally and sometimes by taking no courses at all . The athletes then go on to famous sports universities , where they exhaust their playing years before landing back on the streets without job opportunity or college degrees . The prep school scheme was meant to avoid academic qualification rules for college athletes made years ago by the National Collegiate Athletic Association . The N . C . A . A . , which was slow to recognize the seriousness of the problem , has finally adopted policies to root it out . But those policies will not do the job unless everyone is involved , including prep schools and college athletics departments that still recruit students who do not meet academic standard . The prep school scheme sends a dangerous message to poor neighborhoods , where young people too often ignore their studies , believing that they will magically become millionaires once the world sees their athletic talents . Even worse , it encourages students to drop out of traditional schools before graduation - - at which point their grade - point averages would be written in stone - - to sign up with fake schools that can help them rewrite their academic records . The N . C . A . A . has begun to check nontraditional schools for their academic programs and has actually closed some . The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes ' transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools , showed sudden jumps in grade - point average , transferred to another school late in the senior year or took an unbelievable number of courses in one term . These measures are encouraging as far as they go . But the N . C . A . A . will need to go much deeper into the problem if it hopes to break this scheme . For starters , it needs to make clear not just what courses high school athletes need to take to become qualified for college sports , but when they should take them . Until that happens , those who recruit young athletes will always be tempted to make fake academic record at the last possible moment for them .", "questions": "What might be the author ' s attitude towards the prep school scheme ?", "options": {"model": ["the writer thinks more practical measures are needed to break it .", "the writer is against the prep school plan .", "the writer thinks the prep school scheme will be improved ."], "human": ["The writer thinks it a chance for high school athletes to go to college .", "The writer believes poor children will have little chance to go to college if prep school scheme is broken .", "The writer thinks more practical measures are needed to break it ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
