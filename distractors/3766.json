{"id": "3766", "article": "This is the legal part of the show . It ' s just so everybody knows the rules for Nickelodeon on the Web . Be sure to get your parents to review and discuss these rules with you : 1 . All the toys and games here are just for you to play with . You ca n ' t sell them , give them to anyone , or pretend you made them . You ca n ' t do anything EXCEPT play with them , unless you ask us first and we say it ' s OK . 2 . If you see something you do n ' t like , remember that all the stuff on the message boards , chat rooms and \" Write to Nick \" comes straight from other kids , not from someone at nick . com . Nick . com would n ' t tell kids what to say , because kids have minds of their own ! But if someone sends ugly messages , we ' ll do our best to take care of it . We all want nick . com to be a good , clean place to hang out . 3 . If you write something that catches our eye in \" Write to Nick \" on a message board or in a chat room , we might want to use it on the site . By sending in your thoughts and hanging out in the chat rooms , and getting your parent ' s permission to do so , you and your parents are telling us it ' s OK to repeat what you say . It ' s even OK to put it in an advertisement . It means we can use it in any way we want , anywhere , until the end of time . Remember to ALWAYS check with your parents before you send anything to us . And of course , the folks in the legal office upstairs have their own code for saying all that . Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using this website . This site at nick . com is fully controlled and operated by Nickelodeon Online , a business unit of MTV Networks .", "questions": "What is the passage mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["the rules about how to use this web .", "the rules for kids to use the website ."], "human": ["The toys and the chat rooms on web .", "The rules about how to use this web ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
