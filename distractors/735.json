{"id": "735", "article": "It was my first day of high school , and I was late . My next class , Spanish , scared me . I just could not speak that language . As the bell rang , I ran to the classroom . At the door , a hand reached out and shook mine firmly . I looked up . A man with large glasses smiled . He introduced himself as Profe , which means teacher in Spanish . Right away , his warm smile and welcoming words eased my fears . That year , I enjoyed his classes a great deal because I learned more than just Spanish . I admit I only speak a little Spanish . But I try to live out the life lessons I learned from Profe . Every day Profe stood outside his classroom before and after class to give his \" hand hug \" . After school his room was always filled with students and he would talk to and chat with them - - even those not in his class . He taught me that every person is worth your time . One time , I was rejected by my friends , Profe told me , \" Linda , life gives you ashes . But learning its lessons will turn those ashes to jewels . \" Therefore , I learned to look at my troubles differently and not to fear any difficulty . In my senior year , I became president of one of the school ' s clubs , so I was very busy . Many times I did n ' t even have time to buy lunch . He served me by giving me his food as well as advice . He lived out what he taught us to do : serve others . The author William Arther Ward wrote : \" The mediocre teacher tells . The good teacher explains . The superior teacher demonstrates . The great teacher inspires . \" Thank you , Profe , for inspiring me .", "questions": "How did Profe treat his class and his students ?", "options": {"model": ["he taught the students a lesson at school .", "he lived out what he taught in class ."], "human": ["He only talked with those students in his class .", "He lived out what he taught in class ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
