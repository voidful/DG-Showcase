But I know the truth about that . My mother found out from Troubled ' s mother .

' hanging over the fireplace . \" said Tremor . \" I guess Santa does n ' t have a sense of humour , \" sighed Trogmire . \" Well , at least I ' m not the only one who Santa scratched off his name list . \"", "questions": "Trogmire and Troubled do n ' t believe in Santa because", "options": {"model": ["santa claus does n ' t believe in them", "they do n ' t believe in santa", "santa does n ' t give them anything"], "human": ["Santa has no sense of humor", "Tremor convinced them he was n ' t real", "Santa does n ' t give them anything"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
