{"id": "3143", "article": "Scientists and religious experts are debating the value of a small piece of papyrus that found its way to a researcher in the United States . The piece of paper raises an ages - old question about Jesus , whose life and teachings form the heart of Christianity . Could Jesus have been married ? Harvard Divinity School Professor Karen King recently explained the Coptic wording on the papyrus . She says the words mean that Jesus called Mary Magdalene , an early Christian , \" my wife . \" She says he did this while speaking to his disciples , or followers . \" I do n ' t think that this text is that significant . There are so many barriers for it to get over . You ' ve got to show that it ' s reliable , and there are real questions about whether that text is reliable . \" Professor Bock expresses other concerns about the papyrus . For example , he says , there is not enough writing on it to establish the real meaning of the words . He says the word \" wife \" may not mean \" wife \" in the traditional way . And , he says the papyrus is just one text showing that Jesus might have been married . \" And then you ' ve got the fact that this is one text out of many , many , many texts that do n ' t indicate that Jesus was married . And I think had Jesus been married , the early tradition about Jesus would have reflected that . \"", "questions": "Professor Bock does n ' t think that Jesus was married for the following reasons EXCEPT that", "options": {"model": ["the meaning of the words \" wife \" has nothing to do with the papyrus .", "the word \" wife \" has the same meaning as the papyrus .", "the word \" wife \" ca n ' t have the same meaning as it had in the long past .", "the word \" wife \" means \" wife \" in the traditional way"], "human": ["the words on the papyrus are too few to be translated exactly .", "the number of texts which indicate that Jesus was married is much too small .", "Jesus ' marriage has never been reflected in the early tradition .", "the word \" wife \" ca n ' t have the same meaning as it had in the long past ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
