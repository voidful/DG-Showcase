Then when he opened the book on his knees , she at once knew who he was . \" Now , if anyone ever has a doubt regarding factorisation , just once , read page number thirteen in your textbook . There would be no more doubt . \" She smiled at the memory , remembering his patient , cool face . She recalled one by one , all the memories of her middle school Math teacher . He was a widower , always looking sad . He looked tailor - made for a librarian , silent as his books , or a romantic poet , but a mathematics teacher was the last guess anyone could make about him . Oh , how they used to make fun of him , play tricks on him and laugh behind his back ! He never laughed but smiled politely at everybody . Sometimes he would make silly mistakes on the blackboard , and then apologize as he erased it out . He always gave in to the girls ' demands of shortening his class . His correction was always careless and merciful , and the middle school girls relied on this fact to pass through the hardest of mathematics exam papers . But she did n ' t remember him for this . Long shiny hair and soulful big eyes . A tall , slim frame . His daughter . They had been best friends and always hung about together . She recalled eagerly all the fun they had in middle school , wild and carefree . . . until his daughter went down with pneumonia . She could never forget the suddenness and the meaninglessness of it , the feeling of emptiness . After that , he looked even sadder . But , life went on .

You taught me in middle school . \" He looked at her for a while . \" I do not even seem to remember any student . \" She knew he was lying . \" I am sorry about your daughter . \" There was a pause in their conversation , and it was filled with all kinds of noises . Then he spoke , looking away . \" I do not need any sympathy . In fact , all my new students think I never had any kids . \"", "questions": "The man refused to admit knowing the woman ' s daughter because", "options": {"model": ["the woman did n ' t like him any longer .", "he did n ' t think his daughter was a good student .", "he never recovered from his daughter ' s death ."], "human": ["her daughter was not clever enough to stand out .", "the name of her daughter was not familiar to him .", "he never recovered from his daughter ' s death ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
