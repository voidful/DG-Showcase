I wanted to say no , but I saw that their shoes were broken and wet . \" Come in and I ' ll make you a cup of hot tea . \" They came in , saying nothing . Their shoes left snow on the floor . I gave them tea and bread to protect them against the cold outside . Then I went back to the kitchen and started my housework again . The silence in the front room surprised me . I looked in . The girl held the empty cup in her hands , looking at it . The boy asked me in a low voice , \" Lady , are you rich ? \" Am I rich ? Oh , no ! I looked at my old things in my room . The girl put her cup back in its saucer carefully . \" Your cups match your saucers . \" They left then , holding their papers against the wind . They had n ' t said thank you . They did n ' t need to . They had done more than that . The blue cups and saucers were simple . But they said that they matched . The potatoes and meat before me , a roof over our hands , my husband with a job - - these things matched , too . I moved the chairs back from the fire and cleaned the living room . The prints of their small shoes were still wet on my floor . I let them be . I wanted them there to remind me how rich I was .", "questions": "What ' s the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["a old man and two old clever old clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever clever", "are you rich ?"], "human": ["Matching Cups and Saucers", "Are You Rich ?"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
