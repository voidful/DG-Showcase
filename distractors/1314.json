{"id": "1314", "article": "You might notice something new in the next few years as you watch Disney programs : Starting in 2015 , there wo n ' t be any candy , sugary cereal or fast - food commercials aimed at kids . The Walt Disney Company has become the first major media company to ban ads for junk food on its TV channels , radio stations and websites . It hopes this will stop kids from making poor food choices . First Lady Michelle Obama called it a \" game changer \" that is sure to send a message to the rest of the children ' s entertainment industry . \" Just a few years ago , if you had told me or any other mom or dad in America that our kids would n ' t see a single ad for junk food while they watched their favorite cartoons on a major TV network , we would n ' t have believed you , \" said the First Lady , who heads a campaign to help stop child obesity . The ban would apply to Disney - owned ABC stations as well as Radio Disney and Disney - owned websites aimed at families with young children . In addition , Disney plans to make changes to its kids ' menus at theme parks and resorts . Fast - food options will be replaced with healthier choices , such as smoothies , apples , vegetables and yogurt . In addition to candy bars and fast - food meals , other foods that do n ' t meet Disney ' s nutritional standards will be banned from the company ' s kid - targeted media . Any cereal with 10 grams or more of sugar per serving will be _ . There will be no ads for full meals of more than 600 calories . Juices with high levels of sugar and foods with too much salt will also be pulled . Leslie Goodman , Disney ' s senior vice - president of Corporate Citizenship , said a company that wants to advertise will need to show that it offers a range of healthy options . Disney is n ' t the only one pushing away unhealthy foods . Last week , New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg suggested a ban on drinks over 16 ounces sold in movie theaters , restaurants and convenience stores in the Big Apple . He says large , sugary drinks are partly to blame for obesity .", "questions": "What Michelle Obama said suggests that while watching cartoons", "options": {"model": ["kids would n ' t watch any tv advertisements", "kids would n ' t like to watch any fast - food advertisements", "many children would like to watch fast - food advertisements on tv", "kids would see a lot of fast - food commercials on tv"], "human": ["kids did n ' t believe what the commercials said", "kids do n ' t enjoy eating candy , sugary cereal or junk food", "kids find pleasure in watching fast - food commercials", "kids would see a lot of fast - food commercials on TV"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
