{"id": "492", "article": "Londoners are great readers . They buy vast numbers of newspapers and magazines and of books - - - especially paperbacks , which are still comparatively cheap in spite of ever - increasing rises in the costs of printing . They still continue to buy \" proper \" books , too , printed on good paper and bound between hard covers . There are many streets in London containing shops which specialize in book - selling . Perhaps the best known of these is Charring Cross Road in the very heart of London . Here bookshops of all sorts and sizes are to be found , from the celebrated one which boasts of being \" the biggest bookshop in the world \" to the tiny , dusty little places which seem to have been left over from Dickens ' time . Some of these shops stock , or will obtain , any kind of book , but many of them specialize in second - hand books , in art books , in foreign books , in books on philosophy , politics or any other of the countless subjects about which books may be written . One shop in this area specializes only in books about ballet ! Although it may be the most convenient place for Londoners to buy books , Charring Cross Road is not the cheapest . For the really cheap second - hand books , the collector must _ , to Farringdon Road , for example , in the East Central district of London . Here there is nothing so impressive as bookshops . The booksellers come along each morning and pour out their sacks of books onto small hand carts . And the collectors , some professionals and some amateurs , have been waiting for them . In places like this they can still , occasionally , pick up for a few pence an old one that may be worth many pounds .", "questions": "\" Londoners are great readers \" means that", "options": {"model": ["londoners read a lot .", "londoners like books .", "londoners sell books in a very low price ."], "human": ["There are a great number of readers in London .", "Londoners are readers who read only great books .", "Londoners read a lot ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
