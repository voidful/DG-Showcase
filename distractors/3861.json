{"id": "3861", "article": "I chose to study in Madrid because I had a desire to learn Spanish . My first impressions of Madrid were incredible . It was before the New Year that I arrived in Madrid for the first time . While traveling to my Spanish friend ' s house in a taxi , I appreciated the buildings along the road which were different from those of my own country . There are an incredible number of restaurants and bars from all over the world . If you are really into sightseeing , I hope you have rechargeable batteries for your digital camera , because one week really is n ' t enough time to see everything here including a number of art , science , and historical museums as well as parks , buildings , and amazing landscapes . What I liked best about life in Madrid was the fact that if you were frustrated with schoolwork and wanted to have some fun , you can easily go out . The nightlife never seems to stop and the people are all very friendly . You can meet people and practice Spanish while having fun at the same time . What I liked least was the fact that many people smoked in the streets . Also , coming from the US , I was used to having a big breakfast every morning , but while living with an actual Spanish family , I was n ' t really satisfied with the food in the morning . I think I have definitely become more independent since I came back from Spain . Living in a big city like Madrid , I found that it is necessary to plan ahead and to make a schedule for future . There is so much to see , not just in the Spanish World , but in the European World as well .", "questions": "What ' s the purpose of the text ?", "options": {"model": ["to describe the author ' s life in madrid .", "to tell us about the author ' s spanish culture in madrid .", "to show the author ' s attitude towards spanish .", "to describe the author ' s experience of the spanish world ."], "human": ["To attract people to tour around Madrid .", "To show how to enjoy Spanish culture .", "To give advice on how to study Spanish .", "To describe the author ' s life in Madrid ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
