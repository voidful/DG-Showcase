{"id": "2664", "article": "That \" Monday morning feeling \" could be a crushing pain in the chest which leaves you sweating and gasping for breath . Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that heart attacks are more common on Monday mornings and doctors blame the stress of returning to work after the weekend break . The risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven , but a six - year study helped by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2 , 600 Germans showed that the average person had a 20 percent higher chance of having a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day . Working Germans are particularly not protected against attack , with a 33 percent higher risk at the beginning of the working week . Non - workers , by comparison , appear to be no more at risk on a Monday than any other day . A study of 11 , 000 Italians proved 8 a . m . on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart , and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day , with fewest heart attacks in both countries . The finding could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks , according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University . \" We know a lot about long - term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we do n ' t know what actually causes heart attacks , so we ca n ' t give clear advice on how to prevent them , \" he said . Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity , and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work . \" When people get up , their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies , \" Willich explained . \" All these things can have an unfavorable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot which will cause a heart attack . \" \" When people return to work after a weekend off , the pace of their life changes . They have a higher workload , more stress , more anger and more physical activities , \" said Willich .", "questions": "If the researchers give us some advice to avoid Monday morning feeling , what might it be ?", "options": {"model": ["give advice on how to prevent heart attacks .", "give advice on how to reduce stress .", "improve working conditions ."], "human": ["Never go to work on Mondays .", "Get up late on Monday mornings .", "Improve working conditions ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
