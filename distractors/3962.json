{"id": "3962", "article": "There are many colors in nature . But do you know if a color has weight ? I think you ' ll say \" no \" . But I am afraid you are wrong . If you do n ' t believe , you may do a small experiment . First , put two objects with the same weight into two boxes . Then cover the box . Third , wrap one box with a red piece of paper , the other with a white piece of paper . OK . Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one . It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier . Why do you think so ? A scientist found that different colors have different weights in a man ' s mind . So he did many tests and at last he got the result . That is to say , every color has its own weight in our mind and their order is the same . The heaviest color is red , then blue , green , yellow and white . The scientist told us that colors also have smell . Can you smell the color ? Of course not . Then why did the scientist say so ? That is because every color stands for a kind of light with a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through sense organs . According to this discovery , scientists say that people accept the colors they like , and refuse the colors they hate . So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colors you like . Or you ' ll be nervous or ill . For example , if you stay in a room with red windows , wallpapers and furniture for two hours , you ' ll feel you have been there for four hours . But if the room is blue , you ' ll feel you have been there for only an hour . Another example , if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room , his temperature will fall . That means our body temperature will change with different colors .", "questions": "It can be known from the text that", "options": {"model": ["different colors have different weight", "colors can affect our mood and health", "colors have different colors in our mind", "different colors have different weight in different ways"], "human": ["colors have order in weight", "colors can change the weight of an object", "people would stay longer in a room with red windows", "colors can affect our mood and health"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
