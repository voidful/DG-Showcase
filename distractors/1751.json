{"id": "1751", "article": "Magic is believed to have begun with the Egyptians , in 1700 BC . A magician named Dedi of Dedsnefu was reported to have performed for the pharaoh , or the king . He was also known to have entertained the slaves who built the pyramids . The \" Cups and Balls \" trick which he was particularly good at is still performed by magicians all over the world today . The ancient Greeks and Romans were also fascinated by the idea of magic . Actually , one of their main interests was the art of deception . This explains why at that time the priests even built magic devices into their temples . These devices made it possible for doors to open by themselves and wine to flow magically out of statues ' mouths . This was done mainly to convince people that the priests were powerful . Magic , however , was not well accepted before the 1800s . Magicians were thought of as freaks and were only allowed to perform in a circus . It was in the 19th century that the magician Robert Houdin came along and changed people ' s views and attitudes about magic . It was also because of Robert Houdin that many magicians were able to add Dr . or MD to their names . Today magicians try hard to find new ways to show their practiced skills . Magic is now entertainment for families all over the world .", "questions": "What did people think of magic before 1800 ?", "options": {"model": ["magic is a good way to perform a circus .", "people could be used as magic in a circus .", "magic is only for people .", "magic could only be performed in a circus ."], "human": ["Magic should be used only in temples .", "Magic was performed by freaks and doctors .", "Magic was the major daily activity for the pharaohs .", "Magic could only be performed in a circus ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
