{"id": "3901", "article": "My daughter comes in with some bags of groceries taking my attention away from the paper . She shouts out , \" Hi daddy ! \" and runs toward the little kitchen . She ' s always running . I ' ve never seen anyone with as much energy as her , except maybe her mom . \" You ' d better not make a mess in there , or your mother will be angry ! \" I call to her . She stops rattling for just a second and says , \" OK , daddy . No problem . \" She ' s a good girl . I look at the side table where there ' s that beautiful black and white photo of her mom that we took last year . Or was it longer ? My daughter is always leaving a seasonal flower in front of it . I do n ' t know why . Maybe because the color1s are nice against the photo and the black frame . She ' s a sweet kid . Finally , she comes out to talk to me and I put down the paper . \" Listen daddy , I ca n ' t stay a while with you tonight because Steve and I are going to a show downtown . I ' ve made some good soup for you and it ' s all ready on the stove . \" \" Now you listen to me , young lady , \" I say , \" you and Steve go and enjoy yourselves . I ' m sure your mom will be home soon and we ' ll eat together . \" She looks doubtful . I pat her head . \" Listen \" , she says , \" you can call Samantha if you need anything . Do you remember Samantha ? \" I nod . Samantha is a good neighbor . She lives below us in the ground floor apartment . My wife and her were always chattering away on the phone or having tea . \" Daddy ? \" She ' s studying my face . \" Samantha ' s number is on the fridge and by the phone . OK ? \" \" OK , \" I say , \" now go on out and have some fun , love . \" The office has really tired me out today . I should make some dinner but I ' ll have a sleep in this chair for now .", "questions": "It can be inferred from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["the author ' s wife had died", "the author ' s father did n ' t like her"], "human": ["the author ' s wife has n ' t come home yet", "the author ' s wife had died"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
