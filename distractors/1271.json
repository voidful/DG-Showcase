{"id": "1271", "article": "Each Indian tribe had a different language . Many Indians never learned any languages except their own . Do you know how Indians from different tribes talked to each other ? They had two ways to talk without sound . One way was by sign language ; another way by signals . Sign language is a way of talking by using signs . Indians used sign language when they met strangers . In this way , they could find out whether the stranger was a friend or an enemy . In Indian sign language , signs were made with the hands . One sign meant \" man \" . Another meant \" horse \" . To tell the time of day when something happened , an Indian pointed to the sky . He showed where the sun had been at the time . Indians usually used signals when they wanted to send messages to someone far away . To make signals , an Indian might use a pony . He might use a blanket . Or he might use smoke , a mirror or fire arrows . To signal that he had seen many animals , an Indian rode his pony in a large circle . Sometimes the Indian gave a signal like this and then went away to hide . This meant that there was danger . The blanket signal was visible from far away . An Indian held the corners of a blanket in his hands . Then he began to swing the blanket from side to side in front of him . An Indian could send many different signals with his blanket . He could also send many signals with a mirror . He usually used the mirror to warn someone of danger . Of course , mirrors could be used only when the sun was shining . At night , Indians used fire arrows for signaling . Now you can see that Indians did n ' t need to learn each other ' s language . They could talk to one another by using signals or sign language .", "questions": "Sign language is", "options": {"model": ["a way to express one ' s ideas by making gestures", "a way to communicate with one ' s friends by using signals", "a way to make signals", "a way of making signals by words"], "human": ["a language only for Indians", "a way of taking by signing on paper", "a secret way of talking to strangers", "a way to express one ' s ideas by making gestures"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
