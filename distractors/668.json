{"id": "668", "article": "Mrs . Goff is a math teacher at Lincoln High School . Mrs . Goff and I met my freshman year . Zach Howe and I were on our way to a baseball game when he said he needed to get his stuff from Mrs . Goff ' s room . I had no idea who she was then , but he said she was great . Well , he was definitely right . Last year , I had a college math class that required me to be in the computer lab , which was located directly behind Mrs . Goff ' s room . When I struggled in the section , I would go to Mrs . Goff ' s and ask for assistance . She told me that I was a little too dependent and not confident enough in my ability . A little confidence , combined with effort , will do wonders for anyone in anything . If you go into something thinking negative thoughts , negative things will happen . Mrs . Goff taught me that it was OK to make a few mistakes . Mistakes are a part of everyone ' s life . She told me that it is how you learn from them that defines your character . A person that learns from his or her mistakes is more likely to be a successful person in life . This year , I have spent a lot of time with Mrs . Goff . She really helps me instill confidence in myself and others around me . The encouragement that she has given me made me realize that I can do the same thing for people . Therefore , she has helped my leadership skills and increased my confidence in being outgoing . Mrs . Goff is a great role model in my life , and I appreciate everything she has done for me . I will never forget the things that she has done for me and the things she has helped me learn and accomplish throughout high school . I hope to be as good a teacher as she and give encouragement that she has for me and all of her students .", "questions": "What can we conclude from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["mr . goff is a great role model for mrs . goff .", "a little confidence may help you achieve what might be impossible .", "mr . goff is a great role model in my life ."], "human": ["Mrs .
