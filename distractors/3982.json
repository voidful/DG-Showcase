Such machines were once used just by universities and big companies , but now , stores with 3D printing services are appearing around the United States . Bryan Jaycox and his wife opened The Build Shop LLC in Los Angeles two years ago . The store is filled with tools like a laser cutter , an industrial sewing machine and 3D printers . The Jaycoxs offer 3D printing classes and services for anyone who is interested . \" I think 3D printing is going to be huge . It ' s going to have a huge effect on society as a whole . \" One of the students in a recent class was KiChong Tran . He plans to open a 3D printing business in Cambodia . 3D printing services are becoming available for American consumers . The UPS Store is a nationwide retailer ( ) that provides shipping , copying and other services . The UPS Store recently put 3D printers in three of its independently - owned stores . Burke Jones owns one of the stores in San Diego . \" The demand has been amazing . It ' s been much more than I would have imagined . \" The UPS Store plans to add 3D printers in three more stores . At The UPS Store , the cost of the object depends on the amount of materials used . The store charges up to $ 95 an hour to design the object with computer software that creates a digital file to guide the printer . Mr . Jaycox predicts that within five years , 3D printing technology could become more popular . But KiChong Tran says even current technology can make a difference in a developing country like Cambodia . \" With 3D printing , you can give them tools ; you put it in their hands so they are responsible more for their own development and they learn skills beyond just learning English and becoming a tour guide or something like that or working at a bank ; you can actually create things that give value to the world . \" He says it ' s not just in Cambodia but anywhere where there is a 3D printer that it can turn a good idea into reality .", "questions": "The purpose of the passage is to", "options": {"model": ["advertise a 3d printing service", "advertise the 3d printing industry", "introduce a new technique - 3d printing"], "human": ["attract consumers to buy 3D printers", "explain the importance of 3D printing", "introduce a new technique - 3D printing"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
