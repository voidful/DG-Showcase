{"id": "1723", "article": "The idea of being able to walk on water has long interested humans greatly . Sadly , biological facts prevent us ever accomplishing such a thing without artificial aid - - we simply weigh too much , and all our mass pushes down through our relatively small feet , resulting in a lot of pressure that makes us sink . However , several types of animals can walk on water . One of the most interesting is the common basilisk . Basilicus , a lizard native to Central and South America . It can run across water for a distance of several meters , avoiding getting wet by rapidly hitting the water ' s surface with its feet . The lizard will take as many as 20 steps per second to keep moving forward . For humans to do this , we ' d need huge feet that we could bring up to our ears in order to create adequate \" hitting . \" But fortunately there is an alternative : cornflour . By adding enough of this common thickening agent to water ( and it does take a lot ) , you can create a \" non - Newtonian \" liquid that does n ' t behave like normal water . Now , if the surface of the water is hit hard enough , particles in the water group together for a moment to make the surface hard . Move quickly enough and put enough force into each step , and you really can walk across the surface of an adequately thick liquid of cornflour . Fun though all this may sound , it ' s still rather messy and better read about in theory than carried out in practice , if you must do it , then keep the water wings handy in case you start to sink - - and take a shower afterward !", "questions": "What is the function of the cornflour according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["to make the water ' s surface soft .", "to create a thick liquid .", "to make the surface hard enough ."], "human": ["To turn the water into solid .", "To enable the water to move rapidly .", "To create a thick liquid ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
