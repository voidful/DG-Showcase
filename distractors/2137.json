{"id": "2137", "article": "The first night in Yosemite had been awfid . I had n ' t been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids . \" Things have n ' t worked out . \" I said to myself . But , like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee , this one was extremely off - key . Things were n ' t bad ; they were good . A hundred yards away was Summit Lake . It was beautiful . We fired up the camp stove and boiled up a cup of coffee . Half an hour later , my 6 - year - old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail , getting ready to hike . We would n ' t make it all the way - - young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path - - but it did n ' t matter . We would see great views spread out below us , the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it . Later , during the hike , I felt stupid about my morning complaints . Everything had been worthwhile . It gave me great satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain . Yes , camping is uncomfortable . But there ' s also something wonderful about being so close to nature . Just as importantly , there ' s something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology - filled comfort zones and forcing them to experience the non - cyber world around them . It ' s a good thing to reconnect every so often with the Great Outdoors .", "questions": "Which of the following is true according to the article ?", "options": {"model": ["the view from the mountain impressed the author ' s daughter .", "the author ' s daughter enjoyed the tour in the park ."], "human": ["The author hiked to the top of the mountain to get a better view .", "The view from the mountain impressed the author ' s daughter ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
