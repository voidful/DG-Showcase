{"id": "140", "article": "Nuclear power ' s danger to health , safety , and even life itself can be summed up in one word : radiation . Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it , partly because it can not be detected by human senses . It ca n ' t be seen or heard , or touched or tasted , even though it may be all around us . There are other things like that . For example , radio waves are all around us but we ca n ' t detect them , sense them , without a radio receiver . Similarly , we ca n ' t sense radioactivity without a radiation detector . But unlike common radio waves , nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things . At very high levels , radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs . But even the lowest levels can do serious damage . There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe . If the radiation does not hit anything important , the damage may not be serious . This is the case when only a few cells are hit , and if they are killed immediately . Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones . But if the few cells are only damaged , and if they reproduce themselves , you may be in trouble . They can grow into cancer . Sometimes this does not show up for many years . This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation . Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred . A person can be irradiated and feel fine , then die for cancer five , ten , or twenty years later as a result . Or a child can be born weak as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents . Radiation can hurt us . We must know the truth .", "questions": "What is not the reason why nuclear radiation has a certain mystery ?", "options": {"model": ["radiation can kill many animals or human beings .", "nuclear radiation can kill a person very easily .", "radiation can hurt a person .", "radiation can hurt those who do n ' t know the truth ."], "human": ["The hurt cells can stay in the body many years and then grow into cancer .", "It can do harm to a person while the victim is n ' t aware the damage has occurred .", "Radiation can seldom kill a person immediately .", "Nuclear radiation can kill a person very easily ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
