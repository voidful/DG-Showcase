{"id": "342", "article": "It ' s a sure sign that summer is over and winter is on the way - - leaves that were once deep green turn red , yellow and bright orange . It happens every autumn . But did you ever wonder why ? The leaves start changing color when the nights start getting longer and the temperature starts getting cooler . Some scientists think that as the number of daylight hours _ the leaves stop making chlorophyll which makes plants green . The reason is that the process of making chlorophyll requires sunlight . But according to horticulture educator Susan Rose from Colorado State University , it turns out leaves do n ' t really change color at all . \" The fall colors are actually there all along , \" she said . \" But they are covered by the green chlorophyll . As the chlorophyll stops being produced , the other colors can shine through . \" The kind of color that the leaves are going to change to is determined by the plant ' s genetic background . In some places , the leaves start changing color in September - - before autumn even officially begins . In other places , they do n ' t change until late October or even November . Some scientists say the leaves have been changing color later than usual in recent years . And they think global warming has something to do with that . In one study , researchers found that the growing season in the Northern Hemisphere was nearly a week longer , on average , in 2008 than it was in 1982 . And a professor from Harvard University found that the leaves , west of Boston , Massachusetts , are changing color about three days later than they used to . However , other scientists disagree with the global warming theory . Susan Rose said the leaves in her part of Colorado are changing \" right on schedule . \" But the leaves in other parts of that state are running a little late . \" The lateness in the mountains may have something to do with the really warm late summer and early fall , \" she said . \" But I ' m afraid that ' s just a guess . \"", "questions": "According to Susan Rose ,", "options": {"model": ["the fall colors are always in leaves", "the leaves in the mountains are changing in different colors", "the leaves do n ' t change color all the year", "the color of the leaves is changeable"], "human": ["leaves make chlorophyll all the seasons", "leaves ' changing color have nothing to with the weather", "leaves begin changing color because they start making chlorophyll", "the fall colors are always in leaves"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
