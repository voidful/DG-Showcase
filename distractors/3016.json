If so , you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness . Many intelligent people still consider happiness equal to fun . The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common . Fun is what we experience during an act . Happiness is what we experience after an act . It is a deeper , more lasting emotion . Going to an amusement park or ball game , watching a movie or television , are fun activities that help us relax , temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh . But they do not bring happiness , because their positive effects end when the fun ends . I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play , it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun . These rich , beautiful people have constant access to glamorous parties , fancy cars , expensive homes , everything that brings \" happiness \" . But in memoir after memoir , famous people expose the unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun - - depression , alcoholism , drug addiction , broken marriages , troubled children and extreme loneliness . Ask an unmarried man why he refuses to get married even though he finds dating to be less and less satisfying . If he ' s honest , he will tell you that he is afraid of making a commitment . For commitment is in fact quite painful . The single life is filled with fun , adventure and excitement . Marriage has such moments , but they are not its most distinguishing features . Similarly , couples that choose not to have children are deciding in favor of painless fun over painful happiness . They can dine out whenever they want and sleep as late as they want . Couples with babies are lucky to get a whole night ' s sleep or a three - day vacation . I do n ' t know any parent who would choose the word fun to describe raising children . The way people stick to the belief that a fun - filled , pain - free life equals happiness actually reduces their chances of ever achieving real happiness . If fun and pleasure are equal to happiness , then pain must be equal to unhappiness . As a result , they fear the pain unavoidably brought by such things as marriage , raising children , professional achievement , religious commitment and self - improvement . But , in fact , the opposite is true .
