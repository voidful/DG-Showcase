{"id": "5359", "article": "Birds Can \" Read \" Human Gaze We all know that people sometimes change their behavior when someone is looking their way . Now , a new study reported online on April 2nd in Current Biology shows that jackdaws - - birds related to crows with eyes that appear similar to human eyes - - can do the same . \" Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye ' s role in visual perception , or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented , \" said Auguste von Bayern , formerly of the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Oxford . When presented with a preferred food , hand - raised jackdaws took significantly longer to get the reward when a person was directing his eyes towards the food than when he was looking away , according to the research team led by Nathan Emery of the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London . The birds hesitated only when the person was unfamiliar and thus potentially threatening . In addition , the birds were able to interpret human communicative gestures , such as gaze alternation and pointing , to help them find hidden food , they found . The birds were unsuccessful in using unmoving cues , including eye gaze or head orientation . Unlike most birds , jackdaws ' eyes have a dark pupil surrounded by a silvery white iris . The researchers said they believe jackdaws are probably sensitive to human eyes because , as in humans , eyes are an important means of communication for them . The hand - raised birds examined in the study may be even better than wild jackdaws at attending to human gaze and responding to the gestures of the people who have raised them . The findings are particularly notable given that most other species investigated so far , including our closest s the chimpanzee and \" man ' s best friend , \" the dog , are not particularly sensitive to eye orientation and eye gaze , von Bayern said . Rather , she continued , chimps and dogs seem to rely on other cues such as head or body orientation in determining the looking direction of others . The results suggest that birds may deserve more respect for their mental abilities . \" We may have understated the psychological world of birds , \" von Bayern said . \" Jackdaws , among many other birds , form pair ties for life and need to have much in common", "questions": "What does the research finding suggest ?", "options": {"model": ["jackdaws are more sensitive to human eyes .", "we may have understated jackdaws ' mental abilities .", "we may have blind eyes in the wild ."], "human": ["Not all jackdaws are good at attending to human gaze .", "We know embarrassingly less about birds than we assume .", "We may have understated jackdaws ' mental abilities ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
