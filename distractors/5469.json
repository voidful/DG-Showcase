{"id": "5469", "article": "This year , some twenty - three hundred teenagers from all over the world will spend about ten months in their US homes . They will attend US schools , meet US teenagers , and form impressions of the real America . At the same time , about thirteen hundred American teenagers will go to other countries to learn new languages and gain a new understanding of the rest of the world . Here is a two - way students exchange in action . Fred , nineteen , spent last year in Germany with George ' s family . In turn , George ' s son Mike spent a year in Fred ' s home in America . Fred knew little German when he arrived , but after two months ' study , the language began to come to him . School was completely different from what he had expected - - - much harder . Students rose respectfully when a teacher entered the room . They took fourteen subjects instead of the six that are usual in the United States . There were almost no extracurricular activities . Family life , too , was different . The father ' s word was law , and all activities were around the family rather than the individual . Fred found the food too simple at first . Also , he missed having a car . ' Back home , you pick up some friends in a car and go out and have a good time . In Germany , you walk , but you soon learn to like it . ' At the same time , in America , Mike , a friendly German boy , was also forming his idea . ' I suppose I should criticize American schools , ' he said . ' It is too easy by our level . But I have to say that I like it very much . In Germany we do nothing but study . Here we take part in many activities . There ought to be some middle ground between the two .
