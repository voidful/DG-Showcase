Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them . It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading . Douglas insists that \" reading can not be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible . \" Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes . They differ in kind and function . The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read . Teaching is also a public activity . It can be seen and observed . Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language . Almost all of it is private , for learning is an occupation of the mind , and that process is not open to public scrutiny . If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable , what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest for knowledge ? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions . \" Make learning to read easy , which means making reading a meaningful , enjoyable and frequent experience for children . \" When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are , and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately , then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated .
