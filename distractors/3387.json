In the goldfields we need strong trousers that do n ' t wear out , \" one young miner advised Strauss . So Levi Strauss took some of his denim to the nearest tailor and had him make the miner a pair of trousers . The miner was so pleased that he told other miners about the wonderful newcomer , Levi , and soon Levi Strauss had to open a shop , producing enough trousers for the miners . The miners wanted trousers that were comfortable to ride in and were low cut so that they could bend over easily to pick up the gold from under their feet . Besides they wanted the trousers to have big useful pockets . One miner complained that the gold in his pockets kept tearing them . So Levi put metal corners in the pockets to make them stronger .
