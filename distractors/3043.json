{"id": "3043", "article": "The water level of oceans rises and falls alternately twice a day . This movement of water is called the tide . Tides are causer by the pull of the sun and the moon on the earth ' s surface ; since the moon is closer , it affects the tides more than the sun . When the moon is directly overhead , it actually pulls on the water that is below it . This causes the water level to rise because the water is pulled away from the earth . As the moon disappears over the horizon , the pull lessens and the water level settles back towards the ocean bottom . When the water reaches its highest level , we have high tide . And when the water comes to its lowest level , we have low tide from its lowest point , the water rises gradually for about six hours until it reaches high tide . Then it begins to fall continuously for about six hours until it reaches low tide . Then the cycle begins again .", "questions": "Water level reaches its low point when", "options": {"model": ["the sun goes around the moon from its bottom", "the moon moves far away"], "human": ["the moon ' s effect is indirect", "the moon moves far away"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
