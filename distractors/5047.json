{"id": "5047", "article": "Many people do not like to stay at home on holidays . They want to go out to see something different or do something interesting . So people from the country come to the city and people from the city go to the country for holidays . During the holidays trains , buses and planes are all very busy . It is very hard to buy train tickets or air tickets . Many people take cars or buses for traveling . Last May Day my family went to the country by car for our holiday . There was too much traffic on the road , so we had to move very slowly . It took us about an hour to get out of the town . After some time , we came to a hill . It was green and beautiful . We thought this was a good place for a picnic , so we stopped and took the food , fruit and drinks out of the car . We sat down and began to eat . Suddenly a strong wind blew and soon it started to rain . We had to run back to our car and have our picnic in the car . Then we drove back home .
