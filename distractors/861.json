{"id": "861", "article": "A grave of a man dating back to around 2300 BC was found by archaeologists in England On May 3 , 2002 . Buried with him were the tools of a hunter or warrior . There was a bone pin that may have been from a piece of clothing such as a leather coat . He carried a copper knife on his breast . The most amazing find was two gold earrings . That would have made him a man of distinction . Only a few centimeters from his head were two pots made of clay , tools and materials to make arrows , a bow and a dozen arrows for hunting and a second , smaller copper knife . Next to them lay a cushion stone , upon which the man could work metal . His grave is the richest of any found from that period , because this man was buried with two gold earrings which are the oldest gold ever found in Britain ( dated to 2470 BC ) . Besides , he was buried three miles from Stonehenge . Archaeologists tend to believe he was a member of a powerful class who might have organized the construction of Stonehenge . Stonehenge was begun around 3000 BC . In about 2300 BC the huge stone circles were built . The biggest stone weighed approximately 20 tons . But the smaller blue stones , still weighing 4 tons on average , came from west Wales . It is not yet known how these were conveyed over a distance of 380 km . It is also a mystery how early man was able to construct Stonehenge without the use of modern construction machines and lorries . He is an example of people who brought culture and new techniques from the European mainland to Britain . In terms of technical development people were going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age and then to the Iron Age .", "questions": "Why is the man buried in the grave called the \" king of Stonehenge \" ?", "options": {"model": ["because the stone was made of stones , tools and objects .", "because he was a member of a powerful class .", "all of the above .", "because he is the richest man of any found ."], "human": ["He was buried three miles from Stonehenge .", "He had the oldest gold ever found in Britain .", "He might be a member of a powerful class who might have organized the construction of Stonehenge .", "All of the above ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
