{"id": "983", "article": "The smell of fresh air is becoming something of a distant memory , thanks to our increasing use of fragrance . From air fresheners to scented candles , we live in a world of scent . Recent figures show seven in ten people use air fresheners or scented candles to keep our homes smelling sweet . Yet recent records suggest that perfumed products could affect our health , causing problems including allergies , headaches and asthma . One leading expert believes nearly a third of people suffer health effects from being exposed to scents . A major problem is so - called \" contact \" allergy - - where perfumes and scented products cause eczema when they come into contact with the skin . About one in 20 is thought to be affected by fragrance allergy . \" Often it may not be immediately obvious that you have developed a fragrance allergy , \" says Dr . Baron . \" You do n ' t react immediately . Gradually , as you are exposed more and more , the body increases its reaction , until it becomes noticeable to you . \" People with pre - existing eczema are particularly vulnerable . \" The eczema worsens in areas in contact with perfumes , \" says Dr . Baron . \" But even those without allergies can be at risk of fragrance allergy . \" You can become suddenly allergic to perfumes and personal care products that you have been using for years . \" Even if you know which fragrance causes a problem , it can be difficult to avoid , as most personal care products - soap , shampoo , sun cream and washing powder - - contain fragrances , \" says Dr . Baron . And strong scents can also cause headaches . Fragrances activate the nose ' s nerve cells , stimulating the nerve system associated with head pain . To minimize risk , sufferers are advised to minimize the contact . \" Fragrance suggest cleanliness - yet people are smelling a potentially dangerous chemical mixture , \" says Anne Steinemann , professor of the University of Washington . \" We often use them to mask one problem - as with air fresheners - but create a greater one - adding poisonous chemicals to the air . \"", "questions": "What is the text mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["the health problems caused by fragrance", "the ways to use breath to protect our homes smells sweet", "the advantages and disadvantages of getting a fagnce"], "human": ["The world trend of using fragrance .", "The ways of removing allergy .", "The health problems caused by fragrance"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
