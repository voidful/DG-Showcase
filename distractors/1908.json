{"id": "1908", "article": "Age has its special advantages inprefix = st1 / America . And one of the more impressive of them is the senior citizen discount . Anyone who has reached a certain age - - in some cases as low as 55 - - is automatically entitled to plenty of price reductions at nearly every level of commercial life . Eligibility is determined not by one ' s need but by the date on one ' s birth certificate . Practically the discounts have become a routine part of many businesses - - as common as color1 televisions in motel rooms and free coffee on airliners . People with array hair often are given the discounts without even asking for them ; yet , millions of Americans above age 60 are healthy and solvent . Businesses that would never dare offer discounts to college students or anyone under 30 freely offer them to older Americans . The practice is acceptable because of the widespread belief that \" elderly \" and \" needy \" are synonymous . Perhaps that once was true , but today , to be sure , there is economic variety within the elderly , and most of them are n ' t poor . It is impossible to determine the effect of the discounts on individual companies . For many firms , they are a stimulus to income . But in other cases the discounts are given at the expense , directly or indirectly , of younger Americans . Moreover , they directly annoy some politicians and scholars who consider it a coming conflict between the generations . Generational tensions are being fueled by continuing debate over Social Security benefits , which mostly involves a transfer of resources from the young to the old . Employment is another point . Supported by laws and court decisions , more and more older Americans are refusing the retirement dinner in favor of staying on the job - - thereby lessening employment and promotion opportunities for younger workers . Far from a kind of charity they once were , senior citizen discounts have become a powerful economic privilege to a group with millions of members who do n ' t need them . It no longer makes sense to treat the elderly as a single group whose economic needs deserve priority over those of others . Senior citizen discounts only enrich the myth that older people ca n ' t take care of themselves and need special treatment ; and they threaten the creation of a new myth", "questions": "What does the author mainly argue in the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["young people should n ' t take care of themselves as well as adults do", "senior citizen discounts may well be a type of age discrimination", "young people should take care of themselves and need special treatment", "it ' s necessary for older americans to respect the elderly"], "human": ["Senior citizens should fight hard against age discrimination", "The elderly are selfish and taking senior discounts for granted", "Discounts should be given to the economics needs of senior citizens", "Senior citizen discounts may well be a type of age discrimination"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
