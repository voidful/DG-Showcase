I heard it many times as a child , whenever my family visited Aunt Bettie in the old house in Berryville , Virginia . Bettie Van Metre had good reason to hate the Civil War . Her brother was killed at Gettysburg , and her husband , James , a Confederate officer , was taken prisoner and sent to an unknown prison camp somewhere . One day in late September , Dick came to Bettie reporting that he had found a wounded Union soldier in a farmhouse half a mile away from the Van Metre home . When talking about her first sight of the man in the blood - spotted blue uniform , she always used the same words . _ She went out into the cool air , trying not to be sick at the thought of that smashed right hand , that missing left leg .

She knew that she should report the presence of this Union officer to the Confederate army , but she would n ' t . This is how she explained it : \" I kept wondering if he had a wife somewhere , hoping , and not knowing - - just as I was . It seemed to me that the only thing that mattered was to get her husband back to her . \" Slowly , patiently , skillfully , Aunt Bettie fanned the spark of life in Henry Bedell .
