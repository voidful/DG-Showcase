{"id": "160", "article": "Most Chinese people do n ' t understand why some westerners do n ' t eat meat . In China , to eat meat is a sign of wealth . If a westerner does n ' t take a bite of their Peking duck , there is something wrong . But many people in Europe and America choose not to eat meat or fish - - they are known as vegetarians . In the US alone there are 12 million vegetarians and 19 , 000 more people stop eating meat every week . People often become vegetarians in order to lose weight or eat more healthily . A lot of research has shown that vegetarian diets are healthier than the average western diet . Fried chicken may be delicious to eat , but all that extra fat can damage your heart . There are many other reasons for \" turning veggie \" . It could be that you can not afford to buy meat . Or maybe you just do n ' t like the taste of it . A large number of vegetarians choose to give up meat because they believe it is cruel to kill animals for food . They believe many animals are not allowed to live in comfort and , when they are killed , it is carried out in a very painful way . While some vegetarians are happy not to eat animals , others take it one step further and refuse to eat any animal product . They are known as vegans and will not eat cheese , yoghurt and eggs , or drink milk . Neither will they wear clothes or shoes made from animal skin , such as leather . They say that if it is wrong to kill an animal for food , it is worse to kill it for clothing . But there are some groups that go even further . Fruitarians believe it is wrong to kill any living plant or animal . Besides refusing to eat meat , they will only eat fruit and vegetables that have not been killed when harvested . This means they can not take an apple from a tree : they must wait until the apple falls to the ground . Only then can it be considered dead .", "questions": "What is the main idea of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["food and meat", "the relationship between meat and food", "meat and health"], "human": ["Meat is harmful to health", "Vegetarian diets are popular", "Meat and health"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
