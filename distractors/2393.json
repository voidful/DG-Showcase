You do n ' t even have to look at the screen to know your payment information was successfully sent , \" Apple says on its official website . Apple said that each transaction would be authorized with a one - time , unique number , creating a security code that it said is more secure than the one on the back of your credit card because cashiers wo n ' t see your name , card number or security code .
