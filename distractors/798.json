{"id": "798", "article": "In cities with rent control , the city government sets the maximum rent that a landlord can charge for an apartment . Supporters of rent control argue that it protects people who are living in apartment . Their rent can not increase ; therefore , they are not in danger of losing their homes . However , the critics say that after a long time , rent control may have negative effects . Landlords know that they can not increase their profits . Therefore , they invest in other businesses where they can increase their profits . They do not invest in new buildings which would also be rent - controlled . As a result , new apartments are not built . Many people who need apartments can not find any . According to the critics , the end result of rent control is a shortage of apartments in the city . Some experts argue that the minimum wage law can cause problems in the same way . The federal government sets the minimum that an employer must pay workers . The minimum helps people who generally look for unskilled , low - paying jobs . However , if the minimum is high , employers may hire fewer workers . They will replace workers with machinery . Therefore , other things being equal , the number of workers that employers want decreases . Thus , critics hold the opinion that an increase in the minimum wage may cause unemployment . Some poor people may find themselves without jobs instead of with jobs at the minimum wage . Supporters of the minimum wage say that it helps people keep their dignity . Because of the law , workers can not sell their services for less than the minimum . Furthermore , employers can not force workers to accept jobs at unfair wages . Economic theory predicts the results of economic decision , such as decisions about farm production , rent control , and the minimum wage . The predictions may be corrected only if \" other things are equal \" . Economists do not agree on some of the predictions . They also do not agree on the value of different decisions . Some economists support a particular decision while others criticize it . Economists do agree , however , that there are no simple answers to economic questions .", "questions": "We can safely say that rent control", "options": {"model": ["will probably bring inactive effects in the long run .", "should n ' t be taxed ."], "human": ["will always benefit those who rent apartments .", "will probably bring inactive effects in the long run ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
