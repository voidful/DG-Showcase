And she does n ' t look a day over fifty . \" He has been careful not to use the word \" old \" . In a society where youth is so admired , old age is often seen as something sad , something to fight against . Americans prefer not to say \" old \" people .

At the same time , improved medical care means that people are living longer . This change in the age of Americans is going to have serious results . For one thing , medical costs are rising .
