{"id": "5650", "article": "We experience different forms of the Sun ' s energy every day . We can see its light and feel its warmth . The Sun is the major source of energy for our planet . It causes the evaporation of water from the oceans and lakes . Sunlight also provides the energy used by green plants to make their own food . These green plants then provide food for all organisms on the Earth . Much of the energy that comes from the Sun never reaches the Earth ' s surface . It is either reflected or absorbed by the gases in the upper atmosphere . Of the energy that reaches the lower atmosphere , 30 % is reflected by clouds or the Earth ' s surface . The remaining 70 % warms the surface of the planet , causes water to evaporate , and provides energy for the water cycle and weather . Only a tiny part , approximately 0 . 023 % , is actually used by green plants to produce food . Many gases found in the atmosphere actually reflect heat energy escaping from the Earth ' s surface back to the Earth . These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse in that they allow energy from the Sun to enter but prevent energy from leaving . They are therefore called greenhouse gases . When sunlight strikes an object , some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected . The amount reflected depends on the surface . For example , you ' ve probably noticed how bright snow is when sunlight falls on it . Snow reflects most of the energy from the Sun , so it contributes to the low temperatures of winter . Dark - coloured surfaces , such as dark soil or forest , absorb more energy and help warm the surrounding air .", "questions": "According to the passage , the root ( ) cause for weather changes on the Earth is", "options": {"model": ["energy from the sun", "light from the sun", "energy from the sun ' s surface", "heat from the sun"], "human": ["the atmosphere surrounding the Earth", "water from oceans and lakes", "greenhouse gases in the sky", "energy from the Sun"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
