{"id": "1155", "article": "Can you become a creative person ? Can you learn to come up with great ideas or learn to create new things ? The answer is yes . The first step to becoming creative is to remove the words \" I am not creative \" from your vocabulary . Seriously , do not say them or do not say them even inside your head . Now you need to start looking what other people are doing . The more you see what they are doing , the more you can get a feel for how they think , and how they come up with creative ideas . Find a way or a place where you feel totally relaxed . This is important so you can let your mind come up with ideas . Write them down as you get them . For me a relaxing place is outside in nature where it is quiet and sunny , or when I take a long drive in my car by myself . The last step is to write down a few ideas every day . Repeat the process of reading and observing what similar people are doing and how they are being creative , finding a relaxing place to write down your thoughts , and writing down a few ideas every day until you start seeing this kind of results you are happy with . It may take a few weeks to a few months , but this is the training process you need to put your mind through to become creative . Remember , looking at things from different angle can also make a big difference to creativity . Question the way that everyone else is doing something using the same method and see if being different and doing it another way will produce something cool .", "questions": "It can be inferred that", "options": {"model": ["people should try different things to become more creative", "creativity can be gained through practice", "creativity can be developed through learning"], "human": ["not everyone can be creative", "it is a piece of cake to be creative", "creativity can be gained through practice"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
