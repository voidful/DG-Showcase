{"id": "1006", "article": "From bankers to factory staff , employees in the West face a cold _ of losing their jobs as a global recession starts to bite .

Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times , which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports . The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff , but build up a more loyal and devoted group . \" In the Confucian mindset , the right thing to do is to share the burden , which is the sense of collective responsibility . While in the West , it ' s more about individual survival , \" said Michael Benoliel , associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University ( SMU ) . In contrast , local Western companies from General Motors to Goldman Sachs plan to lay off workers by the thousand , but at the Asian units of Western multinationals or western units of Asian groups , job cuts will probably be less severe . Japan ' s jobless rate was 4 percent in September , up from 3 . 8 percent in January , while Hong Kong ' s was flat at 3 . 4 percent . But US unemployment is expected to have jumped to 6 . 3 percent last month from below 5 percent in January . Experts say that while there are noticeable differences in labor practices in East and West , the gap will narrow as more firms become more multinational and competition forces firms to adopt the best practices of rivals from abroad .", "questions": "The passage mainly tells us", "options": {"model": ["the different labor solutions of asian and western in global recession", "the different labor practices in east and west in different countries", "the problems of asia and asia in global unemployment"], "human": ["the cultural differences between Eastern and Western world at present", "the ways to cut down the cost of the companies in economic downturn", "the different labor solutions of Asian and Western in global recession"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
