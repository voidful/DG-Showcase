People spend part of their spare time watching television , and much of what they learn comes from it . What we see on TV - movies , news shows , sports shows , advertisements and so on have increased our knowledge and have changed the way we learn about the world today . However , not everything on TV is true . Most of the viewers are children . Television sometimes is like a baby - sitter . It spends more time with children than parents do . But it keeps them in the living room away from healthy outdoor activities . They spend less time playing soccer or walking in the park or playing games in the yard . Of course , there are some programs on TV that are good for children . But there are also some shows which are bad . Children should not watch unhealthy shows . Maybe we ca n ' t change what is on TV , but we can choose what we watch .
