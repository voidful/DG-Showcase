{"id": "2634", "article": "After an earthquake or any similar disaster , parents and teachers need to help children overcome the effects of this frightening and sometimes devastating ( ) experience . Psychologists say that if children go through a disturbing event before the age of ten , they are three times as likely to suffer psychological problems as teenagers . After a disaster children may become easily upset , shy , aggressive , or afraid of wind , rain , noises , or darkness . They may have trouble letting go of their parents and resist going to school or daycare . Some children may even feel guilty thinking that they somehow caused the disaster through their bad behavior . Because of such common reactions , parents and others should begin as soon after the event as possible helping these children . Some suggestions include talking to the children about what happened , letting the children express their own feelings , spending extra time with them doing activities together and reassuring them that you love them and wo n ' t leave them . For some children expressing themselves through drawing pictures or writing can be useful . Do everything possible to help children get back to a normal routine ; however , do n ' t be afraid to \" spoil \" these children for a while after the disaster . Let them have extra privileges and more attention than usual . Encourage the children to grieve after a loss . It should be OK for them to cry . Caring families and friends can do much to heal children victims of disasters .", "questions": "This passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["why parents and teachers need to help children overcome the effects of a disaster", "how to help parents and teachers to solve the children ' s problems", "how to help traumatized children to get over"], "human": ["the bad effects disasters bring to children", "the psychological problems children before ten are likely to suffer", "how to help traumatized children to get over"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
