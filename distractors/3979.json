A year - long study , recently published in the Sciences , found that elementary school children who were exposed to more green space within or directly outside their school showed improved learning and memory . The findings reinforce that of a recent six - year study on 905 Massachusetts public elementary schools , which found that students in schools that had more \" greenness \" in their surroundings reported higher scores on standardized testing in English and math . \" There is an expanding body of scientific evidence linking the human experience in the natural world to better physical and mental health and improved cognitive abilities , \" journalist Richard Louv , co - founder of the Children & Nature Network , said in an email to The Huffington Post . \" An increasing number of homeschoolers , nature preschools , independent primary and secondary schools , and forward - thinking public schools are incorporating nature experience into learning . \" The new study was conducted on more than 2 , 500 children in second , third and fourth grade at 36 primary schools in Barcelona , Spain . Researchers found that the students who attended schools with more green space showed a 5 percent improvement in the short - term memory that ' s critical for reasoning , learning and comprehension . But their inattentiveness decreased slightly . Spending time outside could have a number of benefits for children beyond improved memory and attention . Another recent study found that adventurous outdoor play such as climbing , rough and tumble play , and exploring alone improves children ' s physical health while also help them develop creativity and social skills greatly . Some schools are starting to take notice , creating more space for children to enjoy being in nature , including community gardens , outdoor playgrounds and small parks .", "questions": "According to the passage , what can we know about Richard Louv ?", "options": {"model": ["he is one of the founders of the children & nature network .", "he is the first to study in the children & nature network .", "he is a founder of the children & nature network ."], "human": ["He discourages students from getting close to nature to gain experience .", "He conducted the study on 905 Massachusetts public elementary schools .", "He is one of the founders of the Children & Nature Network ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
