He thought about what he could do . There was no point asking his parents , for he knew they had no extra money . There was only one way to get money , and that was to earn it . He would have to find a job . He decided to ask Mr Clay for advice . \" Well , you can start right here , \" said Mr Clay . \" You see , my windows need cleaning and my car needs washing . \" That was the beginning of James ' part - time job . For the next three months he worked every day after finishing his homework . He took dogs for walks , cleared out cupboards and mended books . The day finally came when James counted his money and found $ 94 . 32 . He wasted no time and went down to the shop to pick up the bicycle he wanted . He rode home proudly , looking forward to showing his new bicycle to his friends .
