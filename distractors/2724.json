{"id": "2724", "article": "\" Wanna buy a body ? \" That was the opening line of more than a few phone calls I got from self - employed photographers when I was a photo editor at U . S . News . Like many in the mainstream press , I wanted to separate the world of photographers into \" them \" , who trade in pictures of bodies or run after famous people like Princess Diana , and \" us \" , the serious newspeople . But after 16 years in that role , I came to wonder whether the two worlds were easily distinguishable . Working in the reputable world of journalism , I told photographers to cover other people ' s difficult life situations . I justified marching into moments of sadness , under the appearance of the reader ' s right to know . I worked with professionals talking their way into situations or shooting from behind police lines . And I was n ' t alone . In any American town , after a car crash or some other horrible incident when ordinary people are hurt or killed , you rarely see photographers pushing past rescue workers to take photos of the blood and injuries . But you are likely to see local newspaper and television photographers on the scene - and fast . . . How can we justify doing this ? Journalists are taught to separate , doing the job from worrying about the consequences of publishing what they record . Repeatedly , they are reminded of a news - business saying : Leave your conscience in the office , A victim may lie bleeding , unconscious , or dead . Your job is to record the image . You ' re a photographer , not an emergency medical worker . You put away your feelings and document the scene . But catastrophic events often bring out the worst in photographers and photo editors . In the first minutes and hours after a disaster occurs , photo agencies buy pictures . They rush to obtain the rights to be the only one to own these shocking images and death is usually the subject . Often , an agency buys a picture from a local newspaper or an amateur photographer and puts it up for bid by major magazines . The most sought - after special pictures command tens of thousands of dollars through bidding contests . I worked on all those stories and many like them . When they happen , you move quickly : buying , dealing , trying to beat the agencies to the pictures . Now , many people believe journalists are the hypocrites who need to be brought down , and it ' s our pictures that most anger others .
