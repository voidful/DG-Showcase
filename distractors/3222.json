{"id": "3222", "article": "Effective environmental protection laws and other measures have led to the improvement of water quality in Tai Hu lake in prefix = st1 / JiangsuProvince . The news was announced by officials from the provincial environmental protection bureau , which has just conducted an inspection of the lake area . By the end of September , about 80 per cent of industrial pollutants met required standards and the lake is expected to be cleaner by the end of the year , officials said . According to targets set by the State Environmental Protection Administration , all polluting enterprises must meet set standards by the end of this year or they will be shut down . The Taihu Lake area , which surrounds the cities of Suzhou , Wuxiand Changshou , is one of the most economically developed areas in the country and has long enjoyed a reputation as the \" land of fish and rice \" However , the quality of water in the lake has been deteriorating at an alarmingly rate in recent years , which has caused concern from the government and local people . Pollution is so high mainly because people do not have enough environmental awareness and have put economic benefits ahead of their surroundings . Economic development in the area has been rapid with hundreds of factories being built . But officials say most of these do not have the anti - pollution equipment or measures they should have . Because of the lack of waste treatment facilities , wasted water and other rubbish from residential areas in nearby towns and villages flow into rivers which are connected to TaihuLake . This also contributed to the lake ' s pollution . Realizing the seriousness of the situation , the provincial and local governments began to tackle the problem . Experts were invited to offer suggestions and laws and regulations were issued . All newly built factories and enterprises in the lake area were required to install necessary anti - pollution facilities before they can go into operation . Also , some wasted water treatment works will be built in the three cities .", "questions": "The reason why the pollution became so serious here is that", "options": {"model": ["the people did not have enough environmental awareness", "the people in the area did n ' t have enough environmental awareness", "the factories thought the economy was the first", "the people did not have enough environmental awareness and have put economic benefits ahead of their surroundings"], "human": ["the people here did n ' t know how to deal with the pollution", "the local governments did n ' t know the situation at all", "the factories had no the technology to control the pollution .", "the factories thought the economy was the first"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
