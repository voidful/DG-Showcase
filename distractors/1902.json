{"id": "1902", "article": "Another thing an astronaut has to learn about is eating in space . Food is weightless , just as men are . Food for space has to be packed in special ways . Some of it goes into tubes that a man can squeeze into his mouth . Bite - sized cookies are packed in plastic . There is a good reason for covering each bite . The plastic keeps pieces of food from traveling in the spaceship . On the earth very small pieces of food would simply fall to the floor . But gravity does n ' t pull them to the floor when they are out of the plastic in a spaceship . They move here and there and can get into a man ' s eyes or into the spaceship ' s instruments . If any of the instruments is blocked , the astronauts may have trouble getting safely home . As astronauts travel on longer space trips , they must take time to sleep . An astronaut can fit himself to his seat with a kind of seat belt . Or , if he wants to , he can sleep in a sleeping bag which is fixed in place under his seat . But be careful he must put his hands under the belt when he goes to sleep . This is because he is really afraid that he might touch one of controls that is n ' t supposed to be touched until later .", "questions": "In a spaceship , astronauts can", "options": {"model": ["not litter small things or it will make trouble .", "use their seat belts"], "human": ["control the spaceship when they are sleeping .", "not litter small things or it will make trouble ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
