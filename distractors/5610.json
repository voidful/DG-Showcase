{"id": "5610", "article": "The percentage of districts that require elementary schools to teach physical education increased , to 93 % last year from 83 % in 2000 . But just 4 % of elementary schools , 8 % of middle schools and 2 % of high schools provided physical education each school day , as is recommended by the disease control agency . One - fifth of schools did not require physical education at all . In 2004 , Congress passed a law requiring each school district to develop a \" wellness policy \" to promote the students ' health by setting goals for nutrition education and physical activity . Those policies are just now taking effect , and some school administrators predict that the next survey will show more marked improvements . Some schools have set out to place health education on the same requirement with academics . In Los Angeles County , Sepulveda Middle School has banned soft drinks and eliminated unhealthy snacks from the school store . Salad , fruit and yogurt are always available in the cafeteria , said Patricia J . Pelletier , the principal . Nearly an hour of physical education is required daily , the school offers after - hours training in distance running , and it has started a class on healthy cooking for parents . \" If kids are healthy and have healthy lifestyles , they ' re going to be better students , \" Ms Pelletier said . \" They ' re going to be in school , and they ' re going to be connected with the teachers in a better way . \" The survey found that nearly two - thirds of schools prohibited tobacco use at all places , including at off - campus functions , up from 46 % in 2000 . Another finding was that the proportion of states that require middle schools to teach human sexuality grew , to 59 % from 46 % . The report found a variety of indications of healthier cooking in school cafeterias . 55 % reported that they had removed the skin from poultry before cooking , up from 40 % , and 46 % now use low - fat cheeses , up from 31 % . But 12 % of elementary schools , 19 % of middle schools and 24 % of high schools offer students brand - name fast food from businesses like Pizza Hut and Taco Bell .", "questions": "What is the best title for this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["improve students ' physical health by developing their nutrition education", "new changes in physical education", "more and more schools require physical education"], "human": ["Only a little percentage of students are taught physical education", "Healthy habits should be taught in schools", "Improve students ' physical health by developing their nutrition education"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
