{"id": "3439", "article": "Preface to the fourth edition A practical English Grammar is intended for intermediate and post - intermediate students . We hope that more advanced learners and teachers will also find it useful . The book is a comprehensive survey of structures and forms , written in clear modern English and illustrated with numerous examples . Areas of particular difficulty have been given special attention . Differences between conversational usage and strict grammatical forms are shown but the emphasis is on conversational forms . 1 . Explanation and examples have been brought up to date . 2 . There is now more information on countable and uncountable nouns , attributive and predicative adjectives , adverbs of places , sentence adverbs , cleft sentences , prepositions , conjunctives , modal verbs , perfect tenses , infinitive constructions , the passive , purpose clauses and nouns . In the fourth edition the main changes are as follows . 3 . Some material has been rearranged to make comparisons easier . For example , parts of chapters on can , may , must etc . are now grouped by functions ; verbs of liking and preference have a chapter to themselves ; suggestions and invitations have joined the chapter on commands , requests and advice . 4 . The contents list now summaries every edition heading , and there is a new index containing many more entries references . In this edition the sign \" ~ \" is frequently used to show a change of speaker in examples of dialogue . Note also that although the sign \" = \" sometimes connects two words or expressions with the same meaning , it is often used more freely , e . g . to indicate a transformation from active to passive or direct to indirect speech . We wish to thank all at Oxford University Press who have assisted in the preparation of the fourth edition . We would also like to thank Professor Egawa of Nihon University , Japan , Professor Rene Dirven of Duisburg University , West Germany and other colleagues for their friendly and helpful suggestions .
