{"id": "528", "article": "A used book or nearly - new kitchen gadget may not be at the top of every Christmas wish list , but hard economic times coupled with a new green awareness are changing attitudes about gift - giving in France . French holiday shoppers are choosing larger numbers for \" green \" gifting this Christmas , studies show . About 30 percent of French consumers will give second - hand items as gifts to stretch out their tight budgets but also to do their little bit for recycling , according to a study by international consulting firm Deloitte . The survey of Christmas consumer behaviors in 18 European countries found the French were more than twice as likely as other Europeans to give second - hand items . Websites promoting re - gifting and green gifting are popular in France , with many reporting a rise in business . \" Concerns about the ecology and the economy have come together and we are now seeing people who accept the types of gifts that were not appreciated just a short time ago , \" said Sebastien Ravut , who runs a website promoting eco - friendly consumerism . His site lists shops in France that offer fair trade products , bio - friendly goods and recycled items . Over the Christmas holidays , the number of visits to the site has doubled from last year , reaching 60 , 000 a month . A study by online survey firm Vivodi for PriceMinister showed eight out of 10 people would be happy to receive a used item as a gift and that younger consumers were more open to the idea . But Gilles Goldenberg , author of the Deloitte study , said that environmental concerns are not why customers buy used goods . \" The number one concern is getting the lowest possible price , \" said Goldenberg . \" Eco - friendly products are drawing a lot of interest , but not if that means paying more . \" Theatre tickets and other low - carbon gifts are fashionable , and eco - friendly websites are also encouraging gift givers to offer time and services instead of stuff . \" The order of the day is to spend less time shopping and more time connecting \" over the holidays , said Florence de Monclin from the Nicolas Helot foundation for Nature and Humanity .", "questions": "All the following might be a promoted gift EXCEPT", "options": {"model": ["a box of heavily packaged chocolate", "a mobile phone"], "human": ["a second - hand book", "a box of heavily packaged chocolate"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
