{"id": "2998", "article": "Parents whose children think the latest Nike or Adidas shoes may be better than buying old - fashioned plimsolls because they encourage a healthier style of running , researchers said . Big companies , like Nike and Adidas , make millions of dollars from selling highly - cushioned shoes both as fashion and sports shoes . The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way . Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes , it is very difficult to change our technique , even if we remove our shoes , it can raise the risk of injury . Children should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \" barefoot \" running style , experts said . Dr Mick Wilknson , who did the research , told the British Science Festival in Newcastle , \" If I would advise someone on what to give their child , I would say do n ' t go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike , just get them a pair of flexible , flat shoes . Give them basic foot - ware , nothing fancy , nothing particularly cushioned . \" Running in flat shoes , barefoot , encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running , especially long distances as the human was designed to do . Around the world , and in particular in the US , running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes . Dr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners , he said : \" Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s , despite claims of improvements in running shoes . That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better . \"", "questions": "Who is the passage written mainly for ?", "options": {"model": ["the british scientist festival", "the parents of young children", "the british scientists", "the british scientist festival in sydney"], "human": ["The boss of shoes shop", "The runner of long distance", "The boss of producing shoes", "The parents of young children"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
