{"id": "4467", "article": "How do you like your school ? Have you ever written to your headmaster to express your idea ? Here are some letters written by students from different schools . Luke , 14 , from Jiangsu I will give some suggestions about our school uniform . In our school , we students have to wear uniform every day . But the yellow and green sports kit looks really dark and old . It ca n ' t stand for young and lively spirit . We can add some red or orange colors and make a new type of uniform . I hope our headmaster will think about it . Danny , 14 , from Zhejiang I have two suggestions for my headmaster . First of all , I think we should have more hobby classes in science , such as plane model making class and computer programming class . It is really boring to study basic subjects all the time . And second , I hope we can have more PE lessons or more time for physical exercise . Lots of students now do n ' t have a strong enough body . Sam , 15 , from Shanxi I ' d like to say thank you to my headmaster . About one week ago , I got a bad cold after playing basketball . Our headmaster came to me after he knew about it . He took care of me until my parents came . I really want to thank him for that . Helen , 14 , from Shandong In the letter I wrote , I want to talk about the possibility of personal classes . Now many middle schools are trying the \" personal class \" system . Students do n ' t have regular classes . They can choose lessons they want to take . _ And it is also good for exercise . We do n ' t have to stay in one classroom all the time .", "questions": "According to the passage , most students write to their headmasters about", "options": {"model": ["school classes", "personal experiences"], "human": ["how to make schools better", "personal experiences"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
