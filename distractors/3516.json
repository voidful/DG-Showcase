Now , let ' s take a look at some of the inventions . Super banana Australian biogeneticist James Dale visited Uganda , a poor African country , in the early 2000s , where he found that 15 - 30 percent of children under 5 were at risk of going blind because they did not get enough Vitamin A . Dale also learned that people there love bananas . They eat three to 11 bananas a day . So he came up with the idea to plant bananas containing added nutrition in order to improve Ugandans ' health . With the help of Bill Gates ' foundation , Dale developed the \" super banana \" . He added a gene to the fruit , making it rich in Vitamin A . Coaching basketball Basketball is popular worldwide , partly because you only need a hoop and a ball to play the game . But this simple game has experienced a technology makeover this year with the development of a smart - sensor basketball . The ball , called the 94Fifty Basketball , has nine sensors inside . They can tell you anything from how fast you are going to how accurate your shot angles are . With a Bluetooth chip inside , the basketball can connect to your smartphone and tell you in the voice of a coach to \" snap your wrist \" , or \" go faster \" , depending on the data . The Hovercraft Thanks to the California - based company Hendo , flying past your friends on a floating board could soon become a reality . The Hovercraft has four small engines . These create a special magnetic field which produce enough force to lift the board off the ground . At the moment , the hoverboard can only float an inch off the ground for 15 minutes and must fly over a metal material . It ' s expensive too , at $ 10 , 000 ( 61 , 810 yuan ) , but the company hopes that one day the technology could be used . Wireless electricity Most of us could not bear to live without wireless Internet . We use it every day for everything from our phones to our cars .
