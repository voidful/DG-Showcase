{"id": "2028", "article": "Today , many species of animals and plants are endangered . This means they are in danger of becoming extinct and living on only in the pages of history books . The famous dodo is a classic example of a creature that became extinct . A flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius , it was discovered by sailors in 1598 but was hunted to extinction by 1681 . Hunting has caused the Bengal tiger and the African elephant to be endangered today but habitat destruction can also lead to extinction . This is equally true for plants . Animals and plants disappear for other reasons too , but the main cause is often a disruption ( , ) in the natural food chain , whether due to hunting , habitat destruction , or even the introduction of alien species . The natural food chain is the cycle that governs the existence of all life on this planet . It is a carefully balanced cycle and any imbalance that occurs can cause knock - on effects that have serious consequences . At the beginning of the natural food chain are plants which turn sunlight into energy and draw nutrients from the earth . Plants are called producers . After the producers come the consumers . There are three tiers of consumers . First are creatures such as plant - eating animals , fish and insects which feed off the producers . These animals that only eat plants are called herbivores . The second tier of consumers are carnivores - animals that live off other animals . The third tier of consumers eats both other animals and plants . These consumers , including most humans , are called omnivores . After animals and plants die , they become food for other smaller creatures , such as bacteria and some plants , such as fungi . As they feed , these creatures turn the dead bodies back into gases and minerals which are again food for the producers at the beginning of the food chain . And so the cycle continues . All of nature is connected and governed by hundreds of these delicate food chains and if a single plant in the chain can not survive , then the insects that live off the plant start to die and the animals that eat the insects also start to die . When a food chain is disrupted , the consequences can be extremely serious .
