{"id": "5320", "article": "In a class this past December , after I wrote some directions on the board for students about their final examination , one young woman quickly took a picture of the board using her smart phone . When I looked in her direction , she apologized : \" Sorry . Was it wrong to take a picture ? \" \" I ca n ' t read my own handwriting , \" the young woman explained . \" It ' s best if I take a picture of your writing so I can understand the notes . \" That remark started a class - wide conversation about taking a picture instead of taking notes . For those in the photo - taking camp , motivations extended beyond their inability to comprehend their own handwriting . Some took pictures of notes because they knew their phone was a safe place to store material . They might lose paper , they reasoned , but they would n ' t lose their phones . Some took photos because they wanted to record exactly the manner in which I had noted information on the board . Others told me that during class they liked to be able to listen to the discussion attentively . Yet the use of cameras as note takers , though it may be convenient , does raise significant questions for the classroom . Is a picture an effective replacement for the process of note - taking ? Instructors encourage students to take notes because the act of doing so is more than merely recording necessary information - - it helps prepare the way for understanding . Encouraging students to take notes may be an old - fashioned instructional method , but just because a method has a long history does n ' t mean it ' s out of date . Writing things down engages a student ' s brain in listening , visual , and kinesthetic learning - - a view supported by a longstanding research . The act of writing down information enables a person to begin committing it to memory , and to process and combine it , establishing the building blocks of learning new concepts . Taking a picture does indeed record the information , but it deletes some of the necessary mental engagement that taking notes employs . So can the two be equally effective ? I ' m not sure how to measure the effectiveness of either method . For now , I allow students to take notes however they see fit - - handwritten or photographed - - because I figure that some notes , no matter the method of note - taking , are better than none .", "questions": "The woman apologized in the class because she", "options": {"model": ["took a picture of the board with her hand", "took a picture of the board"], "human": ["disturbed other students ' learning", "took a picture of the board"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
