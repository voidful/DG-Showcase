{"id": "2421", "article": "What do astronauts eat in space , and why ? How did astronaut food come into being ? How do astronauts preserve food for long periods of time in space ? NASA ( the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) has been researching food for space travel since the 1960 ' s to find the best way of keeping astronauts from going hungry . The research could date from an accident that took place on the first manned Gemini mission in 1965 . astronaut John Young managed to sneak a corned beef sandwich onto the Geminni III capsule to eat during its orbit around Earth . To Young ' s surprise , the sandwich plan did not go as expected ; instead the sandwich began to break apart and scatter through the Geminni IIIcapsule . This could have resulted in disaster , since a small piece of food could have stuck in the air vents and other equipment . The sandwich was stuffed into a pocket to avoid the further mess inside the small space capsule This incident caused NASA to enforce strict rules on what types of food can be taken into space . Space food has come a long way since then . During the Gemini period , the astronauts mostly ate cubed , compressed foods high in calories and lightweight . NASA expects a long shelf life for space food . The majority of food taken into space has been dried out or heat - treated . These process and use of sodium , make the food taken into space last longer . Research is ongoing into space food to seek out healthier ways to preserve it . Too much sodium is unhealthy , and can badly change the taste of some foods .", "questions": "What happened to John Young in the Geminni III capsule ?", "options": {"model": ["he could n ' t eat the sandwich he had bought", "he could n ' t eat the lunch", "he could n ' t eat a small piece of food in space", "he could n ' t eat the bread in it"], "human": ["His sandwich went bad as expected", "His sandwich caused trouble to some equipment", "He filled his pocket with the sandwich .", "He could n ' t eat the sandwich he had bought"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
