{"id": "1496", "article": "LONDON ( Reuters ) Ecotourism is causing a lot of damage to wildlife and may be endangering the survival of the very animals people are flocking to see , according to researchers . Biologists and conservationists are worried because polar bears , dolphins , penguins and other creatures are getting stressed and losing weight and some are dying . \" Evidence is growing that many animals do not react well to tourists in their backyard , \" New Scientist magazine said . The immediate effects \" researchers have noticed are changes in behavior , heart rates . or stress hormone levels but they fear it could get much worse and over the long term \" could endanger the survival of the very wildlife they want to see . \" Although money produced through ecotourism , which has been growing at about 10 - 30 percent a year , has major benefits for poor countries and people living in rural areas , the Swiss - based World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) and some governments fear not all projects are audited and based on environmentally friendly policies , according to the magazine . Transmission of disease to wildlife , or small changes to wildlife health through disturbance of daily life or increased stress levels , while not obvious to the casual observer , may translate to lower survival and breeding , \" said Philip Seddon , of the University of Otago in Dunedin , New Zealand . Scientists have noticed that bottleneck dolphins along the northeastern coast of New Zealand become nervously excited when tourist boats arrive . Similar changes in behavior have been observed in polar bears and yellow - eyed penguins in areas visited by colorists are producing smaller babies . Conservationists are now calling for more research into the effect of ecotourism on animals and say the industry must be developed carefully . They also want studies done before new ecotourism projects are started . _ said Rochelle Constantine of the University of Auckland in New Zealand", "questions": "We may learn from the text that", "options": {"model": ["ecotourism has great impact on animals", "ecotourism has been growing", "ecotourism must be developed properly", "ecotourism has been growing at a high rate"], "human": ["polar bears are losing weight without enough food", "all the poor countries have stopped ecotourism", "money produced through ecotourism should be spent on wildlife", "ecotourism must be developed properly"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
