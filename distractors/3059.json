{"id": "3059", "article": "Walking home from work with a family friend , I found myself in a discussion about her daughter ' s going to college . It started with the mother telling me that she had no money to help her daughter go through college , which led the mother to push community college fiercely . She then started to say how she had been pushing \" high - paying \" fields on her daughter - - doctor , engineer , lawyer , etc . When I asked her if that was what her daughter had interest in , she said no . I asked her what the point was to push her daughter into something that she did n ' t like , and she responded with , \" I just want her to make a good fortune . \" After hearing her words , I would like to state that money is not everything . A high - paying job means nothing if you are miserable . I used to do a high - paid job , but it was very tiring and I had no time of my own . I did n ' t like it at all . Though the pay was good , I was not happy . So I ' d like to tell parents , please do not force your children into a major or a career just because you think they are going to make a lot of money . They would feel terrible for taking that major or job just to comfort you . The worst part is the feeling of guilty when they decide to change that major to something they actually want or when they quit that job . Being a member of a generation who are willing to give ly everything to our kids , we know we just hope our children could live happy lives . Please do not force a career path on our children just because we think it is good for them . Give our children advice , but do n ' t force them .", "questions": "The mother chose the fields for her daughter mainly because", "options": {"model": ["her daughter did n ' t like them", "she thought them were easy to make", "she considered them to be high - paying fields"], "human": ["her daughter really liked those fields", "those fields would n ' t cost much at college", "she considered them to be high - paying fields"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
