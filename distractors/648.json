{"id": "648", "article": "With tourism developing fast , you ' d expect greater understanding between the nations of the world . Not a bit of it ! Superb systems of communication by air , sea and land make it possible for us to visit each other ' s countries at a reasonable cost . What was once the \" grand tour \" , reserved for only the very rich , is now within everybody ' s grasp so that modern travelers enjoy a level of comfort . But what ' s the sense of this mass exchange of populations if the nations of the world keep ignoring each other ? Many tourist organizations deliberately set out to protect their travelers from too much contact with the local population . The modern tourist leads a sheltered life , such as living at international hotels , eating food and sipping drink there . However , he stares at the natives from a distance . Guided tours to places of interest are carefully planned . The tourist is allowed to see only what the organizers want him to see and no more , and language also holds them back . So he is only too happy to be protected in this way . The sad thing about this situation is that it leads to the continuance of national stereotypes . That is , we do n ' t see the people of other nations as they really are , but as we have been brought up to believe they are . So when you set out on your travels , the only characteristics you notice are those which confirm your previous knowledge . You leave with the highly unoriginal and inaccurate impression that , say , \" Latin peoples shout a lot \" . You only have to make foreign friends to understand how absurd and harmful national stereotypes are . But how can you make foreign friends when the tourist trade does its best to prevent you ?", "questions": "The author wrote this passage to tell us", "options": {"model": ["the way of touring should be changed", "we should n ' t travel to the countries with the tourists"], "human": ["when traveling , you notice characteristics which confirm your previous knowledge", "the way of touring should be changed"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
