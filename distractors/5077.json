{"id": "5077", "article": "Should we be afraid of sharks ? Maybe not . New research into the reasons for shark attacks suggests that sharks do n ' t like the way humans taste ! In fact , most people who are attacked by the shark are still alive after receiving only one bite . Why is this ? There are many opinions to explain why sharks sometimes attack people . One opinion is that sharks are just curious . We know that sharks are the strongest animals in their environment , so they are not afraid of anything . Naturally , that means they are curious when they meet something unusual . Because they do n ' t have hands or feet . , the only way they can find out an object is to bite it ! It is thought that sharks sometimes bite humans for this reason , and then swim away . Scientists also say that sharks would not waste energy trying to eat a human , as we have a lot of bones . It is hard for a shark to eat us because sharks do n ' t have hands , and they ca n ' t pull the meat off our bones . Maybe that ' s why they only bite us once . Unluckily , one bite from a large shark is serious enough to hurt people greatly ! Another opinion is that sharks attack humans by mistake . Some sharks may sometimes mistake humans for a seal . An example of this is when a shark attacks a surfer . A surfer lying on a surfboard looks like a seal when seen from below . Sharks like seals because they have thick fat . Whatever the reason for shark attacks on humans , sharks should be afraid of us . Sadly , we kill almost 40 million of them each year .", "questions": "Which sentence about sharks is true ?", "options": {"model": ["sharks are the strongest animals in their environment .", "sharks are not afraid of anything .", "sharks might mistake humans for seals .", "sharks usually attack humans by mistake ."], "human": ["Sharks pull meat off bones when they eat .", "Sharks like to attack surfers because of their thick fat .", "One bite from a shark is nothing serious .", "Sharks might mistake humans for seals ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
