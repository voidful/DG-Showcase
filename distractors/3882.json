{"id": "3882", "article": "China Completes First Manned Space Docking China successfully achieved its first manned space docking , an important step in the country ' s quest to launch a space station by around 2020 . The Shenzhou - 9 spacecraft on Monday docked with China ' s Tiangong - 1 space laboratory . The mission ' s three astronauts included China ' s first woman in space , an air force pilot named Liu Yang . China ' s political leadership has heavily promoted this week ' s mission as proof of the country ' s growing clout . Additionally , the Shenzhou - 9 mission reinforced China ' s long - term aspirations for a manned space presence just as the U . S . has significantly drawn down its own manned space program and retired its ageing fleet of space shuttles . The Shenzhou - 9 mission is the first time China has sent a person into space since 2008 . It follows China ' s first unmanned space docking last November and is the latest step in a 30 - year plan to assemble a space station by around 2020 , part of an effort known as Project 921 . When Chinese leaders approved a plan for a space station in 1992 , ' Chinese space professionals believed they would be latecomers to an expanding human presence in low Earth orbit , ' said Gregory Kulacki , a senior analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists , in a recent research note . ' Ironically , by the time they finish their space station in the early 2020s , the Chinese might be the only people left up there . ' Washington ' s decision to end the shuttle program left Russia with a virtual monopoly over manned spaceflight . China ' s space program , while decades behind the achievements of the U . S . and Russia , has made steady progress in recent years . Its planned space station is expected to come online around 2020 , just as the $ 100 billion International Space Station is expected to cease operation . The U . S . , meanwhile , is hoping the private sector can pick up where the shuttle program left off .", "questions": "What may happen in 2020 according to the text ?", "options": {"model": ["the chinese might be the only people who left up there .", "the chinese will leave the space station in the near future .", "the chinese might he the only people in space .", "the chinese would be late upon the space station ."], "human": ["America will stop its space research .", "Russia may be the only one over manned spaceflight .", "China may end the Project 921 .", "The Chinese might he the only people in space ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
