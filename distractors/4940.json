They built a platform so that the artist could put up a ladder on it and paint the ceiling . The platform was about 70 meters over the ground . One day the artist was working hard and nearly finished one popular corner of the ceiling . Also on the platform was his assistant , who was mixing paints . The artist stepped back so that he could see how his work was doing . To have a better look at his painting , he stepped back again . _ \" What do you think you are doing ? \" he shouted angrily . \" Are you mad ? \" His assistant replied , \" I saw you walking backwards to have a better look at your painting . But you did n ' t notice that you reached the very edge of the platform . You were in great danger . I wanted to make you move forwards . If I had not made you run forwards , you would have fallen backwards off the edge of the platform . \"", "questions": "Why did the artist step back again ?", "options": {"model": ["to see how his work was doing .", "to have a better look at his painting .", "to look at his painting ."], "human": ["To paint a bowl in his painting .", "To pour some paint on his painting .", "To have a better look at his painting ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
