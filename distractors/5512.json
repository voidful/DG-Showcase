Then the rescuing team went to the next building . Suddenly the leader ran back , calling \" Come here . \" He came to the body , put his hands under the woman , feeling and touching , then shouted loudly and gladly , \" There is someone , a baby , still living . \" Through some efforts , rescuers cleaned up the ruins which blocked her . Under her body lay her baby , who was covered by a small red quilt . He was about 3 or 4 months ' old . Since well protected by his mother ' s body , he was safe .
