{"id": "2037", "article": "Rome had the Forum . London has Speaker ' s Corner . Now always - on - the - go New Yorkers have Liz and Bill . Liz and Bill , two college graduates in their early 20s , have spent a whole year trying to have thousands of people talk to them in subway stations and on busy street corners . And just talk . Using a 2 - foot - tall sign that says , \" Talk to Me , \" they attract conversationalists , who one evening included a mental patient , and men in business suits . They do n ' t collect money . They do n ' t push religion . So what ' s the point ? \" To see what happens , \" said Liz . \" We simply enjoy life with open talk . \" Shortly after the September 11 , 2001 attacks , they decided to walk from New York City to Washington , a 270 - mile trip . They found they loved talking to people along the way and wanted to continue talking with strangers after their return . \" It started as a crazy idea . \" Liz said . \" We were so curious about all the strangers walking by with their life stories . People will talk to us about anything : their job , their clothes , their childhood experiences , anything . \" Denise wanted to talk about an exam she was about to take . She had stopped by for the second time in two days , to let the two listeners know how it went . Marcia had led her husband to a serious disease . \" That was very heavy on my mind . \" Marcia said . \" To be able to talk about it to total strangers was very good , \" she explained . To celebrate a year of talking , the two held a get - together in a city park for all the people they had met over the past year . A few hundred people appeared , as well as some television cameramen and reporters . They may plan more parties or try to attract more people to join their informal talks . Some publishers have expressed interest in a book , something the two say they ' ll consider before making a decision .", "questions": "Why are Denise and Marcia mentioned in the text ?", "options": {"model": ["they are examples of those who talked to liz and bill .", "they are different ideas of the author ' s talk ."], "human": ["They knew Liz and Bill very well .", "They are examples of those who talked to Liz and Bill ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
