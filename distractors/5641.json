{"id": "5641", "article": "Elizabeth Mitchell ' s new \" Liberty ' s Torch \" is the fascinating story of how the Statue of Liberty came to be . The Statue of Liberty ' s rough history is explored in \" Liberty ' s Torch \" . Frederic Auguste Bartholdi is an all - but - forgotten figure in American history . He was , however , responsible for one of the most enduring symbols of the United States : the Statue of Liberty . A Frenchman from Alsace , he designed and built the Statue of Liberty which stood on Bedloe ' s Island in New York Harbor . How this statue came to be is the fascinating subject of Elizabeth Michell ' s new book \" Liberty ' s Torch \" . The power of Mitchell ' s narrative is convincing . We recognize the Statue of Liberty now as a symbol of hope and opportunity for a nation of immigrants . At the time , though , people could not see that - nor did they even imagine that . Instead , the construction of the statue was born of one man ' s desire to set up a great monument . For this reason , perhaps , \" Liberty ' s Torch \" relies on Bartholdi as the connecting thread . Bartholdi went to Egypt to make photographic copies of the main monuments . On the boat , Bartholdi met and began a lifelong relationship with Ferdinand de Lesseps , the man who would build the Suez Canal . Maybe it was this friendship , or maybe it was seeing Egypt ' s huge monuments , but finally the trip inspired Bartholdi ' s dream to create the largest statue ever built . Failure to bring this to completion in Egypt , followed by his exile from Paris , led Bartholdi to sail to America . By explaining the Statue of Liberty ' s hard history and showing Bartholdi ' s brave spirit , Mitchell has done a great service .", "questions": "It can be inferred from the text that", "options": {"model": ["the statue of liberty was created by a french man", "the statue of liberty is a very popular book", "the statue of liberty was n ' t originally regarded as a symbol of hope", "the statue of liberty was a symbol of hope"], "human": ["American people have never forgotten Frederic August Bartholdi", "Bartholdi finished the Suez Canal", "Bartholdi was a famous architect from Egypt .", "the Statue of Liberty was n ' t originally regarded as a symbol of hope"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
