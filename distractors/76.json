{"id": "76", "article": "It seems that some people go out of their way to get into trouble . That ' s more or less what happened the night that Nashville Police officer Floyd Hyde was on duty . \" I was on the way to a personal - injury accident in West Nashville . As I got onto Highway 40 , blue lights and sirens going . I fell in behind a gold Pontiac Firebird that suddenly seemed to take off quickly down the highway . The driver somehow panicked at the sight of me . He was going more than a hundred miles an hour and began passing cars on the shoulder . \" But Hyde could n ' t go after him . Taking care of injured people is always more important than worrying about speeders , so the officer had to stay on his way to the accident . But he did try to keep the Firebird in sight as he drove , hoping another nearby unit would be able to step in and stop the speeding car . As it turned out , keeping the Firebird in sight was not that difficult . Every turn the Pontiac made was the very turn the officer needed to get to the accident scene . Hyde followed the Pontiac all the way to his destination . At that point he found another unit had already arrived at the accident scene . His help was n ' t needed . Now he was free to try to stop the driver of the Firebird , who by this time had developed something new to panic about . \" Just about that time , \" Hyde said , \" I saw fire coming out from under that car , with blue smoke and oil going everywhere . He ' d blown his engine . Now he had to stop . \" \" After I arrested him . I asked him why he was running . He told me he did n ' t have a driver ' s license . \" That accident cost the driver of the Firebird plenty - - - a thousand dollars for the new engine - - - not to mention the charges for driving without a license , attempting to run away , and dangerous driving .", "questions": "Which of the following statements is true ?", "options": {"model": ["the police officer did n ' t know how to drive the car .", "someone else was taking care of the injured person .", "the police officer was driving a car on the highway .", "the police officer was on the way to the accident scene ."], "human": ["The Pontiac reached its destination at the accident scene .", "Hyde knew where he was going by following the right car .", "The policeman was running after a speeder on Highway 40", "Someone else was taking care of the injured person ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
