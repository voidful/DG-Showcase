{"id": "1237", "article": "There is very simple way of measuring the height of a water - tower , which we can not measure by climbing . Suppose , for example , that we wish to find out the height of the water - tower , AB , in a factory . We first of all go to where the water - tower is standing and measure a distance of , say , 25 feet from it . Then we take a stick , and stand it in the ground at the spot we have just marked . Let us suppose the stick we are using is 4 feet in height . We now walk farther away from the water - tower in the same straight line as when we measured off the distance of 25 feet . We go from the water - tower until we come to point E , where with our head on the ground , we see the top of the stick and the top of the water - tower in the same height line - - - that is , the top of the stick just covers the highest part of the water - tower . Every schoolboy can work out the height of the water - tower now . Suppose that the line CE is five feet . We know that the stick is 4 feet high and the distance BE is 30 feet . Thus , 5 is to 4 as 30 is to AB .", "questions": "To measure a water - tower in this way ,", "options": {"model": ["we have to stand in the ground at the spot", "we have to use nothing but a stick"], "human": ["Besides a stick , tape - measure or at least a ruler is necessary .", "we have to use nothing but a stick"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
