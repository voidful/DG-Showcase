{"id": "5491", "article": "It is not a secret that these are _ times that put everyone on edge all the time and it makes people angry with their families , co - workers , friends and relatives , frustrated and highly annoyed just for the noise of the neighbors or the music coming from the opposite house . Anger and negative energy have a strong influence on everyone ' s life , even when they do n ' t realize it . Being in a calm state of mind is simply wonderful . Results of this can be seen when parents no longer shout at their children over any small thing and when one can keep him cool when bad things happen and does n ' t let the situation become worse by his negative influence . Also results can be seen on a larger scale . In 1993 a very interesting scientific experiment called The US Transcendental Meditation experiment was conducted in Washington . A company called TM got 4 , 000 calm and relaxed people to simply sit and meditate in a central Washington convention center . The results of this experiment showed that during those particular 8 weeks , violent crimes , such as murder , rape , assaults , clearly decreased by as much as 23 % . This is evident proof that meditation can change the state of mind , bring back peace of mind and collective meditation is contagious , just as anything done collectively is contagious . For example , a person has the urge to become aggressive ( while in normal circumstances that person is very calm and normal ) , just because he is sitting at a stadium watching a football game and everyone around is shouting and is aggressive . Is n ' t increasing the quality of life worth spending 20 minutes of time on meditation ? Yes , very few people follow through with a meditation method that should be a joy to do . Many start and leave it after only a few sessions . So if collective meditation has proven that meditation works , that it calms people down and that it brings their levels of stress down , why not employ it in everyday life ?", "questions": "Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["most people in the us are fond of religion .", "the research shows that people can live a happier life than people .", "meditation can cure people of many illnesses ."], "human": ["People are sometimes easily annoyed by small things .", "Many people fail to carry out a meditation method .", "Meditation can cure people of many illnesses ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
