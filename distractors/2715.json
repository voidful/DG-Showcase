{"id": "2715", "article": "After 21 years of marriage , my wife wanted me to take another woman out to dinner and a movie . The other woman my wife wanted me to visit was my mother , who has been a widow for 19 years , but the demands of my work and my three children had made it impossible to visit her often . That Friday after work , when I arrived at her house , my mother waited in the door with her coat on . She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary . We went to a restaurant that , although not elegant , was very nice and comfortable . My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady . During the dinner , we had an agreeable conversation , nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other ' s life . We talked so much that we missed the movie . As we arrived at her house later , she said , \" I ' ll go out with you again , but only if you let me invite you . \" I agreed . A few days later , my mother died of a massive heart attack . It happened so suddenly that I did n ' t have a chance to do anything for her . Some time later , I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant receipt from the same place Mother and I had dined . An attached note said \" I paid this bill in advance . I was n ' t sure that I could be there ; but , nevertheless , I paid for two plates - - one for you and the other for your wife . You w ill never know what that night meant for me . I love you , son . \" At that moment , I understood the importance of saying in time ' I love YOU ' and to give our loved ones the time that they deserve . Nothing in life is more important than your family . Give them the time they deserve because these things can not be put off till some \" other \" time .", "questions": "The author of the passage tends to agree that", "options": {"model": ["we should spend more time with our family", "we should n ' t spend too much time with our family"], "human": ["we can show our love till some other time", "we should spend more time with our family"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
