If you have children under 8 years of age weighing no more than 80 pounds , it is necessary to fit your car with a special child safety seat . The child safety seat comes in three types or sizes : the first type is designed for babies from birth to one year of age , until the baby weighs about 20 pounds ; the second size is for children between one and four years of age , who weigh between 20 and 40 pounds ; the third kind is used by older children big enough to use the car ' s belt system . Moreover , all these safety seats must be fitted and held in place on the car ' s back seat . If your child does need your attention while you are driving , do n ' t look back . Just pull over . In addition , always be sure your child is properly fastened throughout the entire trip . Children who can unfasten their own car seats are subject to fatal injuries in an accident . Start early in your child ' s life teaching them that car safety is serious business and make sure you give a good example and always wear your own seat belt .", "questions": "This passage mainly discusses", "options": {"model": ["how a child can get a safe seat while riding in a car", "how a child can get a safety seat", "how a child can be kept safe while riding in a car"], "human": ["why the back seat is the safest place in a car", "how a child safety seat can protect a child", "how a child can be kept safe while riding in a car"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
