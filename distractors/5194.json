{"id": "5194", "article": "In 1993 , New York State ordered stores to charge money on beverage containers . Within a year , consumers had returned millions of aluminum cans and glass and plastic bottles . Plenty of companies were eager to accept the aluminum and glass as raw material for new products , but because few could figure out what to do with the plastic , much of it wound end up buried in landfills . The problem was not limited to New York . Unfortunately , there were too few uses for second - hand plastic . Today , one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the United States . The reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post , paint brushes , etc . As the New York experience shows , recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish . A discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life - - and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value . Without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling , throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials . Fewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling . In many areas , the East Coast especially , recycling is already the least expensive waste - management choice . For every ton of waste recycled , a city avoids paying for its disposal ( , ) , which , in parts of New York , amounts to savings of more than $ 100 per ton . Recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material .", "questions": "The key problem in dealing with returned plastic beverage containers is", "options": {"model": ["how to use them for recycling", "how to turn them into useful things", "how to make them recycled"], "human": ["how to reduce their recycling costs", "to lower the prices for used materials", "how to turn them into useful things"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
