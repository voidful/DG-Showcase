{"id": "4474", "article": "New York is a very large city with 8 million people . How do so many people move about the city on their way to work and school ? So , we should know something about its transportation . In New York you can travel about the city by subway , bus , taxi and car . The subway runs on the railroad lines under the city . It crosses the city at different points and goes all parts of the city . Traveling by subway is the fastest way to get around the city . The second way to travel around the city is by public bus . It ' s a slower way to travel . This is because the bus moves in road traffic which is often heavy . You can also travel around the city by taxi . This is the most expensive way , but the taxi will take you to the very place you wish to go to . If traffic is heavy , the taxi will be slow . During the mornings and afternoons , this is the \" rush hour \" . This is the time when the traffic is very heavy with people going to and from work . The last way to get around New York is using your own car . However , it ' s not easy for you to drive , especially when you are driving in the \" rush hour \" . If there is an accident on the road , you will have to wait for a long time . The best time to travel around the city is from 9 am to 4 pm . This is the time after the morning \" rush hour \" and before the evening \" rush hour \" . Traffic will be less crowded because most people are already at school or at work .", "questions": "This passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["new york is a city with many people", "a fast way to travel around new york", "the city in new york", "the transportation of new york"], "human": ["the weather of New York", "the people in New York", "traffic accidents in New York", "the transportation of New York"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
