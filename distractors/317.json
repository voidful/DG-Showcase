{"id": "317", "article": "Car sharing is another way to drive green that ' s gaining in popularity , especially in urban areas . People who may not drive every day but still want a car to run errands or drive on weekends benefit most from car sharing . Car sharing is usually run by a service like Zipcar , though there are non - profit and informal car sharing services . Members pay a monthly fee and have access to an entire fleet of cars when they need one . The cars are parked in fixed spots around the city , so members only need to make a reservation , and then go to the pickup spot . Car sharing has major environmental benefits because it reduces the number of cars on the road . Members do n ' t drive just because they are in a car . They plan trips , and if they do n ' t need a car , they do n ' t use one . Still , a car is available to them if they need to make a big trip to the grocery store , pick someone up at the airport or if they want to go to the beach for the day . Members also benefit by having access to a car without any of the headaches of ownership . They usually do n ' t have to pay for the gas , insurance or maintenance , and the monthly membership fee is less than a typical car payment . So if you really want to go green but are n ' t ready to totally give up a car yet , car sharing may be the way to go . If you still need to get around , but want to go even greener than sharing a car , share a bus !", "questions": "We can conclude from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["zipcar is a company providing car sharing service for a family", "zipcar is a company supplying car sharing service for a monthly payment", "the price of cars on the road is the lowest", "zipcar is a car sharing service"], "human": ["Zipear ca n ' t help you if you are running urgent errands", "Zipcar , different from other services , aims green driving with no profit", "Zipcar is a company providing formal car sharing free", "Zipcar is a company supplying car sharing service for a monthly payment"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
