{"id": "296", "article": "One day an ant was drinking at a small stream and fell in . She made desperate efforts to reach the side , but made no progress at all . The poor ant almost exhausted was still bravely doing her best when a dove saw her . Moved with pity , the bird threw her a blade of grass , which supported her like a raft , and thus the ant reached the bank again . While she was resting and drying herself in the grass , she heard a man come near . He was walking along barefooted with a gun in his hand . As soon as he saw the dove , he wished to kill it . He would certainly have done so , but the ant bit him in the foot just as he raised his gun to fire . He stopped to see what had bit him , and the dove immediately flew away . It was an animal much weaker and smaller than herself that had saved her life .", "questions": "The dove saved the ant because", "options": {"model": ["she took pity on the poor ant", "she saw the ant"], "human": ["the ant was almost exhausted", "she took pity on the poor ant"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
