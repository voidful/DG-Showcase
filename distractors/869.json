{"id": "869", "article": "Sometimes people add to what they say even when they do n ' t talk . Gestures are the \" silent language \" of every culture . We point a finger or move another part of the body to show what we want to say . It is important to know the body language of every country or we may be misunderstood . In the United States , people greet each other with a handshake in a formal introduction . The handshake must be firm . If the handshake is weak , it is a sign of weakness or unfriendliness . Friends may place a hand on the other ' s arm or shoulder . Some people , usually women , greet a friend with a hug . Space is important to Americans . When two people talk to each other , they usually stand about two and a half feet away and at an angle , so they are not facing each other directly . Americans get uncomfortable when a person stands too close . They will move back to have their space . If Americans touch another person by accident , they say , \" Pardon me . \" or \" Excuse me . \" Americans like to look the other person in the eyes when they are talking . If you do n ' t do so , it means you are bored , hiding something , or are not interested . But when you stare at someone , it is not polite . For Americans , thumbs - up means yes , very good , or well done . Thumbs - down means the opposite . To call a waiter , raise one hand to head level or above . To show you want the check , make a movement with your hands as if you are singing a piece of paper . It is all right to point at things but not at people with the hand and index finger . Americans shake their index finger at children when they scold them and pat them on the head when they admire them . Learning a culture ' s body language is sometimes confusing . If you do n ' t know what to do , the safest thing to do is to smile .", "questions": "If you are introduced to a stranger from the USA , you should", "options": {"model": ["hold your body language", "shake his hand firmly", "raise one hand to head"], "human": ["place a hand on his shoulder", "shake his hand weakly", "shake his hand firmly"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
