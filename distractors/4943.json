But do you know there are people called \" banana persons \" ? If you do n ' t know , I will tell you . They are Chinese people like you and me , but they are n ' t in China . Why do people call them like that ? \" ABC \" means American - born Chinese . An \" ABC \" is a Chinese , but was born in the United States . Sometimes , people also call them \" banana persons \" . A banana is yellow outside and white inside . So when a person is a banana , he or she is white ( American ) inside and yellow ( Chinese ) outside . They are born in America and they live in America for a long time . Even their nationality is American . So they think like Americans and do things like Americans . But they still have Chinese blood . Their parents , grandparents or even great - grandparents were from China . They all have black eyes and black hair . So they look like us Chinese people . For example , we all know the famous scientist C . N . Yang . He is an \" ABC \" and he is a \" banana person \" . We like him , although his nationality is n ' t Chinese .", "questions": "What does \" ABC \" mean ?", "options": {"human": ["American - born Canadian", "Australian - born Chinese", "Chinese - born Chinese", "American - born Chinese"]}, "answer": {"human": 3}}
