{"id": "1571", "article": "Here is a passage about learning a foreign language . Outside of class , the most natural way of finding out if you are making mistakes is from other people ' s responses . If the mistakes are too serious , your listeners will be asking you all the time what you mean . If they are not so serious , then people may be asking you whether you said such and such . That will tell you how close you are to speaking \" cogently \" . Of course , there are other times when it is important to have errors pointed out . Your class assignments are probably marked in this way , in which case you need to spend time going over them to take advantage of the individual feedback . In some classes the teacher gets better and better at grammar because she does all the corrections , but the students make slow progress if , when an assignment is returned , they quickly stuff it into their folders without looking . You are the person who should be connecting your error , even if the marker has signaled them , when you look at them ; there are some steps to work through . One distinction that has been made about learners ' language is this . You make mistakes about rules that you already know but you make errors about points you have n ' t learned yet . In other words , you can find your own mistakes , but not your errors . First , make sure you understand what you have written or said , or your correction will simply be another stab at the right answer . Next , decide on the best way of practicing the correct form . Would it help you to write out the sentence once more ? Can you make up another similar sentence ? Then you could test yourself in a few days time to see whether you have remembered the right form , anyone can get it right immediately after being told . He challenge is to remember it and apply it later .", "questions": "Which of the following might be the most important to work through your mistakes ?", "options": {"model": ["giving more time to the mistakes .", "giving the students more time to remember the right form .", "keeping the right form in mind and using it later ."], "human": ["Learning your mistakes by heart .", "Correcting your mistakes and writing down the teacher ' s words .", "Keeping the right form in mind and using it later ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
