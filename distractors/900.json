{"id": "900", "article": "On a wet Wednesday evening in Seoul , six government employees gathered at the office to prepare for a late - night patrol . The mission is to find children who are studying after 10 p . m . and stop them . In South Korea , it has come to this . To reduce the country ' s addiction to private , after - hours tutoring academies ( called hagwons ) , the authorities have begun enforcing a curfew - - even rewarding citizens for turning in violators . But cramming is deeply anchored in Asia , where top grades have long been prized as essential for professional success . Before toothbrushes or printing presses , there were civil service exams that could make or break you . Chinese families have been hiring test preparation tutors since the 7th century . Nowadays South Korea has taken this competition to new extremes . In 2010 , 74 % of all students engaged in some kind of private after - school instruction , sometimes called shadow education , at an average cost of KRW 2 , 600 per student for a year . There are more private instructors in South Korea than school teachers , and the most popular of them make millions of dollars a year from online and in - person classes . When Singapore ' s Education Minister was asked last year about his nation ' s reliance on private tutoring , he found one reason for hope , \" We are not as bad as the Koreas . \" In Seoul , legions of students who failed to get into top universities spend the entire year after high school attending hagwons to improve their scores on university admission tests . And they must compete even to do this . At the prestigious Daesung Institute , admission is based on students ' test scores . Only 14 % of applicants are accepted . After a year of 14 - hour days , about 70 % gain entry to one of the nation ' s top three universities . South Koreans are not alone in their discontent . Across Asia , reformers are pushing to make schools more \" American \" - - even as some U . S . reformers make their own schools more \" Asian \" . In China , universities have begun fashioning new entry tests to target students with talents beyond book learning . And Taiwanese officials recently announced that kids will no longer have to take high - stress exams to get into high school . In South Korea , the apogee of extreme education , gets its reforms right ,", "questions": "The six government employees were asked to", "options": {"model": ["take part in public activities", "ask the government for help", "prevent students from studying too late"], "human": ["arrest the students who work late at night", "conduct a survey among students", "prevent students from studying too late"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
