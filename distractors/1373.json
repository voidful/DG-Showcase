Suddenly he took his own life , which remains a mystery . That morning , everyone sensed that something was n ' t right . During our lessons , an announcement was made that an assembly was scheduled for morning break , which was only done in emergencies . Once morning break came , the entire school gathered in the main hall . As our headmaster marched out to announce the \" momentous news \" , it felt like the air around us trembled .
