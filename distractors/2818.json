{"id": "2818", "article": "Long bus rides are like television shows . They have a beginning , a middle , and an end with commercials thrown in every three or four minutes . The commercials are unavoidable . They happen whether you want them or not . Every couple of minutes a billboard glides by outside the bus window . \" Buy Super Clean Toothpaste . \" \" Drink Good Wet Root Beer . \" \" Fill up with Pacific Gas . \" Only when you have fallen asleep , which is equal to turning the television set off , can you get separated from the unending cry of \" You Need It ! Buy It Now ! \" As for the ride itself , the beginning of it is comfortable and somewhat exciting , even if you ' ve traveled that way before . Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows - - various houses , crop fields , attractive bridges , . . . and sometimes even a small accident . Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it ' s fun trying experience it the first hour or so . If the driver is particularly reckless or daring , the ride can be as thrilling as an adventurous story . Will the driver pass the truck in time ? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane ? After a while , of course , the excitement dies down . Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride . Food always makes bus rides more interesting . But you ' ve got to be careful of what kind of food you eat . Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops . The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning . You know the riding will soon be over and there ' s a kind of expectation and excitement with that . The seat , of course , has become harder for the hours having passed . By now you may sit with your legs crossed , or with your hands in your lap , or with your hands on the arms , or even with your hands crossed behind your head . That is to say that the end comes just at no more ways to sit .", "questions": "The writer of this passage would probably prefer", "options": {"model": ["no billboards along the road", "bus drivers on long bus rides", "no billboards on the bus"], "human": ["those reckless bus drivers", "a television set on the bus", "no billboards along the road"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
