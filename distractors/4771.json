{"id": "4771", "article": "To : manager @ tastytreat . com Date : Monday , 7th October , 3 : 34 p . m . From : raymondyuen @ canada . net Subject : Complaint Dear Mr . Price , I have eaten in your restaurant many times and have always been happy with the food and service . This makes what happened last Saturday even more disappointing . It was my son ' s birthday so we booked a non - smoking table at your restaurant for 7 : 30 p . m . We arrived on time but were told that our table was not yet ready . At 8 : 00 p . m . , we were given a table in the smoking area . I asked to move but I was told that there were no other tables . A lot of people were smoking so it was uncomfortable and unhealthy . Our first waitress , Janet , was very polite and helpful . She gave us free drinks for waiting so long . Our food also came quickly and looked fresh and tasty . When my wife had eaten most of her meal , she found a dead cockroach in her vegetables . She was shocked and wanted to leave . At first , the waitress told us it was a piece of garlic . When we told her it had legs , she apologized ( = \" said \" sorry ) and took the food away . We asked for the pay for my wife ' s meal bill , expecting not to pay for my wife ' s meal . Nobody came . After 15 minutes , I asked to see the manager . The headwaiter told us that you were on holiday . I complained again about the horrible cockroach . He told me Janet had finished work . He did n ' t believe my story and gave me a bill for three meals . I argued with him but was forced to pay . The waitress , Janet , was always friendly , but I would like an apology from your impolite headwaiter and a full refund for our meal . It cost $ 68 . Until then , I will not be eating at your restaurant or recommending it to anyone . You can contact me at 742 - 3254 or through e - mail if you want more information . Thank you for your attention . Yours sincerely , Raymond Yuen", "questions": "The headwaiter did n ' t believe Mr .
