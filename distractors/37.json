{"id": "37", "article": "Until late in the 20th century , most Americans spent time with people of generations . Now mid - aged Americans may not keep in touch with old people until they are old themselves . That ' s because we group people by age . We put our three - year - olds together in day - care center , our 13 - year - olds in school and sports activities , and our 80 - year - olds in senior - citizen homes . Why ? We live away from the old for many reasons : young people sometimes avoid the old to get rid of fears for aging and dying . It is much harder to watch . someone we love disappear before our eyes . Sometimes it ' s so hard that we stay away from the people who need us most . Fortunately , . some of us have found our way to the old . And we have discovered that they often save the young . A reporter moved her family onto a block filled with old people . At first her children were disappointed . But the reporter baked banana bread for the neighbours and had her children deliver it and visit . Soon the children had many new friends , with whom they shared food , stories and projects . \" My children have never been less lonely , \" the reporter said . The young , in turn , save the old . Once I was in a rest home when a visitor showed up with a baby . She was immediately surrounded . People who had n ' t gotten out of bed in a week suddenly were ringing for a wheelchair . Even those who had seemed asleep wake up to watch the child . Babies have an astonishing power to comfort and cure . Grandparents are a special case . They give grandchildren a feeling of security and continuity . As my husband put it , \" my grandparents gave me a deep sense that things would turn out right in the end . \" Grandchildren speak of attention they do n ' t get from worried parents . \" My parents were always telling me to hurry up , and my grandparents told me to slow down , \" one friend said . A teacher told me she can tell which pupils have relationships with grandparents : they are quieter , calmer , more trusting .", "questions": "Why do children not get attention from their parents ?", "options": {"model": ["because their parents do n ' t care about their children ' s bad feelings .", "because their parents are too busy to take care of them ."], "human": ["Because their parents have to take care of their grandparents .", "Because their parents are too busy to take care of them ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
