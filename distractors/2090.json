{"id": "2090", "article": "Taking exams in a large group setting can be stressful for students and for the staff members who are watching over them . When classrooms are crowded and desks are close together , cheating might be tempting . One university in Thailand came up with an anti - cheating hat that makes it almost impossible for students to see other students ' papers . A photo of the students wearing the anti - cheating hats made its way to the Internet , and the university was criticized for making students wear those ridiculous looking homemade hats . The hats were made by stapling pieces of paper onto a headband , one to each side of the head . After being criticized , senior academic staff at Kasetsart University in Bangkok , Thailand , released a statement saying that the hats idea came from students . They said that in a bid to prevent cheating they asked the students for ideas on how to prevent cheating in the upcoming exam , which was being taken by almost one hundred students . Students came up with different ideas , then the paper hat idea was selected by them as the most suitable . The university claimed that no one was forced to use the hat , but they all chose to do so . \" When wearing the hat during the exam , students felt more relaxed , \" Nattadon Rungruangkitkrai , a lecturer at the university said . \" It was not meant to indicate that Kasetsart students often cheat on exams . I apologize if the photo makes other people look at my students in a negative way , \" Rungruangkitkrai added .", "questions": "What ' s the best title of the text ?", "options": {"model": ["differences between students", "a photo", "anti - cheating hat", "differences between students and their students"], "human": ["How to make the anti - cheating hat", "Anti - cheating hat was criticized", "Anti - cheating hat was considered the most suitable choice", "Anti - cheating hat"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
