{"id": "4031", "article": "I was 9 years old when I found out my father was ill . It was 1994 , but I can remember my mother ' s words as if it were yesterday : \" Kerrel , I do n ' t want you to take food from your father , because he has AIDS . Be very careful when you are around him . \" AIDS was n ' t something we talked about in my country when I was growing up . From then on , I knew that this would be a family secret . My parents were not together anymore , and my dad lived alone . For a while , he could take care of himself . But when I was 12 , his condition worsened . My father ' s other children lived far away , so it fell to me to look after him . We could n ' t afford all the necessary medication for him , and because Dad was unable to work , I had no money for school supplies and often could n ' t even buy food for dinner . I would sit in class feeling completely lost , the teacher ' s words muffled as I tried to figure out how I was going to manage . I did not share my burden with anyone . I had seen how people reacted to AIDS . Kids laughed at classmates who had parents with the disease . And even adults could be cold . When my father was moved to the hospital , the nurses would leave his food on the bedside table even though he was too weak to feed himself . I had known that he was going to die , but after so many years of keeping his condition a secret , I was completely unprepared when he reached his final days . Sad and hopeless , I called a woman at the nonprofit National AIDS Support . That day , she kept me on the phone for hours . I was so lucky to find someone who cared . She saved my life . I was 15 when my father died . He took his secret away with him , having never spoken about AIDS to anyone , even me . He did n ' t want to call attention to AIDS . I do .", "questions": "The purpose of the passage is", "options": {"model": ["to call on people to save the patients .", "to draw people ' s attention to aids .", "to tell people how to deal with aids .", "to tell people about aids ."], "human": ["To tell people about the sufferings of her father .", "To show how little people knew about AIDS .", "To remember her father .", "To draw people ' s attention to AIDS ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
