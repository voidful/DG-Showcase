{"id": "1773", "article": "British and American scientists are raising genetically modified pigs in the hope of providing organs for transplant to humans , the project leader wrote in a newspaper Sunday . Scientists in London and California have begun conducting the genetic experiments to find a solution to record - long waiting lists for organ transplants , Robert Winston said in an opinion piece written for Britain ' s Sunday Times . In Britain alone , around 8 , 000 patients are waiting for a transplant . \" People needing a new heart or liver are waiting for someone else to die - usually a violent death in a traffic accident , \" Winston wrote in the newspaper . He said his team was \" trying to modify pigs so their organs might save the lives of humans . \" The scientists are introducing human genes into the animals to reduce the chances of the organs being rejected by patients , as has been common in previous attempts to use animal tissues , said Winston , who heads the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology at London ' s Hammersmith Hospital . Working with Dr . Carol Redhead of the California Institute of Technology , Winston ' s team has injected human genes directly into male piglets , adding them to the animal ' s sperm . He said that pigs involved in experiments had successfully produced transgenic sperm , but acknowledged that British and European laws had prevented the team from using the pigs to mate . The Sunday Times newspaper reported that the experiments would be moved to the United States following difficulties with funding and regulations in Britain . It said the pigs would be bred in Missouri . \" Our U . S . friends will benefit from our technology and the income we might have produced for Britain will be lost , \" Winston wrote . Some scientists have previously blamed the idea of using animal organs for human transplant , saying the technique risks spreading animal viruses to humans . Winston said his research project is attempting to breed virus - free pigs .", "questions": "Scientists are introducing human genes into the animals to", "options": {"model": ["reduce the chances of rejection", "prevent the patients from being attacked by humans", "test the organs of human beings", "make the animals cleverer"], "human": ["make the organs healthier", "reduce the pain of animals", "make the organs live longer", "reduce the chances of rejection"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
