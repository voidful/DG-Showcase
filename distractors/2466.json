{"id": "2466", "article": "I spotted ( ; ) him at the checkout counter , bagging at No . 14 . His arms shook violently as he placed a box of eggs into a plastic bag . He wore a name card upon which he had wiritten \" Jerry \" in kindergarten handwriting . He looked middle - aged but his mental age must have been about 12 . Ever since I smiled at him the first time he bagged my groceries at my local supermarket , Jerry has followed me around like an adoring fan . His lack of boundaries makes me uncomfortable . I do n ' t know how to avoid being noticed by him . I do n ' t want to speak to the manager - - my complaint could get him fired . So I started avoiding him . I can still remember the hurt I felt when I was 10 and our neighbor Mrs . Ward did n ' t respond when I said hello with David and Diane . Instead , she hurried out of the supermarket , leaving me holding my brother and sister ' s hands . I realized at that moment that I hated Mrs . Ward ' s reaction . Why , then , years later , was I acting as she had ? I picked up a magazine Real Simple . The beautiful photos did nothing to straighten out the guilt in me . I was being ridiculous . The last three times I have seen Jerry , I rushed . There are other stores , but I chose this one because it employs people with disabilities . I want people like my brothers to have jobs . I do n ' t want them to be ignored , the way I am avoiding Jerry .", "questions": "Why did the author feel uncomfortable ?", "options": {"model": ["jerry did n ' t want to speak to her boss", "jerry did n ' t keep a proper distance from her", "she did n ' t get along well with jerry"], "human": ["Jerry was like a fan of her", "Real Simple could n ' t straighten out her guilt", "Jerry did n ' t keep a proper distance from her"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
