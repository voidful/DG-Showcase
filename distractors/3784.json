Gomes is one of thousands of young illegal immigrants who grew up in the United States and are now studying at American colleges and universities . He is doing well in his studies , but he is fighting deportation to India , a country he left with his parents when he was just 14 months old . They were deported more than a year ago . \" If I was to go back to India I would just feel like all of that would have gone to waste because here at least I am still able to go to college , \" he said . Immigration is a divisive political issue in the United States with some 11 million people in the country illegally . One element of the debate is the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16 . Pending legislation know as the DREAMAct would give them a chance to become legal residents if they complete two years of college or join the military . Milanie Schwartz , a politically conservative student at the University of Texas , explains why some Americans oppose the legislation . \" We think it ' s unfair that students who are illegal immigrants would get a fast track to citizenship , while people who did come here legally would n ' t have those same opportunities , \" she said . \" The question is legalization or not , \" said Jon Feere , who also opposes the DREAM Act . He is a policy analyst with the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington and is concerned about the act ' s effect on the economy . \" There ' s a lot of unemployment in the United States right now . And there are already many legal immigrants who are already here who are desperate for those jobs , \" he said . But supporters of the DREAMAct say well - educated immigrants would help the economy . Raul Hinojosa is an immigration research analyst at UCLA . \" Not letting them contribute to the economy would not only lose all the financial investment we have already made in these youths", "questions": "What can we conclude from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["it does n ' t matter whether the dream act has been passed .", "not all the people approve of the passage of the dreamact .", "the government does n ' t support the government ' s idea of the legal immigrants .", "it does n ' t matter whether the dream act is legalization or not ."], "human": ["The DREAMAct was abandoned in Congress ten years ago .", "If the DREAMAct should win passage , all illegal immigrants would become US citizens .", "Illegal immigrants are attached to their motherlands .", "Not all the people approve of the passage of the DREAMAct ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
