{"id": "4192", "article": "Once a 10 - year - old boy decided to learn judo though he had lost his left arm in a car accident . The boy began lessons with an old Japanese sensei , a judo teacher . Three months later , he was still practising with the same move . So he asked , \" Sensei , should n ' t I be learning more moves ? \" \" This is the only move you know , but this is the only move you ' ll ever need to know , \" the sensei replied . The boy kept training . Months later , the sensei took him to his first match . Surprisingly , the boy easily won his first two matches . The third match was more difficult , but after some time , his opponent became impatient . The boy used his one move to win the match and now was in the final . This time , his opponent was bigger , stronger , and more experienced . For a while , the boy seemed to lose the game . Being worried that the boy might get hurt , the referee called a break . Just before the referee wanted to end the match , the sensei came to him . \" No , \" the sensei said , \" let him go on . \" Soon after the match began , his opponent made a big mistake : he dropped his guard . Suddenly , the boy won the match . On the way home , the boy and the sensei talked about every move in each match . Then the boy gathered the courage to ask , \" Sensei , how did I win the match with only one move ? \" \" You won for two reasons , \" the sensei answered . \" First , you ' ve learned one of the most difficult throws in all of judo . Second , the only known guard for that move is for your opponent to catch your left arm . \"", "questions": "The boy could win all the matches mainly because", "options": {"model": ["the boy had a strong sense of direction", "the boy had a lot of skills to learn from", "the boy ' s biggest weakness became his biggest strength", "the boy could n ' t find the right hand to keep the game"], "human": ["his opponents made more mistakes than he did", "his opponents were more impatient than he was", "the boy was better at guard than his opponents were", "the boy ' s biggest weakness became his biggest strength"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
