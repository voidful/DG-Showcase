{"id": "1293", "article": "Opened in 1971 , the Magic Kingdom was the first theme park at Walt Disney World . All Disney World theme parks are open 365 days a year , although opening and closing times for each park are different from day to day . If you are traveling without kids , try to visit it on a school day to avoid the largest crowds . If you need to visit it during a school vacation , try at least to avoid the week between Christmas and New Year ' s Day and the Fourth of July . If you are not staying at a Disney World hotel , avoid visiting the Magic Kingdom on its Extra Magic Hours days . The hotel guests get into the park early on those days , increasing the waiting time for visitors who arrive at the normal opening time . Buy your Walt Disney World tickets online at Disney World ' s website . There will be some advice on picking the right ticket . See the guide to Disney World tickets . You will also need to call in advance to make lunch or dinner reservations . Disney accepts reservations , through 1 - 407 - WDW - DINE , up to 180 days in advance . Time does pass quickly , so you should call six months before your trip to get a lunch reservation in the castle . We suggest you should have your lunch at Cinderella ' s Royal Table for your tour . If you ca n ' t get the reservation , ask for the Liberty Tree Tavern instead . Keep in mind that to reach the Magic Kingdom , you must park at Disney World ' s Transportation and Ticket Center ( TTC ) parking lot , take a tram , and then take a boat across the Seven Seas Lagoon to the Magic Kingdom .", "questions": "What would be the best title for this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["advice on making a trip to the magic kingdom", "tickets to the magic kingdom", "how to visit the magic kingdom", "how to enjoy a magic kingdom"], "human": ["The History of the Magic Kingdom", "A Brief Introduction to the Magic Kingdom", "The Most Important Theme Park at Walt Disney World", "Advice on Making a Trip to the Magic Kingdom"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
