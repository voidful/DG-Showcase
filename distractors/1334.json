{"id": "1334", "article": "Being honest are fundamental requirements if you want to grow spiritually and follow your true destination of personal development . It ' s not simply about being honest with people . While that will make you a better person and a more accepted one it ' s more importantly about being honest with yourself . Living your life honestly means that you ' ve decided to live openly and to show your true self to others and that you can be relied upon to be trustworthy . On the other hand , dishonesty is all about shade and concealment and living your life in ' dark corners ' . When you ' re dishonest , it means that you remain living in the dark and can not grow spiritually . Honesty produces trust - trust in ourselves and in all those around us . Trust in turn produces confidence which we all need to overcome life ' s problems and which also encourages us to take risks in order to achieve our goals . You ' ll have no doubt you have heard expressions such as \" what goes around , comes around \" and \" you get back , what you give out in life \" and that ' s very true . If you do n ' t live your lives honestly , you can be assured that the people you ' ll attract will turn out to be very similar to you and it ' s therefore unavoidable that one day you ' 11 be on the receiving end of someone ' s dishonest actions or words . There may be situations where telling the whole truth causes you to bring a lot of pain on somebody else . For example , John may have told Paul that he ca n ' t go on a weekend fishing trip with him because he has a family commitment arranged that weekend . You know differently and that the real reason John is n ' t going is because he hates Paul . When Paul asks you if you know whether the reason is true , what do you say ? Well , in situations like this , it ' s often better to be economical with the truth . You might say that you do n ' t know why John ca n ' t go or that you think he has something on that weekend . \" Of course , this is n ' t telling the complete truth but you are sparing Paul ' s feelings on something that wo n ' t , after all , have strong influence on Paul ' s future .", "questions": "What is the main idea of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["being honest helps you develop .", "honesty helps you develop ."], "human": ["Trust produces confidence .", "Honesty helps you develop ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
