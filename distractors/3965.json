{"id": "3965", "article": "\" Avoid the rush hour \" must be the slogan of large cities all over the world . Wherever you look it ' s people , people , people . The trains which leave or arrive every few minutes are packed . The streets are so crowded ; there is hardly room to move on the pavements . It takes ages for a bus to get to you because the traffic on the roads has almost come to a standstill . Even when a bus does at last arrive , it ' s so full , it ca n ' t take any more passengers . The smallest unexpected event can bring about conditions of complete chaos . The strange thing is not that people stand these conditions , but that they actually choose them in preference to anything else . Large modern cites are too big to control . People living there are forced by their environment to take a wholly unnatural way of life . They lost touch with the land and rhythm of nature . It is possible to live in such an air - conditioned existence in a large city that you can hardly tell the season . A few flowers in a public park may remind you that it is spring or summer . All the simple , good things of life like sunshine and fresh air are hard to find . Even the distinction between days and nights is lost . The funny thing about it all is that you pay dearly to live in a city . The demand for accommodation is so great that it is often impossible for ordinary people to buy a house of their own . The cost of living is also very high . Just about everything you buy is likely to be more expensive than it would be in the country . Besides , the crime rate in most cities is very high . If you think about it , they ' re not really fit to live in at all . Can anyone really doubt that the country is what man was born for and where he truly belongs ?", "questions": "The reason for things to be more expensive in a city than elsewhere is that", "options": {"model": ["there is a growing demand for accommodation in the city", "people live in the city in a large area", "there is a greater demand for things in a city", "people live in the city more than a few years ago"], "human": ["city people have to pay higher to live in a city", "things are better in a city than elsewhere", "people in a city are much more wealthy", "there is a greater demand for things in a city"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
