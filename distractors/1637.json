{"id": "1637", "article": "In 1693 the philosopher John Locke warned that children should not be given too much \" unhealthy fruit \" to eat . Three centuries later , misguided ideas about child - raising are still popular . Many parents fear that their children will die unless ceaselessly watched . In America the law can be equally paranoid . In South Carolina this month Debra Harrell was jailed for letting her 9 - year - old daughter play in a park unsupervised . Her severe punishment reflects the rich world ' s worry about parenting . By most objective measures , modern parents are far more conscientious than previous generations . Dads are more hands - on than their fathers were , and working mothers spend more time nurturing their children than the housewives of the 1960s did . However , there are two problems in this picture , connected to class . One is at the lower end . Even if poor parents spend more time with their children than they once did , they spend less than rich parents do . America is a _ here : its government spends abundantly on school - age kids but much less than other rich countries on the first two or three years of life . If America did more to help poor parents with young children , it would have huge returns . The second one , occurs at the other end of the income scale , and may even apply to otherwise rational Economist readers : well - educated , rich parents try to do too much . Safety is part of it - - they fear that if they are not constantly watching their children may break their necks , which is the least rational . Despite the impression you get from watching crime dramas , children in rich countries are safe , so long as they look both ways before crossing the road . The other popular parental fear - - that your children might not get into an Ivy League college - - is more rational . Academic success matters more than ever before . But beyond a certain point , parenting makes less difference than many parents imagine . Studies in Minnesota and Sweden , for example , found that identical twins grew up equally intelligent whether they were raised together or apart . A study in Colorado found that children that adopted and raised by brainy parents ended up no brainier than those adopted by average parents .
