{"id": "2056", "article": "Let ' s say you have a piece of wood , a nail , and a hammer . Pretend the wood is a person , and the nail is a mean rumor about that person . If you hammer in the nail , you ' re obviously hurting him or her . If you then pull out the nail , there ' s still a hole in the wood , and the damage has been done . There are many reasons why that nail of a rumor can be so harmful . Rumors are , quite simply , a form of bullying . When a person or a group makes up a rumor about someone or decides to spread gossip , it ' s usually to hurt someone , break up a friendship , or make someone less popular . It ' s the same thing as teasing , only it ' s done behind someone ' s back instead of to his or her face . When you spread a rumor about someone , you ' re sending a signal that the person is outside of the group , and somehow less worthy of friendship than others . You ' re making fun of that person or pointing out negative things about him or her . This can let others think that it ' s okay to make the person feel bad , and make him or her an outsider . We need to be able to trust our friends , and gossip and rumors can break this trust . If you tell a personal secret to a friend , and he turns around and tells it to someone else , you might feel like you will get burned if you ever get close to him again . Letting a rumor influence your behavior is like letting someone else make a big decision for you . Let ' s say you hear that the teacher plans to call a Snow Day tomorrow because a blizzard is coming . Expecting a day off , you do n ' t do your homework . The next morning , the blizzard turns out to be nothing more than a drizzle , and school is n ' t off after all . You get zeroes on your work .", "questions": "The purpose of this passage is to", "options": {"model": ["tell us how to deal with rumors", "tell us how to rumors", "explain why rumors hurt", "tell us how to react to a rumors"], "human": ["advise on how to deal with rumors", "teach us how to judge a rumor", "find out why rumors spread fast", "explain why rumors hurt"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
