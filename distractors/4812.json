{"id": "4812", "article": "Nearly all kids have had the same experience . They are eating in a restaurant with their parents . They finished the spaghetti minutes ago . Now , they are bored . Their little brother is kicking them under the table . He is also complaining about the desserts . Yet their parents are still eating and talking . . . and talking . . . and talking . \" Be patient . \" One parent says . \" We ' ll have dessert soon . \" All kids know what happens next . After dessert , their parents drink coffee . Then they talk some more . Again , the children must wait . They have been in school all day and would rather be running and playing . Instead , they must sit in a chair and stare at a wall . Going to a restaurant does n ' t have to be this way . Many restaurants say they are \" family - friendly \" . Family restaurants , such as fast - food restaurants should play areas for children . At these restaurants , almost every play area is a big room full of climbing equipment . The room is usually , packed with happy kids . Parents can eat while the children play . Everyone is happy . The real problem begins when families want to eat a fancier meal . The parents do n ' t want to hurry through the meal but talk to each other . They do not have bored children pestering them about leaving . That ' s no fun for kids either . For them , going to a nicer restaurant means just one thing : sit still and be quiet . On family blogs across the Web , dozens of parents post the same question all the time ; are there any nicer restaurants with play areas for kids ? Research shows that some nicer restaurants do have play areas . In warmer cities , it is easier for restaurants to build play areas outside . For example , at one restaurant kids can sail tiny little motor boats in a small , shallow pond . Parents can sit on a beautiful yard and watch the kids play . Some nicer restaurants even have indoor play areas . Research also shows that these restaurants serve more than just burgers , chickens and fries . So , it ' s possible for a restaurant to provide both food and a place where kids can play .
