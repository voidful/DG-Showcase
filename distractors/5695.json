{"id": "5695", "article": "From a very early age , some children show better self - control than others . Now , a new study that began with about 1 , 000 children in New Zealand has tracked how a child ' s low self - control can predict poor health , money troubles and even a criminal record in their adult years . Researchers have been studying this group of children for decades now . They observed the level of self - control the youngsters displayed . Parents , teachers , even the kids themselves , scored the youngsters on measures like \" acting before thinking \" and \" Persistence in reaching goals . \" The study led by Moffitt of Duke University and colleagues followed 1 , 000 children from birth to age 32 in Dunedin , New Zealand . \" The children who had the lowest self - control when they were age three to ten , later on had the most health problems in their 30s , \" Moffitt said , \" and they had the worst financial situation . They were more likely to have a criminal record and to be raising a child as a single parent on a very low income . \" Moffitt explained that self - control problems were widely observed , and were n ' t just a feature of a small group of misbehaving kids . Moffitt said it ' s still unclear why some children have better self - control than others , though she said other researchers have found that it ' s mostly a learned behavior , with relatively little genetic influence . But good self - control can be set to run in families because children with good self - control are more likely to grow up to be healthy and prosperous parents . But the good news , Moffitt said , is that self - control can be taught by parents , and through school curricula that have been shown to be effective .", "questions": "Which of the following might be the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["children ' s self - control needs to be improved", "child ' s self - control predicts future health and success", "child ' s self - control can be taught by parents", "children ' s self - control habits"], "human": ["Kids are encouraged to take risks at an early age", "Children ' s development can not be changed by teachers", "How to teach the kids a bit of self - control in schools", "Child ' s self - control predicts future health and success"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
