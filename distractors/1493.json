{"id": "1493", "article": "Football is , I believe , the most popular game in England : one has only to go to the important matches to see _ . Rich and poor , young and old , one can see them all there , shouting for one side or the other . To a stranger , one of the most surprising things about football in England is the great knowledge of the game which even the smallest boy seems to have . He can tell you the names of the players in most of the important teams . He will tell you who he expects will win such a match , and his opinion is usually as good as that of men three or four times his age . Most schools in England take football seriously - much more seriously than nearly all European schools , where lessons are all very important and games are left for the children themselves . In England it is believed that education is not only a matter filling a boy ' s mind with facts in the classroom : education also means the training of character ; and one of the best ways of training character is by means of games , especially team games ; where a boy or girl has to learn to work with others for his or her team , instead of working for oneself alone . The school therefore plans games and matches for its students . Football is a good team game . It is good both for the body and the mind . That ' s why it is every school ' s game in England .", "questions": "In passage 1 , by \" this \" the author means", "options": {"model": ["football is the most popular game in england", "football is more important than lessons in england", "football is a good sport for the students", "football is very important in england"], "human": ["people often go to football games .", "people , rich and poor , young and old , play football", "people usually shout at each other in a football match", "football is the most popular game in England"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
