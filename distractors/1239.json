{"id": "1239", "article": "Are you feeling blue ? An American study suggests that being surrounded by happy friends and neighbours could have more of an effect on your happiness than money . That is the finding of researchers from Harvard University and the University of California at San Diego . Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler studied the emotional health of more than 4 , 700 people . They used information from the Framingham Heart Study . That study began sixty years ago in the American community of Framingham . Massachusetts . It was started to learn more about the risks of heart attack and stroke . For the new study , the researchers examined the emotions of the men and women in the Framingham Heart Study . The information was gathered from 1983 to 2003 . The researchers found that friends of happy people had a greater chance of being happy themselves . That means that happiness spreads , or has a contagious effect , among people . And , the smaller the physical distance between friends , the larger the effect they had on each other ' s happiness . Sadness was also contagious among friends , but not as much as happiness . The researchers say social groups did not influence happiness as much as personal situations . However , people removed by as much as three degrees of separation still had an effect on one ' s happiness . The expression three degrees of separation means the friends of an individual ' s friends . In fact , persons with three degrees of separation had a greater effect on an individual ' s happiness than having five thousand dollars . The researchers say the study is historic because it shows that social effects on health can be spread among people . Another finding is that people who work together or are married do not have as much of an effect on happiness levels as friends . The researchers say this is often true among friends of the same sex .", "questions": "Why do the researchers do this study ?", "options": {"model": ["they believe that happiness affects one ' s mental health .", "they want to know more about happiness .", "they want to learn about social effects on health ."], "human": ["They want to learn about the importance of having friends .", "They want to find a way to let people get rid of depression .", "They want to learn about social effects on health ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
