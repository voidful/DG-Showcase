{"id": "2456", "article": "Of all the areas of learning the most important is the development of attitudes . Emotional reactions as well as logical thought processes affect the behavior of most people . \" The burnt child fears the fire \" is one instance ; another is the rise of figures like Hitler . Both these examples point up the fact that attitudes come from experience . In the one case the experience was direct and impressive ; in the other it was indirect and gradual . The classroom teacher in the elementary school is in strategic position to influence attitudes . This is true partly because children acquire attitudes from those adults whose word they respect . Another reason it is true is that pupils often search somewhat deeply into a subject in school that has only been touched upon at home or has possibly never occurred to them before . To a child who has previously acquire little knowledge of Mexico , his teacher ' s method of handling such a unit would greatly affect his attitude toward Mexicans . The teacher can develop proper attitudes through social studies , science matters , the very atmosphere of the classroom , etc . However , when children come to school with undesirable attitudes , it is unwise to attempt to change their feelings by criticizing them . The teacher can achieve the proper effect by helping them obtain constructive experience . To illustrate , first - grade pupils , afraid of policemen will probably change their attitudes after a classroom talk with the neighborhood officer in which he explains how he protects them . In the same way , a class of older children can develop attitudes through discussion , research , outside reading and all - day trips . Finally , a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes , because her influence can be harmful she has personal prejudices . This is especially true in respect to controversial issues and questions of which children should be encouraged to reach their own decisions as result of objective analysis of all the facts .", "questions": "The main readers of this passage may be", "options": {"model": ["teachers of school", "school teachers"], "human": ["parents who have children in school", "school teachers"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
