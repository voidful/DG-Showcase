{"id": "2893", "article": "How much rain has fallen on the earth in the past ? Man has not always kept weather records . Because scientists need a way to learn about past rainfall , they study the tree rings . A tree ' s trunk keeps growing year by year . Under its bark , a tree adds a layer of new wood each year it lives . If you look at a tree stump , you can see the layers . They are called annual ring . On some trees , all of the rings are of the same width . But the ponderosa that grows in the American southwest have rings in different withes . The soil in he southwest is dry . The pines depend on rainfall for water . In a year of good rainfall , they form wide rings . In a dry year , they form narrow ones . Scientists do not have to cut down a pine to study its rings . With a special tool , they remove a narrow piece of wood from the trunk without harming the tree . Then they look at the width of each ring to see how much rain fell in the year it formed . Some pines are hundreds of years old and have hundreds of rings . These rings are from an annual record o0f past rainfall in the southwest .", "questions": "We could infer from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["a tree grows faster when it has a lot of water", "a tree does n ' t have a long history of over 20 years", "a tree has many rings"], "human": ["scientists cut down trees to study tree rings", "pine trees form rings of he same width every year", "a tree grows faster when it has a lot of water"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
