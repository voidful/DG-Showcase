{"id": "2885", "article": "The class teacher thought that hobbies were very important for every child . She encouraged all her pupils to have one , and sometimes arranged for their parents to come and see the work they had done as a result . One Friday morning the teacher told the class that those of them who had a hobby could have a holiday that afternoon to get the things they had made as parts of their hobbies ready for their parents to see the following afternoon . So on Friday afternoon , while those of the pupils who had nothing to show did their usual lessons , the lucky ones who had made something were allowed to go home , on condition that they returned before five o ' clock to bring what they were going to show , and to arrange them . When the afternoon lessons began , the teacher was surprised to see that Tommy was not there . He was the laziest boy in the class , and the teacher found it difficult to believe that he had a hobby . However , at a quarter to five , Tommy arrived with a beautiful collection of butterflies in glass cases . After his teacher had admired them and helped him to arrange them on a table in the classroom , she was surprised to see Tommy pick them up again and begin to leave . \" What are you doing , Tommy ? \" She asked . \" Those things must remain here until tomorrow afternoon . That ' s when the parents are coming to see them . \" \" I know they are coming then , \" answered Tommy , \" and I will bring them back tomorrow , but my big brother does n ' t want them to be out of our house at night in case they are stolen . \" \" But what has it got to do with your big brother ? \" asked the teacher , \" Are n ' t the butterflies yours ? \" \" No , \" answered Tommy . \" They belong to him . \" \" But Tommy , you are supposed to show your own hobby here , not somebody else ' s ! \" said the teacher . \" I know that , \" answered Tommy , \" My hobby is watching my brother collecting butterflies . \"", "questions": "The teacher", "options": {"model": ["did n ' t like the teacher ' s hobby", "invited the parents to come and see what the pupils had made", "told the teacher that the butterflies were not as useful as tommy", "asked tommy to do so"], "human": ["asked her pupils to bring something they had made that Saturday afternoon", "was certain that her pupils were good at making things , so she wanted to show them to the parents .", "allowed the pupils who had hobbies not to go to class that Friday afternoon", "invited the parents to come and see what the pupils had made"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
