{"id": "1159", "article": "I do a lot of hiking . And I can step out of my house and within minutes reach a beautiful forest where I walk for exercise every day . I see many photography subjects such as parrots , snakes , hares , big trees and flowers . There are so many different flowers around my place that once I decided to see how many types I could count in a onehourlong walk , and I counted over 100 . Needless to say , as a keen amateur photographer , I always take a camera with me . I have three favorites : a Pentax Optio RZ10 , a Sony Alpha 390 and a Panasonic Lumix FZ100 . I mostly take the Pentax pocket camera with me . This Pentax pocket camera takes images as good as those from much more expensive Single Lens Reflex cameras . It allows you to get to just 1 cm from the subject , and these images are of astonishing clarity . I can stick the camera right into a flower . And the photo shows fantastic details . The Pentax is also good at taking landscapes . The color is natural and price again the details even of distant objects are great . Sometimes , even when I have one of my other cameras with me , I still just use the Pentax pocket camera . About half of all the images on my website were taken with the Pentax . The Pentax takes quality images in poor light and the zoom works well . You have to work hard to get a blurry shot . This is an especially good feature at parties and gatherings . You get fantastic photos of people . You do n ' t have to wait for them to keep still . Keep this camera in your pocket or in the car . It takes up little room ; it ' s light and you ' ll never regret it !", "questions": "We can infer from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["the pentax has a special effect on the camera", "it is good to take a quick photo with the pentax"], "human": ["the author took blurry photos at gatherings", "it is good to take a quick photo with the Pentax"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
