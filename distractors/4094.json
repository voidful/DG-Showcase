{"id": "4094", "article": "I am a mother of two children . Like many other parents , I worry that my children watch too much TV . Why ? First , there are lots of bad programmes on TV . They may learn from them . Second , watching too much TV is bad for their eyes . Many students wear glasses because they watch TV for long hours . Third , watching too much TV makes children think little . I think it is very important for children to read some books . Reading books makes children think more .

Maybe it is a good idea .", "questions": "What is the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["a mother ' s worry", "children ' s tv", "watching tv is bad for children"], "human": ["Bad programmes on TV", "Do n ' t read books .", "A mother ' s worry"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
