{"id": "3922", "article": "The Albinas married when Mr . Albina was 30 , and they spent the early marriage in Argentina . Then they decided to move to Chile , which meant they had to cross the Andes Mountains . They and their 20s sons made the difficult two - week journey on horses . One night there was a terrible snow storm in the mountains , during which Mrs Albina gave birth to triplets , a boy and two girls . Mrs Albina now has 30 more girls , including the twins who are 15 months old . The oldest Albina children are in their 30s and 40s . They are on their own now , but 18 of the kids still live with their parents in a two - room house . The house has electricity but no toilet or running water . Clearly , the Albinas do n ' t have enough money and food for the big family . Why , then , do they continue to have children ? The Albinas do not use birth control because it is against their religion . They can let other people take care of their kids , but Mrs Albina does n ' t allow it . \" When we were babies , \" she said , \" our mother left us at an orphanage and never returned . Then a couple adopted my brothers , and I was left behind . I was heartbroken . I promised that when I became a mother I would never give my children away . \" So the Albina family continues to grow . They have so many kids that they run out of names and have to give some children the same name . There are three Susannas , three Miriams , two Estrellas , and two Soledades . Will the family stop at 53 kids ? Mr Albina is 77 , and Mrs Albina is 59 . \" I am getting old , \" she said with a smile , \" and I would like God to think of me and consider my age . But if God sends more children to me , yes , there will be more . \"", "questions": "It can be inferred from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["mrs albina experienced a hard childhood", "the albras do n ' t have enough money and food", "the albinos do n ' t use birth control", "the albinos do n ' t have enough money and food for the big family"], "human": ["the Albinas would like to use birth control", "ten kids in the family share the same name", "the Albina family has lived in three countries", "Mrs Albina experienced a hard childhood"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
