The German rail operator has launched a bicycle - hire scheme designed for simple one - way trips . \" It ' s a new concept , \" said Andreas Knie , head of the project . Users must first register with Call - A - Bike at a cost of 15 euros ( US $ 14 . 7 ) . With a simple phone call , they can hire one of the many bikes parked outside stations , at a cost of 3 to 5 cents per minute . At the end of their journey , they ring a computer and tell it where the bike is parked . The bikes are available 24 hours a day , seven days a week . No one will be breaking speed records with Call - A - Bike bicycles . They weigh in at 25 kilograms , at least double the weight of a normal bicycle , though they do have eight gears . \" They are pretty heavy , but we do n ' t want people taking them on the train or into the subway , \" Knie said .

Vandalism and theft have led to the downfall of previous schemes which date back toAmsterdam ' s 1966 \" White Bike \" scheme .
