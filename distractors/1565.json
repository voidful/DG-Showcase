{"id": "1565", "article": "The associates I hired in my bicycle and lawn mower shop like myself were never perfect ; however , they were excellent . Working with them as they improved taught me new ways to show forgiveness , understanding , and patience . One day the placement officer asked me to interview a young man who was having trouble finding a job . He told me that David was a little shy , did not talk much and was afraid to go on with interviews . He requested that I give David an interview just for practice . He plainly told David that I had no positions open at the time and the interview was just for practice . [ : ] When David came in for the interview , he hardly said a word . I told him what we did at the bicycle shop and showed him around . I told David to keep showing up because the number one thing an employer wanted in an associate was dependability . David was very quiet ( he was evaluated as a slow learner in school ) . Every ten days or so , for weeks after the interview , David walked into the bicycle shop and stood by the front door . He never said a word , just stood by the door . [ : , , Z , X , X , K ] One day , shortly before Christmas , a large truck came to the shop , packed with 250 new bicycles . It had to be unloaded right away or the driver would leave . It was raining . Some of my workers ( without physical limitations ) chose not to brave the weather to get into work , so I was short - handed . It seemed everything was going wrong and on top of it , David came in the front door and just stood there . I looked at him and shouted , \" Well , all right ! Fill out a time card and help me unload this truck ! \" David worked for my bicycle shop for eighteen years . He came to work every day thirty minutes early . He could talk ; however , he rarely chose to . He drove my truck and made deliveries . The customers would praise David , saying , \" He does n ' t talk , but he really shows you how to operate a lawn mower ! \"", "questions": "The author finally hired David because", "options": {"model": ["he needed someone who was kind to him", "he needed a job for his bicycle shop", "he needed someone who was willing to work then", "he did n ' t like david ' s speech"], "human": ["there were no other workers in the shop then", "David kept showing up", "he realized David was dependable", "he needed someone who was willing to work then"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
