{"id": "3780", "article": "When I looked at the grade on my math paper my jaw almost dropped to the ground : a big \" 65 \" in bright red ink . I had never received such a terrible grade before . I was so ashamed that when I got home that afternoon I lied to my dad . I told him I got 85 and that the report would n ' t come until the end of the month . Dad smiled . His daughter would never lie about her grade , so he did n ' t doubt the unusual delay of my report . A month later , Dad casually asked me again about the report at the dinner table . He looked right into my eyes and asked for an answer . Having no choice , I told him that I had in fact got just 65 in my math final . I had lied because I did n ' t want to let him down . For a moment , he just looked at me . I would have preferred a telling off than that silence . Finally , Dad said , in a hurt voice , \" You have already let me down , with your lie . I am not disappointed at your math score . That is no big deal - no one can be perfect all the time . But I am very disappointed in you . If you ca n ' t be honest with your dad , who can you be honest with ? It ' s much easier to achieve a better grade than rebuild someone else ' s trust in you . \" Dad ' s words touched my heart . I could n ' t forgive myself for having hurt his feelings . I took out the report that I had been hiding for weeks , handed to him and apologized , sincerely . I realized that my honesty is not only important to me personally , but to those around me that truly care about my well - being . In one of Shakespeare ' s plays a character says : \" No legacy is so rich as honesty . \" After the crisis between Dad and me , I began to understand those words .", "questions": ".
