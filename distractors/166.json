{"id": "166", "article": "I remember a day when I was a little kid . I was making a sandwich in the kitchen when I noticed the date on one of the wine bottles . \" Dad , dad ! \" I cried . \" This wine is too old to drink . \" \" Son , hold on , \" he said . \" No , you ca n ' t drink this tonight ! This bottle of wine was made 10 years ago . \" \" Wait , let me tell you . . . \" \" Would you like me to throw it away fro you ? \" I asked . \" Son , wait a second , \" he said . \" Son , some wines get better over time . The longer you wait to drink it , the better it will be . Although this may seem strange , it is true . \" When I was young , I did n ' t have any understanding of what this meant , but now , this would have been very helpful to remember as I went through my teenage years . In our society , we forget this simple rule : The longer you want for certain things , the better they will be . But we want the best job as quickly as possible ; we want to graduate from college in as few years as possible ; we even speed through our homework just to chat with friends . When we do this , we lose something of great importance . We all want to get to the next step so quickly that perhaps we do n ' t get ready enough to get there . This has a negative effect on our society . When trying to go to the right college , we will do anything to get in and when we rush through our class - work , we may not study enough for the test , and end up failing . We need to be ready for whatever comes , ready for the unexpected . Wine gets better over time , so do the things in our paths of life .", "questions": "What the author ' s father said", "options": {"model": ["did n ' t mean anything to the young .", "made the author puzzled when he was a little child ."], "human": ["was an excuse to drink the wine .", "made the author puzzled when he was a little child ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
