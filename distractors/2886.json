{"id": "2886", "article": "The class teacher thought that hobbies were very important for every child . She encouraged all her pupils to have one , and sometimes arranged for their parents to come and see the work they had done as a result . One Friday morning the teacher told the class that those of them who had a hobby could have a holiday that afternoon to get the things they had made as parts of their hobbies ready for their parents to see the following afternoon . So on Friday afternoon , while those of the pupils who had nothing to show did their usual lessons , the lucky ones who had made something were allowed to go home , on condition that they returned before five o ' clock to bring what they were going to show , and to arrange them . When the afternoon lessons began , the teacher was surprised to see that Tommy was not there . He was the laziest boy in the class , and the teacher found it difficult to believe that he had a hobby . However , at a quarter to five , Tommy arrived with a beautiful collection of butterflies in glass cases . After his teacher had admired them and helped him to arrange them on a table in the classroom , she was surprised to see Tommy pick them up again and begin to leave . \" What are you doing , Tommy ? \" She asked . \" Those things must remain here until tomorrow afternoon . That ' s when the parents are coming to see them . \" \" I know they are coming then , \" answered Tommy , \" and I will bring them back tomorrow , but my big brother does n ' t want them to be out of our house at night in case they are stolen . \" \" But what has it got to do with your big brother ? \" asked the teacher , \" Are n ' t the butterflies yours ? \" \" No , \" answered Tommy . \" They belong to him . \" \" But Tommy , you are supposed to show your own hobby here , not somebody else ' s ! \" said the teacher . \" I know that , \" answered Tommy , \" My hobby is watching my brother collecting butterflies . \"", "questions": "After reading the passage the readers will laugh .
