{"id": "1144", "article": "Grandma Moses is among the most famous twentieth - century painters of the United States , yet she did not start painting until she was in her late seventies . As she once said to herself : \" I would never sit back in a rocking chair , waiting for someone to help me . \" No one could have had a more productive old age . She was born Anna Mary Robertson on a farm in New York State , one of five boys and five girls . At twelve she left home and was in domestic service until , at twenty - seven , she married Thomas Moses , the hired hand of one of her employers . They farmed most of their lives , first in Virginia and then in New York State , at Eagle Bridge . She had ten children , of whom five survived ; her husband died in 1927 . Grandma Moses painted a little as a child and made embroidery pictures as a hobby , but only changed to oils in old age because her hands had become too stiff to sew and she wanted to keep busy and pass the time . Her pictures were first sold at the local drugstore and at a market and were soon noticed by a businessman who bought everything she painted . Three of the pictures exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art , and in 1940 she had her first exhibition in New York . Between the 1930 ' s and her death , she produced some 2 , 000 pictures : detailed and lively _ of the country life she had known for so long , with a wonderful sense of color and form . \" I think really hard till I think of something really pretty , and then I paint it \" she said .", "questions": "Which of the following would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["grandma moses ' life and art .", "grandma moses and other artists .", "grandma moses : her life and pictures .", "grandma moses and other older old age ."], "human": ["The Children of Grandma Moses .", "Grandma Moses : Her Best Exhibition .", "Grandma Moses and Other Older Artists .", "Grandma Moses : Her Life and Pictures ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
