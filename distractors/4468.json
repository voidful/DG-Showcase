But can you imagine that a tree can talk and share news too ? Of course , no tree moves _ and says words just as people do . Strange as it may sound , though , some trees do manage to communicate with each other . Willow trees are the best - known of these trees . When insects begin nibbling a willow tree , the tree sends out a special smell at once . This smell tells the other willows that harmful insects are coming near . All of them quickly make a chemical in their leaves . This chemical is bad to the insects . The insects do not like it and they fly away soon . In this way , the willow trees protect themselves from the insects . The next time when you take a walk in the woods , maybe the trees are \" talking \" to each other quietly . And when someone says that trees can not \" talk \" , please tell them that even trees give messages to each other , too .", "questions": "The passage tells us that some of the trees can", "options": {"model": ["communicate with each other", "give messages to each other"], "human": ["kill insects in the woods", "communicate with each other"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
