{"id": "2903", "article": "Some futurologists have assumed that the vast upsurge of women in the workforce may mean a rejection of marriage . Many women , according to this hypothesis , would rather work than marry . The converse of this concern is that becoming a multi - paycheck household could encourage marriage . In the past , only the earnings and financial prospects of the man counted in the marriage decision . Now , however , the earning ability of a woman can make her more attractive as a marriage partner . Data show that economic downturns tend to put off marriage because the parties can not afford to establish a family or are concerned about rainy days ahead . As the economy comes to life , the number of marriages also rises . The increase in divorce rates follows to the increase in women working outside the home . Yet , it may be wrong to jump to any simple cause - and - effect conclusions . The impact of a wife ' s work on divorce is no less cloudy than its impact on marriage decisions . The realization that she can be a good provider may increase the chances that a working wife will choose divorce over an unsatisfactory marriage . But the reverse is equally plausible . Tensions grounded in financial problems often play a key role in ending a marriage . By raising a family ' s standard of living , a working wife may strengthen her family ' s financial and emotional stability . Psychological factors also should be considered . For example , a wife blocked from a career outside the home may feel caged in the house . She may view her only choice as seeking a divorce . On the other hand , if she can find fulfillment through work outside the home , work and marriage can go together to create a stronger and more stable union . Also , a major part of women ' s inequality in marriage has been due to the fact that , in most cases , men have remained the main breadwinners . A working wife may rob a husband of being the master of the house . Depending upon how the couple reacts to these new conditions , it could create a stronger equal partnership or it could create new insecurities .", "questions": "Which of the following statements can best summarize the authors view in the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["a working wife may change her family ' s standard of living if she is a woman .", "the impact of the growing female workforce on marriage varies from case to case .", "a working wife may change her family ' s standard of living .", "women benefit more than men from marriage ."], "human": ["The stability of marriage and the divorce rate may reflect the economic situation of the country", "Even when economically independent , most women have to struggle for real equality in marriage", "In order to secure their marriage women should work outside the home and remain independent", "The impact of the growing female workforce on marriage varies from case to case ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
