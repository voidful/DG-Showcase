It is a pretty island that has many mountains and a pleasant climate . For a long time Bali was cut off from much of the world . The people of Bali were happy and had a peaceful way of life . They were not allowed to fight . At one time there had been terrible wars on Bali . Then the people decided it was wrong to fight and have wars . They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight . Bali was divided into seven small kingdoms . The land around each kingdom was kept empty , and no one lived there . Since the kingdoms did not share the same borders , the people could not fight about them . On Bali , even the young were not allowed to fight . If two children started a fight over a toy , someone stopped them . When two boys argued , they would agree not to speak to each other . Sometimes they did not talk to each other for months . This gave the boys a chance to forget their anger . Families who were angry with each other also promised not speak to one another . Their promise was written down , and the whole village knew about it . If they broke their promise , they had to offer presents to their gods .", "questions": "The land around each kingdom was kept empty so that", "options": {"model": ["there would be no war over borders", "there would be no wars on bali", "no one lived there"], "human": ["fights might take place outside the kingdoms", "people could not talk to each other", "there would be no war over borders"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
