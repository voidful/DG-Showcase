Bright yellow is exciting to the brain , while the color green is thought to encourage creativity . Use blue and green to calm yourself . Blue , especially , can cause you to calm down . Something blue in a reading area , for example , may help you focus on what you are reading . But too much dark blue can make you sad , so use light blue on walls or large floor areas . If you are struggling to read , try a different color of paper . According to a study , 80 percent of children who had difficulty in reading improved their understanding when they put something grey or blue over their pages . Do not use bright colors here , as they become difficult to look at after a while . However , use bright colors like red , orange and yellow for important points . These colors attract the eye and may help you notice details . The same color of the walls of a room do not help you focus on your studies , but make you slow in understanding . Colors , on the other hand , make the senses active and encourage learning . Use primary colors red , yellow and blue in a proper way . Then how do you make your choices of color ? It mainly depends on your space , the lighting and the function of the room .", "questions": "If you want to remember some important points , you may use the colors", "options": {"model": ["blue and yellow", "red and yellow", "red and blue"], "human": ["green and blue", "grey and blue", "red and yellow"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
