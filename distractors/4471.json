{"id": "4471", "article": "My teachers suggested that I see a speech specialist in school . I never really gave much thought to my speech . If other people understood what I was saying , then that was good enough . I did n ' t mind repeating myself many times . Before testing me , the speech specialist asked me what I thought of having good speech . I told her I thought it was not important . \" Well , when you are in an interview for a job , and they do n ' t know what you are saying , what are they going to say to you ? Nice meeting you , bye , \" she said . Maybe good speech was important . I took part in 20 - minute classes each week with the specialist . After she tested me , she told me that I spoke too fast , and did n ' t give enough eye contact . I learned that when I made eye contact with someone , it meant that I was talking to that person , and I could also see what he or she thought about what I was saying . When my first speech class started , I found that I had been speaking too fast to be understood . Every time I spoke too fast , the specialist stopped me and told me to start again . At first , I got stopped after almost every other sentence . After a while , I felt my speech slow down . I was n ' t sure if people could understand me better , but my friends stopped asking me to repeat myself . Speech is an important skill to have . If you do have good speech , that ' s a good thing , but if you do n ' t have it , it is never too late to improve .", "questions": "Through the passage , the writer wants to tell us that", "options": {"model": ["speech is an important skill to have", "good speech is important", "a good speech is important to everyone", "speech is an important skill to have a good speech"], "human": ["seeing a speech specialist is necessary", "good speech can help you make friends", "good speech gets good affect", "speech is an important skill to have"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
