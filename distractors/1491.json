{"id": "1491", "article": "Look closely at , your hands - are they clean ? It does n ' t matter how many times you was your hands . They ' re still crowded with microbes , which are also called \" germs \" or \" bacteria \" . Microbes are everywhere . But do n ' t worry - most microbes do n ' t harm you . and many actually help you stay alive . Now , scientists say the microbes that live on our hands could be used in a surprising way : fighting crime . When police visit the scene of a crime , they often look for fingerprints to try to identifythe criminal . But according to a recent study , investigators could even use microbes to help break a criminal case . Every person has his or her own set of microbes that live on their hands , according to scientists at , the University of : Colorado . That means the mix of different kinds of microbes on everybody ' s hand is unique - much like one ' s fingerprint . The scientists wanted to know whether this microbe mix could be used as a new kind of fingerprint - especially in a crime scene where fingerprints might be hard to find . And policemen use forensics such as studying fingerprints to identify the criminal . \" Microbe fingerprints are harder to hide , \" said Noah Fierer , one of the scientists . \" You ca n ' t sterilize ( . . . . . . ) a surface just by wiping it off . \" His team compared the bacteria on the hands of 273 people with the bacteria found on each person ' s computer keyboard . For the study , the keyboards had been used only by the people who were being tested . The study showed that the mix of microbes from each per - son ' s hands matched the mix of microbes on that person ' s keyboard . The scientists were easily able to tell the 273 people apart - just by looking at their keyboards . But there are a lot more than 273 criminals . Other scientists wonder whetherthe microbe fingerprint can really be that useful . Fierer agrees that scientists have a lot more work to do before the microbe fingerprint will be a useful tool .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["your microbes may give you away", "the microbe fingerprint can be used as a new kind of fingerprint", "the bacteria on your hands can be found on your computer", "the bacteria on your hands can not be found by the researchers"], "human": ["scientists will come to a clear conclusion soon", "many scientists think microbe fingerprints useless", "the microbe fingerprint has been used in many cases", "your microbes may give you away"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
