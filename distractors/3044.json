{"id": "3044", "article": "\" Drink your milk . It ' s good for you ! \" You ' ve probably heard that many times , and it ' s true . Milk contains calcium , which is necessary for keeping bones and teeth healthy and strong . The US government even requires milk as part of the National School Lunch Program , saying that students should drink one cup of fat - free or low - fat milk every meal . However , a group of doctors asked the government to take it away from the lunch program . The US ' Physician Committee for Responsible Medicine ( PCRM ) says , \" Milk is high in sugar , fat and animal protein , \" all of which have negative effects on health . The PCRM says there are better and healthier ways to get calcium such as eating beans , broccoli , cereals and tofu . Orange juice and soymilk that have calcium added to them also supply the nutrient . \" One of the only reasons people prefer milk is that it is going to help build strong bones , \" says Dr Neal Barnard , president of the PCRM . But milk may not be the best way to get calcium your body needs . Of course , calcium is important for healthy bones and teeth , but there are other things that affect your bone strength , such as genes , how much vitamin D you take in , and getting an hour ' s worth of exercise every day . Some people disagree with the idea that milk is n ' t important . Keri Gans , an American Dietitian , says \" I do n ' t think it ' s irresponsible to take this beverage that children enjoy it very much , especially among those who are unable to meet their nutrient needs for the day , and remove it from the lunch line . \" The U . S government is now considering the request of the PCRM , but a decision may be a long way off . Meanwhile , Marion Nestle , a professor puts it best : \" Milk certainly has nutrients . Other food has the same nutrients . It ' s just food . As with other food , too much might be a problem . \"", "questions": "The U .
