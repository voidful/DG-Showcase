{"id": "3754", "article": "The life - long benefits of teaching children good money habits make it well worth the effort . Children who are not taught these lessons pay the consequences for a life time . Some parents do n ' t teach children about money because they think they should n ' t talk about money with children , do n ' t have the time , or think they do n ' t have enough money . Parents should take the time to teach children about money regardless of their income and should start when children are young . Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money , based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families . Most often , these experiences , values , and beliefs are different for each parent . It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money . Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children : Advise rather than order how the child ' s money should be used . Allow children to learn by mistakes and by successes . Be consistent while taking children ' s differences into account . Include all family members in money management discussions , decision making , and activities suitable for their age . Explan to children what they can and can not do and the consequences of going above the limits . As children get older increasingly include them in discussions of limits and consequences . Expect all family members to perform unpaid , routine household work based on their abilities . Express your desire to have things you ca n ' t afford . Children need to know that parents say \" no \" to themselves , too .", "questions": "Some parents do n ' t teach their children good money habits , because", "options": {"model": ["they believe money is an adult thing", "they do n ' t care about money", "they do n ' t believe money is a thing", "they do n ' t have enough money"], "human": ["they do n ' t have money for their children to spend", "they think miney is too serious for children", "they think children can learn naturally", "they believe money is an adult thing"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
