{"id": "5332", "article": "Now scientists believe that global warming affects hibernating animals , causing them to wake up earlier . While this may seem a little concern , it is in fact a serious environmental problem . The shortened hibernation period could actually lead to significant decreases in the population of several species . Some of the first evidence of the problem came from Colorado , where researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab have been observing marmot hibernation behavior since the 1970s . In the early days of their studies , marmots generally hibernated several weeks into the month of May . Nowadays , however , temperatures in the area have risen by 2 . 5 degrees Fahrenheit , and the marmots wake up about a month earlier . At least the marmots are still hibernating . Several other animals have not been hibernating at all recently . Brown bears in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains did not hibernate last year . Chipmunks in the US and some snakes in Australia also skipped the hibernation period . The bears seem to have survived without losing many individuals . The chipmunks and snakes , however , were not so lucky . Many of the animals died of starvation during the winter . The problem with animals waking up early , or skipping hibernation altogether , lies with the creatures ' metabolism . When the animals hibernate , their metabolism drops significantly . The animals ' heart rate slows , and they require very little energy to live . When the animals awake in the spring , their metabolism returns to normal . But while their metabolism may be as active as it was before hibernation , food sources are n ' t as available as they were before . A marmot may wake up when temperatures get warmer , thinking it ' s spring , but plants will not have got the amount of sun they need to grow . So until the plants grow , the marmots have no reliable food source . Many scientists believe the problem will continue to get worse . For many biologists , that ' s a scary prospect . Terry Root , an animal expert at Stanford University , said , \" I do think what we will be facing is the extinction of many species . \"", "questions": "What is the viewpoint of the writer ?", "options": {"model": ["a marmot is a serious problem because of the lack of food .", "waking up early in spring may lead to the extinction of some animals .", "a marmot is a serious problem for some animals ' growth ."], "human": ["Shortened hibernation will definitely decrease the population of animals .", "Animals which do not hibernate die of starvation .", "Waking up early in spring may lead to the extinction of some animals ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
