After high school , he wanted to join the U . S . Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight . However , his dream remained . At the age of 33 , Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles . One day , while sitting outside in his garden , he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him : to use balloons to fly . A few weeks later , Ted bought 42 huge balloons . He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer , sandwiches and a gun . His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden , enjoy a few hours in the air , and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down . But things did not go as he planned . Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted ' s chair , the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair . He did n ' t shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee of his \" plane \" . Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours , cold and frightened . Planes heading towards Los Angeles ' busy international airport reported the strange sight . And Ted ' s balloons caused great danger to them . At last , Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground , where many policemen were waiting for him . Ted made his dream come true , but it cost him : he was fined $ 1 , 500 for breaking the law about air safety .
