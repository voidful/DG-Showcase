{"id": "3469", "article": "Fannie Cratty was n ' t really my aunt . I only referred to her as \" My Aunt Fannie \" because the name always made my father laugh and gave my mother cause to look angrily at both of us - - - at me for being disrespectful of my elder and at my father for encouraging my bad behavior . As a young woman , my mother had worked in the kitchen of a large Victorian farmhouse owned by Fannie Cratty . During those years my mother helped Aunt Fannie make the best blueberry jam ever tasted by anyone in Glenfield . Aunt Fannie was well known for her jam and for never sharing the recipe with another living soul . Even though my mother knew the recipe by heart , as long as Aunt Fannie was alive ( and she lived to be ninety - six ! ) , she never made the jam without Ms . Cratty in our kitchen to direct the process and preserve the secret . Each August , when blueberry season would roll around , my mother would prepare me for Aunt Fannie ' s visit . It was vital that I should be on my best behavior . After all , the woman was old , wealthy , very strict with children . Whenever she was at the house , I did n ' t need to be reminded to guard my thoughts and watch my tongue . One year , after I had been particularly helpful with the jam process , Aunt Fannie gave me a quarter ( 25 ) and then made me promise that I would never spend it . \" Hold onto this quarter , \" she said , \" and someday you will be rich . I still have my very first quarter , given to me by my grandfather . \" It had obviously worked for her . So , I kept the 1938 - quarter into a small box , put it in my dresser drawer , and waited to become rich . I now have the blueberry jam recipe and the quarter from Aunt Fannie . In people ' s eye Aunt Fannie ' s success was due to that secret recipe . But to me , it was just a common recipe . Neither has significantly contributed to my wealth , but I keep them as reminders to hold onto the valuable things in life . Money can make you feel rich for a while , but it is the relationships and the memories of time spent with friends and family that truly leave you wealthy . And that is a fortune that anyone can build .", "questions": "The author thinks that we can feel wealthy if we", "options": {"model": ["own lasting love and friendship", "spend much time with friends and family"], "human": ["know the secret of a jam recipe", "own lasting love and friendship"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
