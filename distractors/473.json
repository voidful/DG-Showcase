{"id": "473", "article": "More than 2 . 25 billion cups of coffee are drunk throughout the world each day , and it ' s likely that many taste bitter . Now , a new study suggests that coffee fans can make their drink sweeter by changing the color of their cups . Researchers from Oxford set out to prove whether the claim that coffee drunk from a white cup tastes biter was true . They used 36 volunteers and three different colored cups - - - blue , white and transparent glass - - - to examine the claim . In one experiment , the white cup increased the intensity of the coffee taste relative to the transparent cup . Then , in a second experiment , coffee drunk from the white cup was found to taste less sweet when compared to the other colored cups , while the blue cup made the coffee taste the sweetest . The scientists believe that the color brown may be associated with bitterness , and coffee in a white cup appears the brownest . \" Our study clearly shows that the color of a cup does influence our sense of the coffee taste , \" leading author Dr George Doorn , wrote in an article for The Conversation . \" The effect of the color of the cup on the taste of the coffee reported here suggests that cafe owners should carefully consider the color of their cups , \" he said . \" The potential effects may spell the difference between a one - time purchase and a return customer . \" Actually , the idea that color can change the food and drink taste came out many years ago . A study published last year reported that red , strawberry - flavored cake served on a white plate was rated as 10 percent sweeter than the same food presented on a black plate .", "questions": "In which cup will coffee taste the sweetest ?", "options": {"model": ["a blue cup .", "a white cup .", "a white cup", "the white cup ."], "human": ["A white cup .", "A transparent cup", "A brown cup", "A blue cup ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
