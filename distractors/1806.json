{"id": "1806", "article": "In the 1950s , a family who owned a farm near Beulah , Michigan kept a bull chained to an elm . The bull paced around the tree , dragging the heavy iron chain , which led to a groove in the bark . The groove deepened over the years , though for whatever reason , it did not kill the tree . After some years , the family took their bull away . They cut the chain , leaving the loop around the tree and one link hanging down . Then one year , agricultural disaster struck Michigan in the form of Dutch Elm Disease . All of the elms lining the road leading to the farm became infected and died . Everyone thought that the old elm would be next . The farm ' s owners considered doing the safe thing : pulling it out and cutting it up into firewood before it died . But they simply could not bring themselves to do it . It was as if the old tree had become a family friend . So they decided to _ . Amazingly , the tree did not die . Nobody could understand why it was the only elm that was still standing in the country ! Plant pathologists from Michigan State University came out to observe the tree . They observed the scar left by the iron chain , now almost completely covered by bark . The plant experts decided that it was the chain that saved the elm ' s life . They reasoned that the tree must have absorbed so much iron from the chain that it became immune to the fungus . It ' s said that what does n ' t kill you will make you stronger . Or , as Ernest Hemimgway put it , \" Life breaks us all , but afterwards , many of us are strongest at the broken places . \"", "questions": "From the passage we can learn that the old elm was saved by", "options": {"model": ["the iron remaining in it", "the wood in it"], "human": ["the fungus in the tree", "the iron remaining in it"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
