After meeting with an effective leader it is not unusual to feel uplifted , inspired , and motivated to work towards a common goal . An effective leader makes others feel good about themselves , as well as the work they are doing . The leader has a vision of what he or she wants to achieve , and can communicate that vision to others in a way that makes people want to be part of it . One thing a good leader typically does is to communicate the big picture , so that each employee can see how the particular role he or she plays makes a contribution to the final result . Good leaders are positive and optimistic when they speak about the future . Their enthusiasm wins them plenty of supporters who help make their vision a reality . Good leaders also understand that different people are motivated by different things . For employees motivated by a need for achievement , a leader explains how the task offers an opportunity to take on a challenge with an achievable goal . And employees are motivated by hearing how they will be part of a team of people working together . Good leaders will introduce employees by name first , rather than job titles . They refer to employees as team members , companions , or colleagues , never as \" servants \" . Words have power , including the power to make people feel whether or not they are important to the success of an organization . Good leaders believe that every team member matters and set up environments that make everyone feel important . It is no wonder they can attract the support they need to help them achieve their goals .", "questions": "We can infer from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["a leader should be a leader as a leader", "the support of employees is necessary for a leader to reach his goal", "a leader must be a leader with a goal"], "human": ["a good leader is always good at creating comfortable working conditions", "the motivation of the employees all comes from the leader", "the support of employees is necessary for a leader to reach his goal"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
