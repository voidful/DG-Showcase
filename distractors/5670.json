{"id": "5670", "article": "A single letter written by Albert Einstein was sold for more than $ 400 , 000 . But could an e - mail printout or an electronic file reach similar heights ? That ' s the question facing those who deal in the literary artifacts of public figures , as they struggle to work out how to do business in the electronic world where information can be copied and spread out more easily than ever before . \" Booksellers , collectors and libraries are already trading in digital objects , \" Joan Winterkorn , a researcher told people . When Emory University Library bought author Slaman Rushdie ' s archives in 2006 , it received a desktop computer , three laptops , a hard drive and a smart phone along with his paper flies . And the writer John Updike , who died last month , started using computers in the 1980s , Winterkorn pointed out , so his \" papers \" will include a big store of electronic documents . So far , however , digital archives have been traded as just a small part of a larger , mainly paper - based archive . Indeed , no one is quite sure how much the digital documents of a historical figure are worth . _ \" said Gabriel Heaton , a literary manuscript specialist , adding that more tangible digital objects were easier for auctioneers to price and sell , \" What about a laptop ? For example , the one used by J . K . Rowling to write Harry Potter and the Philosopher ' s Stone in an Edinburgh cafe has real value , \" he said . \" Because she used it . \" Even if the hard drive had been cloned by a library , the artifact would still be valuable . Gordon Bell , from Microsoft Research , suggested that prices will actually fall to almost nothing . \" Once it ' s been copied and spread out the value is gone . It ' s just a piece of memory . \"", "questions": "What is the purpose of the example mentioned in Para . 1 ?", "options": {"model": ["to tell us how to do business in the electronic world .", "to show the importance of electronic books .", "to introduce the topic of the passage .", "to tell us how to make money by collecting books ."], "human": ["To show that some written letter are of great value .", "To get readers interested in electronic documents .", "To tell us to pay attention to public figures , artifacts .", "To introduce the topic of the passage ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
