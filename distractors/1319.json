{"id": "1319", "article": "Technology is making life easier for some dairy farmers . They use robotic systems to milk their cows . Cows are trained to follow a series of paths that lead to milking stations . Only one cow at a time can enter a station . Once inside , the cow is rewarded with food . As the cow eats , a robotic arm cleans and connects the animal to the milking machine . A few minutes later , milking is complete . The gate is opened , the cow is released and the next cow enters . The robotic systems are designed to operate 24 hours a day . The cows get to decide when they want to be milked . Cows are milked an average of about three times a day . Some are milked four to six times a day . The cows wear collars around their necks that identify them to the system . A computer keeps records on their eating and milking . A cow is released from the station if the computer decides it should not be milked . The automated system also measures the temperature and color of freshly produced milk . Milk is thrown away if it does not pass the tests . Professor Plaut believes the systems will appeal especially to the next generation of farmers . She means young people who are more interested in technology and less interested in working all the time on the farm . Still , she says the price of robotic milking systems will continue to limit their use . Doug and Tina Suhr have more than 100 cows on their family farm . Last year it became the fourth farm in southeast Minnesota to get a robotic milking system . A recent story in a local agricultural newspaper said the first robot cost 175 000 dollars . The second cost 150 000 . Doug told AgriNews that wages that would have been paid for one employee in five years will pay for one robot . He says the increase in milk production reaches a high of more than six kilograms per cow per day .", "questions": "The best title for the passage may be", "options": {"model": ["farmers in the future of robots", "letting robot milk your cow", "farmers in the world ' s new robots", "farmers and robotic systems"], "human": ["Milking cows by hand", "Improving the quality of milk", "Drinking fresh milk every day", "Letting robot milk your cow"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
