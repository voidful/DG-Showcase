{"id": "3740", "article": "International teams have spent nearly half a year looking for evidence of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane , a search that includes the hunt for the aircraft ' s so - called black box , which holds flight data that would likely explain what caused MH370 to move away from its course . But many aviation experts wonder why , in our increasingly networked world , divers are searching the Indian Ocean for a metal box when technology already exists that would enable planes to stream black box data to the ground in the event of an emergency . Black boxes have been on planes since the late 1950s , and now every commercial aircraft has two : a flight data recorder and a voice recorder . ( Although they are referred to as black boxes , they are typically orange in color , making them easier to spot in waters . ) Black box recorders are mainly used to investigate the cause of in - flight accidents . While black boxes are built to survive a crash and long - term submersion in water , it can be a real challenge to find the device if a plane has gone down in the ocean . While each box contains a beacon , the unit only has enough battery power to transmit a signal for 30 days . After the crash of Air France Flight 447 in the Atlantic Ocean in June 2009 , it took divers two years to find the black box . Pierre Jeanniot , a Canadian engineer who helped perfect black box technology about 40 years ago , feels that the device , in its current form , is \" _ \" . He started to question its effectiveness more than a decade ago , after seeing the broken pieces of the black boxes in the 2001 attacks on the World Trade towers in New York . Jeanniot is now on the advisory board of a Toronto - based firm that has built a live - streamed black box system . When a plane experiences an irregular event , the system can send streaming data off the aircraft to one of the satellites and then down to ground - based servers , where the message is interpreted and sent to the airline . It seems necessary that the loss of MH370 and other similar cases wake more people up to", "questions": "Which fact is mentioned to support aviation experts ' doubt about the effectiveness of the black box ?", "options": {"model": ["the service of the aircraft can be found in the right way .", "the black boxes can send out a signal for 30 days .", "the black boxes have been on plane for a long time .", "the beacon in the black box has limited battery power to send out a signal for 30 days ."], "human": ["MH370 ' s black box holds flight data that might explain what happened to the aircraft .", "The recorders are actually orange in color though referred to as black boxes .", "It ' s necessary for people to wake up to the weaknesses of the black box", "The beacon in the black box has limited battery power to send out a signal for 30 days ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
