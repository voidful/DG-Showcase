I must think of my best friend quickly . When I was in my university , one of my classmates sat beside me . His name is Wang Tao . He is my unforgettable friend in my life . He is good at study and handsome . Everyone knows that he is a genius of my university . He is kind hearted and is always ready to help others . But he does n ' t like others to praise him , because he think what he did is common . There is an old saying : A friend in need is a friend indeed . Wang Tao sets a good example in many parts in my life . I remembered that my mathematics was _ at that time , but he was excellent in solving mathematics questions . He often received high scores . Of course , I wished I could reach at his level . Since we talked all day long , he was patient and polite to answer my mathematics questions . Slowly , I made great progress in mathematics .
