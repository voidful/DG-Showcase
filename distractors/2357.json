{"id": "2357", "article": "Thanksgiving time came and all the relatives were gathered around the long table , or seated behind TV trays . The television was on and some folks were watching it while talking with one another . Something on television got their attention and one of the adults said , \" Listen at it ! \" Someone else replied . \" Well , if that do n ' t beat all . \" Simple phrases were spoken by folks whose language was simple and brief . They had several idioms that were just as colorful phrases and words that brightened the room and warmed the conversation . In school we were taught to speak differently . The way our relatives spoke was discouraged . Sometimes our parents would say things we were n ' t taught in school . They ' d often correct themselves , as if getting rid of a mistake . Of course we learned some of their phrases and used them . They were comfortable words to pronounce , familiar . Our father ' s side of the family was from Arkansas and Oklahoma and they spoke with the accents native to their birth states . Their voices musical and often high , it was easy to pick up that effect in our own speech and at school my brother and I were often teased for the way we spoke . Our mother ' s side of the family came from Illinois and they had a tendency to talk fast . They had an accent , too , and my brother and I added that to our own speech , confusing the kids at school all the more . Our father ' s side of the family loved to laugh and have a good time . Our mother ' s side of the family was more serious about how they took life in ; their joys more silently experienced and enjoyed . It was a rich picture of culture and it gave my brother and me a colorful view in life . Thanksgiving holiday was always an easy comfortable going day . It was the first real holiday of the season when everyone came together in one place , and a good time was spent happily together by all .", "questions": "From the text we can know that", "options": {"model": ["parents tried to avoid affecting their kids with their dialects", "parents were n ' t taught in school", "parents were n ' t allowed to teach their kids to speak in the same way", "it was easy to pick up a effect in their own speech"], "human": ["parents were worried that their relatives might affect their kids ' language", "parents did n ' t allow their children to speak dialects", "parents thought the language taught in school was the best", "parents tried to avoid affecting their kids with their dialects"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
