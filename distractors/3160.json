{"id": "3160", "article": "Sports shoes that work out whether their owner has done enough exercise to promise time in front of the television have been devised in the UK . The shoes - named Square Eyes - contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day . A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television , and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day ' s efforts . The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers , says Gillian Swan , who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London , UK . \" We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out , \" she says . \" And I wanted to tackle that with my design . \" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise , the television automatically switches off . And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps . Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both . Health experts suggest that a child take 12 , 000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television . So , every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time . Existing pedometers normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement . Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking . But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to cheat . \" It is possible , but it would be a lot of effort , \" she says . \" That was one of my main design considerations . \"", "questions": "Which of the following would be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["a new way to play tv time", "smart shoes decide on television time"], "human": ["Smart Shoes Measure Time of Exercise", "Smart Shoes Decide on Television Time"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
