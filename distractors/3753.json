Children who are not taught these lessons pay the consequences for a life time . Some parents do n ' t teach children about money because they think they should n ' t talk about money with children , do n ' t have the time , or think they do n ' t have enough money . Parents should take the time to teach children about money regardless of their income and should start when children are young . Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money , based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families . Most often , these experiences , values , and beliefs are different for each parent . It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money . Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children : Advise rather than order how the child ' s money should be used . Allow children to learn by mistakes and by successes . Be consistent while taking children ' s differences into account . Include all family members in money management discussions , decision making , and activities suitable for their age . Explan to children what they can and can not do and the consequences of going above the limits . As children get older increasingly include them in discussions of limits and consequences . Expect all family members to perform unpaid , routine household work based on their abilities . Express your desire to have things you ca n ' t afford . Children need to know that parents say \" no \" to themselves , too .", "questions": "The writer believes that if children do n ' t learn good money habits , they", "options": {"model": ["wo n ' t learn from money", "wo n ' t learn much from their parents", "will suffer the bad results all their life"], "human": ["wo n ' t be able to earn enough", "wo n ' t be involved in housework", "will suffer the bad results all their life"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
