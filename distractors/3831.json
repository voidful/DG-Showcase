{"id": "3831", "article": "Monty Roberts was the son of a poor family . He liked horses . He had a dream to own a horse ranch ever since he was a little child . One day when he was at high school , he was asked to write a paper . It was about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up . He worked hard on it , and wrote a seven - page paper . In the paper he described his dream of owning a big horse ranch someday . The next day he handed it in to his teacher . Two days later he received his paper back . On the front page was a large red F ( fail ) with a note that read , \" See me after class . \" He went to see the teacher after class and asked , \" Why did I receive an F ? \" The teacher answered , \" This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you . You come from a poor family . You have no money . Owning a horse ranch needs a lot of money . You have to buy the land . _ \" Then he added , \" Write this paper again . If you write it with a realistic plan , you may receive a better grade . \" After sitting with it for a week , he turned in the same paper , making no changes at all . He said to the teacher , \" You can keep the F and I ' ll keep my dream . \" Monty kept his dream and worked very hard . Today he owns a large horse ranch with a big house on it , and he keeps that school paper he wrote on the wall of his sitting room . Last summer the same school teacher came to visit him . When the teacher was leaving , he said , \" Look , Monty , when I was your teacher , I was something of a dream stealer . During those years I stole a lot of children ' s dreams . It was lucky that you had n ' t given up yours . \" Do n ' t let anyone steal your dream . Follow your dream , no matter what .", "questions": "After Monty heard his teacher ' s advice , he", "options": {"model": ["wrote a poem on a paper", "decided to buy a big horse", "wrote a poem", "turned in the same paper"], "human": ["changed his dream", "received a better grade", "turned in a different paper", "turned in the same paper"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
