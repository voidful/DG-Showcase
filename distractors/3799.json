{"id": "3799", "article": "A few years ago I was on a bicycle trip when I got off my bike for a rest . I sat down on the grass . A few seconds later , I was covered in ants . They were swarming all over me so I got up and brushed them off . It was a strange experience but I soon forgot about it . A couple of years later , I was living in Jordan . I had just moved into a modern flat and was unpacking plates when I saw something move out of the corner of my eye . I looked over at the kitchen drawer and there was a cockroach crawling out of it . I screamed . Then I grabbed a can of _ and sprayed it on the cockroach . He ran under the nearby bathroom door . It took me three days before I found the courage to open the bathroom door to see if he was still alive . He was n ' t . Why did I react so violently to one lone insect when a closer encounter with hundreds of ants hardly affected me ? The answer is easy : because cockroaches are creepy crawlies and ants are n ' t . Creepy crawlies are those little bugs which cause feelings such as anxiety - they make your skin crawl . Did you know that some people feel such a fear of bugs that it becomes a phobia ? Psychologists have offered many explanations . Some say we associate them with dirt and disease . Or that these are life forms that are so alien to us , that we find them disgusting for their dissimilarity . Insects , however , do n ' t follow our rules - they just do what they want and invade our space . Unfortunately , although insects and bugs have been a successful animal species up to now , many of them , like many other species nowadays , are under threat of dying out . Entomologistswarn that this could upset entire ecosystems and lead to all kinds of disastrous consequences . So my advice to you is : the next time you feel the urge to stamp on , splatter or spray a creepy crawly , give a thought to the planet and stop .", "questions": ".
