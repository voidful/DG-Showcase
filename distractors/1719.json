{"id": "1719", "article": "Sir John a British scientist who won last year ' s Nobel prize for medicine , said he had predicted at the time of his frog experiments that the successful cloning of a mammal would happen within 50 years . and that \" maybe the same answer is appropriate \" far the step to human cloning . Parents who lose children in accidents may be able to clone \" copies \" to replace them then . Although any attempt to clone an entire human would raise complex moral issues , the biologist claimed people would soon overcome their concerns if the technique became medically useful . Cloning was regarded with extreme doubts when it was first developed but became widely accepted after the birth of Louise Brown , the first \" test tube baby \" He said , \" When my first frog experiment . s were done , an American reporter asked how long it will be before these things can he done in mammals or humans I said , ' Well , it could be anywhere between 10 years and 100 years - how about 50 year ? ' It turned out that it was n ' t far off the mark as far as Dolly was concerned . Maybe the same answer is appropriate . \" Sir John added that cloning a human being effectively means making an identical twin , and doctors would therefore simply be \" copying what nature has already produced \" The average vote on allowing parents of deceased children , who are no longer fertile , to create another using the mother ' s eggs and skin cells from the first child , thinking the technique was safe and effective , is 60 per cent in favor . The reasons for \" no \" are usually that the new child would feel they were some sort of a replacement for something . .", "questions": "According to the text , which statement is NOT true ?", "options": {"model": ["a cloning is a good way to clone a human .", "the cloned cloning will be done in human beings .", "human cloning is creating something that did n ' t exist before .", "cloning is a way to make a human be properly understood by parents of human beings ."], "human": ["Louise Brown is the first \" test tube baby \" .", "Human cloning is still a controversial topic .", "Sir John is positive about the future of human cloning .", "Human cloning is creating something that did n ' t exist before ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
