{"id": "906", "article": "When I was a child , our dining room had two kinds of chairs - - two large ones with arm rests and four small ones without . The larger ones stood at the ends of the table , the smaller ones on the sides . Mom and Dad sat in the big chairs , except when one of us was away ; then Mom would sit in one of the smaller chairs . Dad always sat at the end , at the \" head \" of the table . Sitting where he did , Dad was framed by the window through which the yard could be seen with its trees and grass . His chair was not just a place for him at the table ; it was a place in which he was situated against the yard and trees . It was the holy and protected place that was his , and ours through him . After Dad retired , he and Mom moved out into a small flat . When they came to visit me at their old house . Dad still sat at the end of the table though the table was no longer his but mine . Only with my marriage to Barbara , did I hear a voice questioning the arrangement . She requested , gently but firmly , that I sit at the head of the table in our home . I realized then that I was head of the family , but I also felt unwilling to introduce such a change . How would I feel sitting in that \" head \" place in my Dad ' s presence ? And how would he handle it ? I was to find out on the occasion of our youngest child ' s first birthday . Mom and Dad arrived for lunch , and went into the dining room . Dad moved toward his usual seat in front of the window . Before he could get around the side of the table , I took a deep breath and said , \" Dad , this is going to be your place , next to Mom , on the side . \" He stopped , looked at me and then sat down . I felt sad , and angry at Barbara for pushing me to do this . It would have been easy to say , \" My mistake , Dad . Sit where you always sit . \" But I did n ' t . When he and Mom were seated , Barbara and I took our places . I do n ' t know how Dad felt . I do know that , though removed from his usual place", "questions": "Where did the writer ' s mother sit when one of the children was away ?", "options": {"model": ["she went into the dining room with her father .", "she went into the dining room to sit .", "she went into the dining room to sit in the small flat .", "she moved to an empty chair on the side ."], "human": ["She did n ' t change her chair .", "She moved her own chair next Dad ' s .", "She sat opposite to Dad .", "She moved to an empty chair on the side ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
