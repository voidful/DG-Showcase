In June 1977 , a baby girl became seriously ill in Deleville . Doctors there were unable to find out the cause of her illness , so she was sent to a famous hospital in London , where there were many excellent doctors . The baby was so seriously ill that a team of doctors hurried to examine the baby without delay . The doctors , too , were puzzled by the baby ' s illness and they also became discouraged . Just then a nurse asked to speak to them . \" I think the baby is suffering from thallium ( n . ) poisoning . \" said the nurse . \" A few days ago , I read a story ' A Pale Horse ' written by Agatha Christie . Someone uses thallium poison , and all the symptoms are written in the book . They are exactly the same as the baby ' s . \" \" You ' re very good at observing things , \" said a doctor , \" and you may be right . We ' ll carry out some tests and find out whether the cause is thallium poisoning or not . \" The tests proved that the baby had indeed been poisoned by thallium . Once they knew the cause , the doctors were able to give her correct treatment . The baby soon got well and was sent back to Deleville A week later , it was reported that the poison might have come from an insecticide ( n . ) used in Deleville .", "questions": "As far as we can tell from the story , Agatha Christie", "options": {"model": ["found out the cause of the baby ' s disease", "had never met this baby", "could n ' t find the cause"], "human": ["had spent a long time studying the baby ' s illness", "visited the baby both in Deleville and London", "had never met this baby"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
