{"id": "3726", "article": "We like people who look like us , because they tend to have personalities similar to our own . And , a new study suggests , the longer we are with someone , the more similarities in appearance grow . Researchers set out to study why couples often tend to look like one another . They asked 11 male and 11 female participants to judge the age , attractiveness and personality of 160 real - life married couples . Photographs of husbands and wives were viewed separately , so the participants did n ' t know who was married to whom . The test participants rated men and women who were actual couples as looking alike and having similar personalities . Also , the longer the couples had been together , the greater the similarities . The researchers guess that the sharing of experiences might affect how couples look . The idea that there is a connection between appearance and personality might seem strange at first , but there could be biological reasons for a link , said study member Tony Little from the University of Liverpool in England . \" The face displays our emotions and over time , emotional expressions may become written in the face , \" Little told Live Science . For example , someone who smiles a lot may develop lines and muscles that are suggestive of someone who is happy . Other studies have shown that partners who are genetically similar to each other tend to have happier marriages . The new study indicates that people have different features when using facial appearance to make decisions about someone ' s personality , and that the particular cues focused on change from face to face . Vital to the decision , however , are eyes and smiles . \" Smiles are important social cues that may tell us whether or not someone is friendly , and eyes are also a traditional focus of attention , \" Little said . Overall face shape can be important too . For example , the combination of large chins and strong brow ridges can create an impression of disagreeableness and being unwilling to cooperate , Little said .", "questions": "The passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["why people who look like us", "why some old lovers look like each other", "how to judge people ' s personality by their looks"], "human": ["how to tell who have similar personalities", "why lovers who look alike have happier marriages", "why some old lovers look like each other"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
