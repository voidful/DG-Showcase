{"id": "1794", "article": "As the saying goes , man struggles upwards ; water flows downwards . Water runs downhill from mountaintops to streams to rivers to oceans . But downhill is n ' t the only way that water moves . A new study measures how water travels from country to country for human consumption . This flow is n ' t the type we usually think about . These scientists looked at the water used to grow and make the products which get shipped from nation to nation as imports or exports . They call this a flow of \" virtual water \" . We typically think about water as the liquid that flows from a tap . However , 92 % of the water used by people goes into growing crops , according to water researcher Arjen Hoekstra . He recently studied the hidden travels of virtual water used in products made from things like crops and meats . These products are shipped around the world . For example , consider a sugary soft drink . Hoekstra estimated that to produce one half - liter of the drink requires between 170 and 310liters of the water - - about 95 % - - is used to grow and process the ingredients . Another 4 % goes into the packaging and labeling . In Hoekstra ' s calculation , when one country produces a half - liter of soda and sells it abroad , it exports as much virtual water as would fill a large refrigerator . According to Hoekstra ' s new report , dry countries like Israel and Kuwait , both in the Middle East , get the majority of their virtual water from other countries , through imported products . More surprisingly , some wetter countries , like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , also get the majority of their virtual water from other places . That means that most of the water used to grow or produce the products and food consumed in those countries came from other countries . In the United States most of the virtual water used comes from American sources . In China even less of the water associated with its products .", "questions": "What is the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["importance of water", "water ' s worldwide travels", "benefits of water", "benefit of water travel"], "human": ["Crops and Virtual Water", "Benefits of Virtual Water", "Import and Export of Water", "Water ' s worldwide travels"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
