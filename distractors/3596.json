{"id": "3596", "article": "The knowledge society will be a highly competitive one , for organizations and individuals alike . Information technology , although only one of many new features of the next society , is already having one hugely important effect : it is allowing knowledge to spread near - instantly , and making it accessible to everyone . Given the ease and speed at which information travels , every institution in the knowledge society - - not only businesses , but also schools , universities , hospitals and increasingly government agencies too - - has to be globally competitive , even though most organizations will continue to be local in their activities and in their markets . This is because the Internet will keep customers everywhere informed on what is available anywhere in the world , and at what price . This new knowledge economy will rely heavily on knowledge workers . At present , this term is widely used to describe people with considerable theoretical knowledge and learning : doctors , lawyers , teachers , accountants chemical engineers . But the most striking growth will be in \" knowledge technologists \" : computer technicians , software designers , analysts in clinical labs , manufacturing technologists , paralegals . These people are as much manual workers and they are knowledge workers ; in fact , they usually spend far more time working with their hands than with their brains , but their manual work is based on a substantial amount of theoretical knowledge which can be acquired only through formal education , not through an apprenticeship . They are not , as a rule , much better paid than traditional skilled workers , but they see themselves as \" professionals \" , just as unskilled manual workers in manufacturing were the _ social and political force in the 21thcentury , knowledge technologists are likely to become the dominant social - - and perhaps also political - - force over the next decades .", "questions": "The quick spread of knowledge in the next society", "options": {"model": ["is based on information technology", "depends on knowledge workers"], "human": ["results from a highly competitive society", "is based on information technology"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
