{"id": "2337", "article": "Imagine a stranger walking past you on a cold , rainy day . \" Lovely weather , is n ' t it ? \" the stranger says . Do you laugh , or even smile ? If not , you may not have a dry sense of humor . British people , and particularly the English , are well - known for our dry sense of humor . We often say the opposite of what we mean in order to be funny , and tell jokes in a tone of voice that makes it sound like we are being completely serious . As US writer Julian Tan put it on the HuffPost Students blog : \" It is as if it is ' Opposite Day ' every day in Britain . \" If the people of Britain are known for having a \" _ \" and not showing emotion , then our dry sense of humor shows this through jokes . Often it will take a long time or several beers , to get a British person to tell you what they actually think about something and get behind the wall of humorous sarcasm that they have in front of them . English comedian Ricky Gervais put it like this : \" We play jokes on our friends . We use sarcasm as a shield and a weapon . We avoid being serious until it ' s absolutely necessary . \" It can be annoying and confusing if you have n ' t been raised with these types of jokes : \" Why did he just say such a ridiculous thing ? Is he making fun of me ? \" But it is also true that understanding this type of humor is a good way to make friends with people in the UK , even if you do n ' t find it funny . It ' s important to remember that the person telling the joke may actually be making fun of himself or herself , not you . One of the characteristics of British humor is \" its strong theme of self - deprecation \" ( making fun of oneself ) , according to Tan . So do n ' t worry - often , English people , and British people in general , just want to make fun of themselves !", "questions": "According to the passage , we can know that someone with a dry sense of humor can", "options": {"model": ["not use sarcasm as a shield and a weapon .", "make fun of himself", "not make fun of one ' s bad at humor ."], "human": ["not make friends with people in the UK", "pretend to play jokes on their friends", "not use sarcasm as a shield and a weapon ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
