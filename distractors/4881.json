{"id": "4881", "article": "I was born in the Tronto , Canada . Life looked bright and was filled with hope for my parents and me . My father and mother were married in 1980 , and I was born next year . As I grew into a man , I often looked to my father for advice and support . There were many things about his character that I admired , but like any young boy , I often thought that my father ' s ideas were from the past and out of date . I did well as a student and was the first person in my family to graduate from university . I went on to be a university professor and writer , and most people would say that I have had a very successful life . But I know much of my success is because of the lessons that he passed onto me . On Father ' s Day , I will look in the mirror and smile . My dad gave me many gifts , including my now bald head , and the friendly smile that my friends say I have . Thank you again , dad . I miss you . Happy Father ' s Day .", "questions": "From the passage we can know", "options": {"model": ["the writer ' s father did well as a student", "the writer ' s father did well in his study", "the writer misses his father very much", "the writer ' s father is a very good student in the university"], "human": ["the writer is grateful to his father for what his father has done", "the writer ' s life is bright and full of hope", "the writer ' s father is loving", "the writer misses his father very much"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
