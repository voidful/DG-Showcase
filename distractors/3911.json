{"id": "3911", "article": "Orcas , or killer whales , are the largest of the dolphins and one of the world ' s most powerful animals feeding on meat . They feast on marine mammals such as seals , sea lions , and even whales , employing teeth that can be four inches ( ten centimeters ) long . They are known to grab seals right off the ice . They also eat fish , squid , and seabirds . Though they often frequent cold , coastal waters , orcas can be found from the polar regions to the Equator . Killer whales hunt in deadly groups , family groups of up to 40 individuals . There appear to be both permanent and temporary group populations of killer whales . These different groups may hunt different animals and use different techniques to catch them . Permanent groups tend to prefer fish , while temporary groups target marine mammals . All groups use effective , cooperative hunting techniques that some are similar to the behavior of wolf packs . Whales make a wide variety of communicative sounds , and each group has various noises that its members will recognize even at a distance . They use echolocation to communicate and hunt , making sounds that travel underwater until they meet objects , then reflect back , showing their location , size , and shape . Killer whales are protective of their young , and other adolescent females often assist the mother in caring for them . Mothers give birth every three to ten years , after a 17 - month pregnancy . Killer whales are immediately recognizable by their special black - and - white coloring and are the intelligent , trainable stars of many aquarium shows . Killer whales have never been widely hunted by humans .", "questions": "We can conclude that", "options": {"model": ["killer whales hunt and communicate with each other", "by making sounds killer whales hunt and communicate", "killer whales hunt and communicate", "killer whales hunt in large groups"], "human": ["people can find killer whales everywhere around the world", "killer whales live in different groups and never live alone", "humans ' hunt has made killer whales being endangered", "by making sounds killer whales hunt and communicate"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
