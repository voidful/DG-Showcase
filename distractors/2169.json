{"id": "2169", "article": "It was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy , aged about four , approached her two - year - old son and pushed him to the ground . \" I ' d watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he ' d pushed , \" she says . \" I went over to them , picked up my son , turned to the boy and said , firmly , ' No , we do n ' t push . ' \" What happened next was unexpected . \" The boy ' s mother ran toward me from across the park , \" Stella says , \" I thought she was coming over to apologize , but instead she started shouting at me for blaming her child . All I did was let him know his behavior was unacceptable . Was I supposed to sit back while her kid did whatever he wanted and hurt other children ? \" Getting your own children to play nice is difficult enough . Dealing with other people ' s children has become a hidden danger . In my house , jumping on the sofa is not allowed . In my sister ' s house it ' s encouraged . I find myself saying \" no \" a lot when her kids are over at mine . That ' s OK between sisters but becomes dangerous when you ' re talking to the children of friends or acquaintances . \" Kids are n ' t all raised the same , \" agrees Professor Naomi White of Monash University . \" But there is still an idea that they ' re the property of the parent . We see our children as a mirror of ourselves , so if you ' re saying that my child is behaving improperly , then that ' s somehow a criticism of me . \" In those situations , it ' s difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first . There are two opinions . \" I ' d go to the child first , \" says Andrew Fuller , author of Tricky Kids . \" Usually a quiet reminder that ' we do n ' t do that here ' is enough . Kids have antennae for how to behave in different settings . \" He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel careless ,", "questions": "What does the author say about dealing with other people ' s children ?", "options": {"model": ["parents should treat their children in different ways", "it ' s possible for one to get into lots of trouble", "there is nothing wrong with the children ' s behavior", "it ' s necessary to deal with other people ' s children"], "human": ["It ' s important not to hurt them in any way", "It ' s no use trying to stop their wrongdoing", "It ' s advisable to treat them as one ' s own kids", "It ' s possible for one to get into lots of trouble"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
