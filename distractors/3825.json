{"id": "3825", "article": "When I wake up on summer mornings , I know I am going to my favorite place to volunteer and make a difference in someone ' s life just by being with him or her - - a summer school for autistic children . By helping the kids read or do math , I am not only teaching important skills but also helping them feel like any other kid . There are many wrong ideas about autism . The kids I work with can think and feel . They need help only in certain areas . Of course , each kid is special . For example , some kids like to draw , and others like to sing . At the school , the kids learn through about 20 activities . These activities can help them learn skills they will need later in life . The very first day I volunteered , a boy came up to me , put his hand on my shoulder , and said \" Hello \" . From then on , I knew I could make a difference . Another boy loved to have me read books that can help him learn to read . Sometimes he could be encouraged to read a few words or sentences . Finally , one day during reading practice , he read nearly 220 words himself ! Summer school is also a time for fun , Last summer , bagpipe players came to perform . Most of us had our hands over our ears because they were so loud . When they asked for a volunteer from the audience , one girl raised her hand as high as she could , got up on stage , and even tried the bagpipes in front of everyone . Through these experiences , I realize that the challenges these kids face do not stop them from doing many amazing things . I ' m teaching them , but they are teaching me more .", "questions": "What does the author mainly talk about in the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["his experience as a volunteer in a special summer school .", "his experience in a summer school ."], "human": ["His teaching experience in a summer holiday .", "His experience as a volunteer in a special summer school ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
