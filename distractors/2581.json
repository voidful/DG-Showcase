Volunteers who were asked to remember a pleasant event from past 24 hours began to feel happier right away . Other activities such as saying \" Thank you \" and smiling also made volunteers feel happier , but not as much . Professor Richard Wiseman of Hertfordshire University planned the study . He got 26 , 000 people to go online to try out a few different activities to make them feel happier . They were told to be nice , remember a pleasant event from the day before , give thanks or smile for 15 seconds twice a day . The volunteers did these activities for one week . The result showed that thinking about one good thing that had happened the day before worked the best for making people happier .
