{"id": "1507", "article": "As an effect of the high fuel prices spent on bus transportation , some American schools are changing to a four - day week . That means longer days instead of the traditional Monday through Friday schedule . Having been approved for three years and beginning in the fall , students in the Maccray school district in Minnesota will be in school from Tuesday to Friday . Each school day will be 65 minutes longer . Officials say the district expects to save about sixty - five thousand dollars a year in transportation costs . In new Mexico , the first school district changed to a four - day week in 1974 because of the Arab oil boycott . Now , 17 out of 89 districts use it . In Custer , South Dakota , students have been going to school four days a week since 1995 . Superintendent Tim Creal says the change has saved about one million dollars over just the past eight years . He sees other benefits , too . Students get more instructional time , and activities that used to take up class time are now held on non - school days . He says that in the future , the growth of online classes could make it possible to require even fewer days in school . High fuel prices are driving college students to take more online classes . A four - day school week sounds like a great idea for students and teachers , but working parents may have to pay for child care for that fifth day .", "questions": "The passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["some new school days", "some school ' s four - day week plan", "a four - day week"], "human": ["districts using a four - day week .", "expense of school transportation .", "some school ' s four - day week plan"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
