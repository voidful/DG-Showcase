{"id": "770", "article": "How could I turn down an opportunity for a weeklong cruise on a luxury motorsailer in the Andaman Sea ? Without a second thought , I packed my bags and jumped on a plane to Singapore , and the following day I found myself looking out the airplane window at the beautiful waters surrounding the island of Langkawi off the coast of Malaysia . The last time I was in Langkawi was in 2001 , when it was relatively quiet . Langkawi has come a long way since then ; there are 4 , 5 , and even 6 - star hotels , as well as spas , golfing , horseback riding and even a cable car taking visitors to the highest point on the island . At the Langkawi International Airport I met my shipmates and we were driven to Pantai Tengah with a quick pit stop for sunblock and duty - free goodies . Many other shopping opportunities abound since Langkawi was designated as a duty - free zone in 1987 to entice tourists to the island . A luxurious yacht tender picked us up . Phillipe , the first mate , maneuvered the tender between sailboats and as we went around a small island there she was , S / V Blue Gold . This majestic 10 - passenger sailboat - - all 165 feet of her - - had been built in Italy and recently underwent a full retrofit . Once aboard , the crew welcomed us with refreshments and big smiles . Before we got too comfortable and settled into the plush comforts of the boat , Alain , the captain , took us on a tour of Blue Gold ' s impressive accommodations . The master suite had a king - size bed , with a lounge area and \" his & hers \" wardrobes . The VIP cabin had a queen - size bed , also with a lounge area . Both had ensuite bathrooms . The first evening aboard was the perfect start to our voyage - - a small cocktail party followed by a light meal of seared tuna salad . It was exactly what our jet - lagged bodies craved , and we all slept very well aboard what would become our new home for the next 7 days . In the morning after breakfast , we sailed to Pulau Ta Ngah ( also spelled \" Pulau Tengah \" ; pulau means island in Malay ) . In the 1970s the site had been a Vietnamese refugee transit camp . Not long after the end of the war", "questions": "Where is Langkawi ?", "options": {"model": ["in malaysia", "in the island"], "human": ["In Pulau Ta Ngah", "In Malaysia"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
