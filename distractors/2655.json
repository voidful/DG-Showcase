{"id": "2655", "article": "A relationship is defined as a state of connectedness between people . Although in today ' s society with its crazy rhythm of everyday life , when people tend to live in thickly populated cities , spending most of their time in the office and hardly knowing their neighbor ' s name , we still find ourselves in some kinds of relationships - with friends , family , or colleagues . Family relationships are the first relationships people enter . Parents and relatives influence our emotional development by creating a model that we are sometimes bound to follow all our lives , often subconsciously . In day - care , at school , then in the office we spend a lot of time among fellow students and co - workers . We learn to keep business relationships , to work in a team environment , then form smaller groups of like - minded people and finally select some of them as our friends . What is a true friendship ? How does it start ? Are we destined to become friends with certain people or can we actually plan whom to be friends with ? \" Everybody ' s friend is nobody ' s . \" said Arthur Schopenhauer . Unlike a companionship based on belonging to the same team or group , friendship is a very personal and selective type of relationship . It calls for trust , sincerity , and emotional bonds . Sociologists believe that most people are looking for similarities in views , social status , and interests when choosing friends . No wonder that our friends are often people of the same age , sex , and education . Another important factor is joint activity and solidarity . This is the reason why many of us befriend our colleagues and other people who work in the same field . Most people would agree that a friend is someone who always listens and understands . Understanding in this context implies a lot of meanings - compassion , sympathy , and emotional closeness . It ' s a process in which your friend reads your emotional state , shares your feelings , identifies himself or herself with you .", "questions": "Which of the following statements is NOT true ?", "options": {"model": ["friendships between people are not friends .", "relationships are friendships between people .", "friends are always people of the same age .", "friends are always people of the same age , sex and education ."], "human": ["A companionship is based on belonging to the same team or group .", "Friendship needs trust , sincerity , and emotional bonds .", "Understanding is a process in which the friend reads our emotional state , shares our feelings , identifies himself / herself with us .", "Relationships are friendships between people ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
