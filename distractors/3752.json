{"id": "3752", "article": "My 16 - year - old son , Anton , had gone to the local swimming hole . Most of the kids who swim there are fit and strong teens , and there are plenty of rocks for them to use as safe harbors , so I had no fears for his well - being . Still , the firefighter ' s first words , \" You need to come up here to the Stillwater River , \" made me catch my breath . When I got to the river , I saw Anton sitting quietly on a low platform of the fire engine , with a towel wrapped about his shoulders . I hurried over to him . \" You OK ? \" I asked . \" Yeah , \" was all he said . But my eyes begged for an explanation . I did n ' t get it from my son . The story was this : A couple in their 20s , unfamiliar with the Stillwater , had gotten caught in the current and began screaming for help . Without hesitation Anton and his friend dived into the water , swam out to the drowning woman , and brought her safely to shore . In an age in which the world \" hero \" is broadcast with abandon and seemingly applied to anyone , I realized the real thing in my son and his friend - - the disregarding of personal safety for the sake of another human being . I know that teens are headstrong and self - centered , but this did n ' t lower the gravity of the event and the desire to do good . Along the way home I tried to get some more information from him , but the only words were , \" What ' s for supper ? \" I thought twice about the tragedy that might have been . Questions flew across my mind like a flight of swallows : Would I have risked my life to save a drowning person ? Or would I have chosen to dial 911 ? Would I have told the story over and over to anyone who ' d listen ? The next morning , when Anton got up , I half expected him to tell me the story from his point of view , now that he had some distance from the event . But all he did was to toast a pie , pull himself together , and head for the door to begin the new day .", "questions": "We can infer from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["teens are more likely to be brave in life", "teens are more responsible than expected"], "human": ["it ' s dangerous to swim in an unfamiliar river", "teens are more responsible than expected"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
