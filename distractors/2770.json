{"id": "2770", "article": "Do you have any skiing equipment you no longer need ? A ski school in the far north of India could put it to good use . In March we published a photo story about the extraordinary Zsnskar region in northern India , which is cut off from the outside world for more than seven months of the year , and only accessible via a frozen river . We also included information about the limited use of skiing in the region and the recent creation of the Zanskar Ski School : \" Despite the difficulties of travelling through the region when the snow comes , skiing has n ' t traditionally been used as a means of transport by the locals , largely because trees do n ' t grow here , so there is little in the way of raw materials from which to make skis . In 1995 , a group of British scientists in the region noticed the lack of skis and one of them returned to set up the Zanskar Ski School in Padam . The school provides lessons for a small fee and rents skis to the local people . Among the benefits that the school hopes to bring are improved education - - children often find it difficult to get to school through the deep snow - - and the possibility of offering ski tours to tourists in the future . So far , more than 300 local people have received training , and local doctors and policemen regularly borrow skis . \" But what we were n ' t able to include in the article is that the ski school is always on the look out for old skiing equipment - - particularly of a size suitable for children - - and , I thought . Now the European ski season is drawing to a close , there might be a few of you out there who have some old equipment you ' d like to see go to a good home . If that ' s the ease you can get in touch with the school via their website www . zanskarski school . org .", "questions": "Who would be the most helpful to the school now ?", "options": {"model": ["students without skiing equipment .", "the local people .", "people having old skiing equipment ."], "human": ["Students in the Zanskar Ski School", "Locals in Zanskar region", "People having old skiing equipment ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
