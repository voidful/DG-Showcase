The cool colors are green , blue and violet . These colors , unlike warm colors , are relaxing . Where there are cool colors , people are usually quiet . People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue . Red may be exciting , but one scientist says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colors than in a room with cool colors . He says that a warm color , such as red or orange , is good color for a living room or restaurant . People who are resting or eating do not want time to pass quickly . Cool colors are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly .", "questions": "According to this passage , people who do n ' t like to be with others", "options": {"model": ["like blue color", "are not active", "do n ' t like warm colors"], "human": ["like orange color", "prefer warm color", "like blue color"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
