{"id": "5376", "article": "How quickly can you count from one to ten ? Do you use ten different words to do it ? Can you do it in English , or do you have to use your first language ? Do you count on your fingers ? Many people think that numbers and math are the same all over the world . But scientists have discovered that it is not true . People in different parts of the world use different ways to count on their fingers . In the United States , people begin counting with their first finger , which they extend or stick out . They then extend the rest of their fingers and finally the thumb to count to five . Then they repeat this with the other hand to get to ten . In China , people count by using different finger positions . In this way , a Chinese person can easily count to ten on only one hand . Besides ways of finger counting , scientists have found that cultures and languages are also different when it comes to numbers . Some languages have only a few words for numbers , and others have no words for numbers . A group of scientists studied aboriginal people in Australia . There people do n ' t have hand movements to stand for numbers . They do n ' t even have words for numbers . However , they are still able to understand different ideas about numbers . In a similar study , researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered that people of the Piraha tribe in northwestern Brazil do n ' t have words for numbers such as \" one \" or \" three \" . They are not able to say \" five trees \" or \" ten trees \" but can say \" some trees \" . \" more trees \" . or \" many trees \" . Professor Edward Gibson said that most people believe that everyone knows how to count , \" but here is a group that does not count . They could learn , but it ' s not useful in their culture , so they ' ve never picked it up . \" Although all humans are able to understand quantities , not all languages have numbers and not all people use counting . Number words in a certain language are a result of people needing numbers in their daily lives . Now we know that people have different ideas about numbers and math , too .", "questions": "What is the main idea of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["some people have different ideas about number and math .", "people from different cultures have different ideas about numbers and math .", "some people have no words for numbers .", "different ways to count and learn how to count ."], "human": ["Chinese people can count more easily on their fingers than Americans .", "In some aboriginal cultures , people do n ' t even know how to count .", "Some languages do n ' t have number words because people do n ' t need numbers .", "People from different cultures have different ideas about numbers and math ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
