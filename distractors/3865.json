{"id": "3865", "article": "In an ideal world , people would not test medicines on animals . Such experiments are stressful and sometimes painful for animals , and expensive and timeconsuming for people . Yet animal experimentation is still needed to help bridge vast gaps in medical knowledge . That is why there are some 50 to 100 million animals used in research around the world each year . Europe , on the whole , has the world ' s most restrictive laws on animal experiments . Even so , its scientists use some 12 million animals a year , most of them mice and rats , for medical research . Official statistics show that just 1 . 1 million animals are used in research in America each year . But that is misleading . The American authorities do not think mice and rats are worth counting and , as these are the most common laboratory animals , the true figure is much higher . Japan and China have even less comprehensive data than America . Now Europe is reforming the rules governing animal experiments by restricting the number of animals used in labs . Alternatives to animal testing , such as using human tissue or computer models , are now strongly recommended . In addition , sharing all research results freely should help to reduce the number of animals for scientific use . At present , scientists often share only the results of successful experiments . If their findings do not fit the hypothesis being tested , the work never sees the light of day . This practice means wasting time , money , and animals ' lives in endlessly repeating the failed experiments . Animal experimentation has taught humanity a great deal and saved countless lives . It needs to continue , even if that means animals sometimes suffer . Europe ' s new measures should eventually both reduce the number of animals used in experiments and improve the way in which scientific research is conducted .", "questions": "What usually happens to unsuccessful animal experiments ?", "options": {"model": ["they have been carried out by scientists only .", "they are not made known to the public ."], "human": ["They are not removed from the research topic list .", "They are not made known to the public ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
