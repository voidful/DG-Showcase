I heard it many times as a child , whenever my family visited Aunt Bettie in the old house in Berryville , Virginia . Bettie Van Metre had good reason to hate the Civil War . Her brother was killed at Gettysburg , and her husband , James , a Confederate officer , was taken prisoner and sent to an unknown prison camp somewhere . One day in late September , Dick came to Bettie reporting that he had found a wounded Union soldier in a farmhouse half a mile away from the Van Metre home . When talking about her first sight of the man in the blood - spotted blue uniform , she always used the same words . _ She went out into the cool air , trying not to be sick at the thought of that smashed right hand , that missing left leg . The man ' s papers Bettie found in the farmhouse showed his identity : Henry Bedell , 30 years old .

This is how she explained it : \" I kept wondering if he had a wife somewhere , hoping , and not knowing - - just as I was . It seemed to me that the only thing that mattered was to get her husband back to her . \" Slowly , patiently , skillfully , Aunt Bettie fanned the spark of life in Henry Bedell . Of drugs or medicines she had almost none . And she was not willing to take any from the few supplies at the Confederate hospital . But she did the best she could with what she had .

But the next day , Bedell had a high fever . Knowing that she must get help , she went to her family doctor , Graham Osborne . Dr . Osborne examined Bedell and said , \" there was little hope unless proper medicines could be found . \" \" I ' ll get them from the Yankees at Harpers Ferry . \" Bettie said . The doctor told her that Harpers Ferry was almost 20 miles away . Even if she reached them , the Yankees would never believe her . \" I ' ll take proof", "questions": "What message is conveyed through the end of the story .", "options": {"model": ["it is a good way of", "help yourself by helping others"], "human": ["God helps those who help themselves .", "Help yourself by helping others"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
