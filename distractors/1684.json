{"id": "1684", "article": "A man enters a store to buy milk . He walks out of the store with milk . That is all - - milk . At the same time , a woman enters the same grocery store also to buy milk . She buys it . But , she also buys chicken and lemons to make dinner that night . She also gets a bottle of wine for drinks with friends and a birthday card for her husband ' s niece . And that is the difference between the female and male brains simply explained in a grocery store . Generally speaking , men do one thing at a time . Women do many . Doing many things at one time is often called \" multi - tasking , \" a very popular word these days . Now scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains . A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along - - men and women think differently . Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from 8 to 22 years old . They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain , or hemisphere . In the female brain , they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain . The left side of the brain is known as the side of \" reason \" . The right hemisphere is known as the \" creative \" side . Regina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania . She co - wrote the report . She says when women are asked to do something complicated they might use different parts of the brain . But men generally use just one . As a result , men generally deal directly with a problem . There is a strong connection between the \" understanding \" and the \" action \" parts of their brains . Women , however , might include other parts of the brain , like the part connected with \" reason \" and the part connected with sensitivity when solving a problem . Women take a less direct path to find a solution . Thanks for your listening .
