Here ' s advice from a new study : - - Make sure kids eat healthfully , starting with a good breakfast every day . - - Limit kids ' sedentary free time . - - Promote positive self - esteem in children . - - Be a good role model for a healthy life . Those tips come from Ashley Crossman , a graduate student at Arizona State University ' s sociology department . She looked at data from national surveys of about 6 , 400 teens and young adults . Crossman presented her findings in Philadelphia at the American Sociological Association ' s annual meeting . What is Obesity ? Healthy Habits Participants who grew up to have a healthy weight had some common traits . As teens , they ate breakfast , had good self - esteem , and were too busy to spend tons of time watching TV or playing computer games . Their parents also had some things in common : healthy weight , more education , and control over their kids ' diets . Parents ' income and kids ' race did n ' t make a difference , notes Crossman . Food for Thought Many factors affect weight , but \" our research suggests that prevention must begin at home , \" writes Crossman . Healthy eating and active lifestyles are part of the solution she recommends . Physical activity is promoted as part of a healthy life ( get a doctor ' s OK first ) . In this study , \" active \" did n ' t always mean tons of exercise . Teen ' s part - time jobs , volunteer activities , and hobbies also helped by reducing time with TV or computer games , notes Crossman . The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children at risk should be identified by virtue of family history of obesity , and other factors such as environment . Parents and caregivers should be encouraged to promote healthy eating patterns by offering nutritious snack such as fruit and vegetables , low - fat diary products , and whole grains ; setting appropriate limits and modeling healthy food choices . They also recommend limiting television and viewing time to a maximum of two hours a day .", "questions": "The passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["how to reduce obesity", "best prevention for obesity", "the effects of obesity on children"], "human": ["children ' s self - esteem", "healthy food for children", "best prevention for obesity"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
