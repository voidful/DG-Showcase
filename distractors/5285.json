Spending time with grandma and grandpa especially appears to help children from single - parent , divorced / separated or stepfamily households , according to the report , published in the February Journal of Family Psychology . \" Grandparents are a positive force for all families but play a significant role in families undergoing difficulties , \" the study ' s lead author , Shalhevet Attar - Schwartz , of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem , said in an American Psychological Association news release . \" They can reduce the negative influence of parents separating and be a resource for children who are going through these family changes . \" In interviewing 11 - to 16 - year olds from England and Wales , Attar - Schwartz and her team found that the more conversations the youths had with a grandparent , including asking for advice or even money , the better they got along with their peers and the fewer problems they had , such as hyperactivity and disruptive behavior . \" This was found across all three family structures , \" she said . \" But adolescents in single - parent households and stepfamilies benefited the most . The effect of their grandparents ' involvement was stronger compared to children from two biological parent families . \" The study did not look at children who lived solely with their grandparents , though . The findings have great implications for people in the United States , the authors said , because American grandparents are increasingly sharing living space with their grandchildren . A 2004 U . S . Census Bureau survey found that more than 5 million households include a grandparent and a grandchild under 18 , up 30 percent since 1990 , according to background information in the news release .", "questions": "According to the passage , grandparents will be of least benefit to a child", "options": {"model": ["from a single - parent family", "from two biological parent families"], "human": ["from a single - - parent household", "from two biological parent families"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
