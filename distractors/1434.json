{"id": "1434", "article": "Our education system was invented . There were no public systems of education before the 19th century . They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism . So the most useful subjects for work are at the top and you were probably driven away from what you did as a kid at school - - things you liked - - because you would never get a job doing that . Is that right ? Do n ' t do music . You ' re not going to be a musician . Do n ' t do art . You ' re not going to be an artist . In addition , the whole system of public education around the world is a process of university entrance . And the consequence is that many highly talented , brilliant , creative people think they ' re not because the thing they were good at was n ' t valued at school . I think we ca n ' t afford to go on that way . In the next 30 years , more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of the history . Suddenly , degrees are n ' t worth anything . When I was a student , if you had a degree , you had a job . But now you need a Master ' s degree where the previous job required a Bachelor , and now you need a Ph . D . for the other . It ' s a process of academic inflation , and it indicates the whole structure of education needs changing . All the great teachers I ' ve ever met and worked with are people who can inspire interest and curiosity and light up people ' s imaginations with the interests they themselves have for a particular field of work . I mean , teaching is not only a process of giving people direct instructions and information they have to memorize , it is much more than that . I believe our only hope for the future is to rethink the fundamental principles on which we are educating our children . And our task is to educate their whole being so they can face the future . By the way , we may not see this future , but they will . And our job is to help them make something of it .", "questions": "Things little kids like to do are not taught at school because they", "options": {"model": ["do n ' t think they ' re good at school", "are not useful for making a living", "are n ' t as successful as ordinary people do"], "human": ["do n ' t meet the expectation of parents", "do n ' t fit in classroom teaching", "are not useful for making a living"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
