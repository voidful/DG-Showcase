{"id": "3041", "article": "The water level of oceans rises and falls alternately twice a day . This movement of water is called the tide . Tides are causer by the pull of the sun and the moon on the earth ' s surface ; since the moon is closer , it affects the tides more than the sun . When the moon is directly overhead , it actually pulls on the water that is below it . This causes the water level to rise because the water is pulled away from the earth . As the moon disappears over the horizon , the pull lessens and the water level settles back towards the ocean bottom . When the water reaches its highest level , we have high tide . And when the water comes to its lowest level , we have low tide from its lowest point , the water rises gradually for about six hours until it reaches high tide . Then it begins to fall continuously for about six hours until it reaches low tide . Then the cycle begins again .", "questions": "Which of the following may be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the moon and the tide", "the water of the sea", "gravity of the moon", "the danger of the moon"], "human": ["The Moon and Ocean", "Water Levels", "The Pull of the Moon and the Sun", "The Moon and the Tide"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
