{"id": "1839", "article": "More and more Americans are showing an interest in healthy and locally - produced food . As the interest increases , raising chickens has been gaining popularity in some American cities . \" Look , we get three eggs this time . \" Collecting eggs is a daily pleasure for the Hurst family . Naomi Hurst says her family started to raise chickens in back of their home in Maryland a month ago . \" We have wanted to try having backyard chickens for a couple years now . And really just did n ' t have the time to build my own coop ( ; ) and look out where to buy chickens . And then we met Rent a Coop , \" said Naomi Hurst . Rent a Coop is a chicken rental business . Tyler Phillips launched the company with a partner 18 months ago . It comes with a mobile coop on wheels , two egg - laying hens , feed , bedding , water bowl , feed bowl , and our 24 - hour chicken hotline . You can call with any questions . The price is 185 dollars for four weeks . After the four weeks passed , individuals can extend the rental agreement , return everything or purchase the animals and supplies . Tyler Phillips designs and makes the coops . He says he wants to do as little damage as possible to the environment . \" We always try to have as many recycled materials as possible . And I want the coops to be safe for kids . I want the chickens to be comfortable and they have access to the grass while being inside the coop . I want it to be easily movable , light weight , \" he said . Some cities require people have large pieces of land , if they want to raise farm animals . Others require an agreement with neighbors , limit the number of chickens , or , even ban the birds . Tyler Phillips expects that would change as interest in small poultry coops grows . \" I see cities around the D . C . area changing laws almost monthly and different cities will change the law to being prochicken . That is happening all around the United States , \" he said , He believes that there will be chicken rental businesses in most American cities within five years .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["the price of the chicken ' s coop is the lowest", "you can pay for keeping the supplies and the chickens for ever", "a coop is a newly - produced company", "the coops are not safe enough to feed the chickens"], "human": ["you can enjoy the Rent a Coop service after 18 months", "you can search online for any questions related to raising chickens", "you can pay 185 dollars a week for renting things to raise the chickens", "you can pay for keeping the supplies and the chickens for ever"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
