{"id": "5410", "article": "Andrew Holleman , a 12 - year - old boy , loved playing in the open land near his home . The land was wet and forested , and made a home for birds , other animals and many different plants . It made the perfect place for him to study and get to know the nature . He had seen some red - tail hawks , red foxes , wood turtles and other animals . He also found special native flowers . Suddenly it was announced that the \" empty \" land would be improved by a lot of houses on it . The plants would be removed , the animals would run away and most would probably die . Then the wet soil would be covered with extra grounds . When he heard about the news , he was not happy . He was very worried that the land ans water would be polluted . Andrew wrote down clearly all the research he had down about the area , and how the houses would affect the local environment . He sent letters to members of local government and television reporters . He also called on his neighbors to _ the building of the houses . Although he was only 12 years old , he had the courage and wisdom of a person much older . Andrew ' s teachers described him as gentle , shy and active . His classmates also admired how much he knew about local animals and plants , and the environment . Each day after school , Andrew went door - to - door , to ask the people to sign , who did not want the houses to be built . In only one month , he got the signatures of 250 people . In the end , the land remained a safe place for birds , animals and plants that belonged there . Andrew won many prizes for his brave and great work to stop the houses being built , and thus help save the environment .", "questions": "We can infer that", "options": {"model": ["the \" empty \" land would be replaced by a lot of houses", "the land would remain as it used to be", "the \" empty \" land would be improved by a lot of houses on it"], "human": ["the open land would be built into a park", "Andrew would soon work for the government", "the land would remain as it used to be"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
