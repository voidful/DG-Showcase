{"id": "382", "article": "I ' ve tried to explain compound interest to my eight - year - old daughter . When I have finished it , she summarizes back to me , \" So , you are saying if I put $ 100 in the bank , when I turn sixteen the bank will give me $ 200 ? \" She has already grasped more of the concept than I understood at her age , but she could n ' t clearly understand that until she sees them in action . One day I gave her a Ziploc bag with a handful of pennies and told her over the course of a week I wanted her to give me a penny a day . I would deposit the penny in \" The Bank of Dad \" and compound interest would begin to accumulate the day she deposited the penny . At the end of the week we would check her bank balance . Each day my daughter handed over one penny at the breakfast table and I deposited it in her bank . I gave her a \" receipt \" for her deposit and explained that she needed to keep up with the receipts to see how much money she had added to her account . In an effort to make this a little more realistic , I deposited a penny from my own piggy bank every other day to give her an additional four pennies at the end of the week . On Sunday evening we gathered receipts and confirmed she had deposited seven pennies in \" The Bank of Dad . \" Then I opened the old film container and counted out its contents - - all eleven pennies . \" Hey , there are four extra pennies in there ! \" I explained that her original seven pennies had grown to eleven pennies because every couple days the bank paid her a penny for letting them use her money - - that ' s interest . She paused and asked , \" Dad , what would happen if you deposited like a hundred million pennies in the bank ?", "questions": "What can we infer from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the author ' s daughter was very interested in the money .", "the father ' s daughter was eager to get some money .", "the author ' s daughter was very interested in the money she had put in the bank .", "the father used a good way to show his daughter about interest ."], "human": ["\" The Bank of Dad \" paid the girl a penny each day as interest .", "There were eleven pennies in the old film container in total .", "The writer ' s daughter was very puzzled with compound interest .", "The father used a good way to show his daughter about interest ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
