{"id": "5544", "article": "You may think that light pollution is n ' t something extraordinarily important . You may believe that every other type of pollution has a larger impact on the environment than light pollution does . But light pollution is serious . Light pollution , or \" sky glow \" , is the glow you can see at night above cities and towns . Light pollution is a problem that has been accompanying man ever since he started his first fire some 15 , 000 years ago . Light pollution is the light that comes from streetlights , buildings , parking lots and any other source of light that is reflected or directed into the atmosphere . Urban light pollution means that one - fifth of the world ' s population can no longer see the Milky Way with the naked eye . Many city kids , even if they did look through the orange smog above their heads , would probably see only a handful of stars . We have lost our view of the stars , and we have _ our night - time environment as well . Astronomers are calling for the dark places on Earth to be preserved as national parks . Lots of people find the ever - brightening night annoying , and animals that are programmed to prefer the dark may avoid a brightened habitat . Sea turtles can get lost searching for a beach to lay eggs , and their hatchlings may confuse over - lit beachfront resorts for the ocean horizon , wasting precious energy needed to find the sea and escape predators . Because their necks are n ' t yet long enough to see things far away , baby turtles rely on the mirror image of the moon to guide them to the sea , to begin their new life . A car may even hit a particular turtle , which was thinking the light from a nearby city was moonlight reflecting off the ocean waves . Birds that live in and around cities can die because of sky glow , too . The bright lights can blind them , leading to countless collisions with buildings and other tall structures . Reducing light pollution is not difficult . Light pollution is the easiest type of pollution to end . people can help reduce much sky glow by using lighting only when necessary . The stars above us are priceless heritage - - for not only for astronomers but for all humans . More of our children should be able to look up at night and see the Milk Way is not just a candy bar .", "questions": "Beacuse of light pollution , the sea turtles hatchlings may", "options": {"model": ["lose their sight of the stars in the city", "lose their sight of the stars", "be misled by bright lights from beachfront resorts"], "human": ["find the sea easily", "find the way to the sea with the help of bright lights", "be misled by bright lights from beachfront resorts"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
