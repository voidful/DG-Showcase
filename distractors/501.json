{"id": "501", "article": "On the night of July 6 , 1943 , a plane took off from an Air Force base in England to intercept German fighters over the English Channel . Piloting the plane was Captain Thomas Nash . Looking westward , Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row , moving at a fantastic rate of speed . An old experienced flyer , he had never seen anything like them . Thinking they might be a new German weapon , he decided to give chase . But when he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights , they disappeared . Captain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he was n ' t the last . His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World WarIIboth in Europe and the Far East . Pilots in the Korean War also reported seeing the strange lights . What were they ? No one knows for sure , but there is an interesting theory to account for them . According to this theory , the orange lights are space animals - - animals specially adapted to life in the upper atmosphere just as some creatures are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea . These space animals , the theory says , live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not visible from earth . They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from sunlight . Being almost pure energy themselves , they can adjust their bodies to glow at night . During the day they become invisible . Before World War II , continues the theory , there was little radiated energy available on the earth ' s surface . Then came the development of rockets , atomic reactors , and hydroelectric plants . The space creatures are attracted to these sources of energy of food . At night when there is no energy from sunlight , they go down into the lower levels in search of a meal . They may even drift into the range of human eyesight . This explains the fact that they have been sighted regularly from the earth since 1943 .", "questions": "The best statement of the main idea of this passage is that", "options": {"model": ["the orange lights are space animals", "captain nash had been the first to see the strange lights in the space creatures", "according to an interesting theory , the orange lights are space animals"], "human": ["Captain Nash saw twelve orange lights traveling at a fantastic rate of speed", "Captain Nash may have been the first to see lights in space", "according to an interesting theory , the orange lights are space animals"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
