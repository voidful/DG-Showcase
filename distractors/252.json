{"id": "252", "article": "Parents often believe that they have a good relationship with their teenagers . But last summer , Joanna and Henry noticed a change in their older son : suddenly he seemed to be talking far more to his friends than to his parents . \" The door to his room is always shut . \" Joanna noticed . Tina and Mark noticed similar changes in their 14 - year - old daughter . \" She used to cuddle up with me on the sofa and talk , \" said Mark . \" Now we joke that she does this only when she wants something . Sometimes she wants to be treated like a little girl and sometimes like a young lady . The problem is figuring out which time is which . \" Before age 11 , children like to tell their parents what ' s on their minds . \" In fact , parents are first on the list . \" said Michael Riera , author of Uncommon Sense for Parents with Teenagers . \" This completely changes during the teen years . \" Riera explained . \" They talk to their friends first , then maybe their teachers , and their parents last . \" Parents who know what ' s going on in their teenagers ' lives are in the best position to help them . To break down the wall of silence , parents should create chances to understand what their children want to say , and try to find ways to talk and write to them . And they must give their children a mental break , for children also need freedom , though young . Another thing parents should remember is that to be a friend , not a manager , with their children is a better way to know them .", "questions": "What troubles Tina and Mark most is that", "options": {"model": ["they ca n ' t read their daughter ' s mind exactly", "they ca n ' t talk with their children"], "human": ["their daughter talks with them only when she needs help", "they ca n ' t read their daughter ' s mind exactly"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
