{"id": "2495", "article": "I remember the first time that I was extremely happy . I was about 8 years old when for the first time , there was a computer in the classroom . I remember that my teacher allowed each student to take turns playing various educational games on the computer . One day , I found the source code for one of these games . Without knowing or being taught any programming language , I was able to figure out some _ of the BASIC code . Anyone who knows a bit of programming can tell you that I just give myself an infinite number of lives in the game , so I can continue playing forever . This was also my first introduction to algebra , and I did n ' t even know it at the time . This was a decisive moment in my life . For the first time that I can remember , I was quite happy because of what I was learning and what I was able to do . As a result , I became enthusiastic for the rest of my life about self - learning and computers , and I was quite happy doing them , too . I ' ve noticed that people who are truly content with life are enthusiastic in what they do . This enthusiasm , along with good health , is the key to being happy . It also leads to self - confidence and fulfillment in life , too . It may also lead to success , wealth , and achievements . Yes , success , wealth , or achievements seem to bring some people happiness , too . Yet , I do n ' t think they can indeed make people happy . I know plenty of people who are successful and wealthy . However , I also know several of the people with successful businesses are not happy with what they are doing . I know people who continuously buy themselves new toys , cars , computers , and televisions , yet they never seem content for too long . Please remember that happiness comes from enthusiasm , and happiness is the journey of life , not the destination .", "questions": "The author uses his own experience of being happy in order to tell us", "options": {"model": ["everyone who enjoys a happy life may succeed", "concentrating on what you love makes you happy", "how to make yourself happy"], "human": ["he has always been happy since his childhood", "one can solve any problem in life by himself", "concentrating on what you love makes you happy"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
