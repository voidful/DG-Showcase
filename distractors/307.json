{"id": "307", "article": "Dear Guys , I ' d like to talk to you about the two minutes of total embarrassments you put me through last night . You a group of fit , young men , were playing soccer on the field across from my apartment building , I , a beautiful looking young woman , was walking by with my groceries . That ' s when your ball came flying over the fence and landed at my feet . One of you came to me , and asked politely if I would throw the ball back to you . Fighting the urge to flee screaming down the street , I agreed . And I put my bags down , picked up the ball and with eyes half shut , threw it as hard as I could . It hit the middle of the fence and bounced right back to me . I picked up the ball again and threw the ball upward with all my strength . The ball once again hit slightly higher up on the fence and bounced back to me . This is the point where I start to blame you . Would n ' t it have been a better use of your time , and mine , if you had just walked around the fence and collected the ball then ? I was clearly struggling . And yet you all just stood there , staring . Seeing that you were n ' t going to get the ball yourselves , I become desperate . But I picked up the soccer ball for the third time . I forced a smile while crying inside as you patiently shouted words of support over the fence at me like I was a two - year - old holding a beech ball for the first time . \" Throw it granny - style ! \" one of you said . \" Just back up a little end throw it hard ! \" another offered And , most embarrassing of all , \" You can do it ! \" I know you thought you were being encouraging , but it only served to deepen the embarrassment . However , I accepted your advice , took a deep breath , and let it fly . It hid the edge of the - fence and bounced back to me . I hoped that I would have a heart attack and pass out , just so I ' d be put out of my misery . Alas , the heart attack did n ' t happen . Finally , I had to pick up the ball , walked close to the fence , and said angrily , \" Please just come top get it . \" And you did . And thanks", "questions": "The author wrote the letter to inform the footballers that", "options": {"model": ["they should throw the ball back to the soccer", "they should show concern over others ' feelings"], "human": ["she would n ' t throw anything else to them", "they should show concern over others ' feelings"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
