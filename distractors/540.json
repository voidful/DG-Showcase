{"id": "540", "article": "Ridgewood is a small , quiet town 20 miles from Manhattan . It is a typical suburban town , perfect for raising children away from the fast pace of the city . However , some Ridgewood kids feel as upset as if they were on the city ' s busy streets . In addition to hours of homework , Ridgewood ' s children are occupied with afterschool activities - - from swimming to piano to religious classes . Out of desperation one day , the town decided to schedule another activity . This one was called \" Ridgewood Family Night - - Ready , Set , Relax ! \" Instead of schedules filled with sports , music , or overtime at the office , some of the town ' s 25 , 000 residents decided to take the night off and stay home . For a few months before Family Night , a committee of volunteers worked hard to spread the word . Younger students took \" Save the Date for Me \" leaflets home to their parents . The mayor issued a statement , and schools and clubs agreed to cancel homework and meetings so families could relax and be together . The tension between a hope for a more relaxed lifestyle and the knowledge that the benchmark for success has been raised in recent years weighs heavily on the minds of the townspeople . Some parents like to recall a different kind of childhood , one without so many scheduled afterschool activities . However , these same parents feel obliged to make sure their children are prepared to survive in today ' s high - pressure work environment . They are afraid that any gap in their children ' s physical or intellectual development might mean they wo n ' t be admitted to the \" right \" universities and wo n ' t succeed in a more and more competitive world . Nevertheless , it seems that Family Night worked , at least to a point . Cars moved easily around Ridgewood ' s normally busy downtown streets , and stores and restaurants saw a drop in business . Some families ate supper together for the first time in months . Initially , there was great hope of taking back their lives . But sadly , few families believe that one night will change their lives . Many are sure that they will fall back into the habit of over - scheduling their children to be overachieving adults .", "questions": "According to the passage , the parents in Ridgewood", "options": {"model": ["have conflicting desires about what experiences to offer their children", "want their children to go to school", "are worried about their children ' s academic problems"], "human": ["are happy with the lifestyle they have chosen for themselves and the children", "are worried about their children ' s lacking of big ambition", "have conflicting desires about what experiences to offer their children"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
