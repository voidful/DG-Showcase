{"id": "285", "article": "Imagine having an idea , drawing it on paper , bringing it to a store and seeing it turned into a physical object . This is now possible with the help of 3D printers . Such machines were once used just by universities and big companies . But now , stores with 3D printing services are appearing around the United States . Bryan Jaycox and his wife opened The Build Shop LLC in Los Angeles two years ago . The store is filled with tools like a laser cutter , an industrial sewing machine and 3D printers . Bryan Jaycox requires $ 15 an hour to print an object . He also charges a fee depending on the size of the object and up to $ 50 an hour for design and labor services . The Jaycoxs also offer 3D printing classes for anyone who is interested . One of the students in a recent class was Ki Chong Tran . He plans to open a 3D printing business in Cambodia . \" The demand has been amazing . It ' s been much more than I would have imagined , \" said Ki Chong Tran . \" I think 3D printing is going to be huge . It ' s going to make a huge impact on society as a whole , \" he added . Mr Jaycox predicts that within five years , 3D printing technology could become more consumer friendly . But Ki Chong Tran says even current technology can make a difference in a developing country like Cambodia . \" With 3D printing you can give them tools , and you put it in their hands so they are responsible more for their own development . They learn skills beyond just learning English and becoming a tour guide or something like that or working at a bank . You can actually create things that give value to the world , \" said Ki Chong Tran . He says it ' s not just Cambodia but anywhere where there is a 3D printer , it can turn a good idea into reality .", "questions": "Bryan Jaycox opened The Build Shop LLC to", "options": {"model": ["sell 3d printers in the united states", "sell 3d printers", "sell 3d printing classes for anyone who is interested", "offer 3d printing classes and services"], "human": ["sell 3D printers and different kinds of tools", "produce all types of printing machines", "design different types of 3D printers", "offer 3D printing classes and services"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
