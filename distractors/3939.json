That was what Shari liked doing especially when she gave someone else something . I ' d seen her give away berries to everybody - - parking attendants , mail carriers , hairdressers . \" For me ? \" they ' d say , breaking into a smile . As a \" thank you \" , Shari took us out for dinner . But there was a 45 - munite wait at her favorite restaurant . \" No big deal . There ' s another place just up the road , \" she said , driving us there . This time we walked right in . While the waitress took our drink orders Shari reached into her handbag , pulling something out . \" I want you to have these , \" she said , handing the waitress a box of chocolate - dipped strawberries . \" Will she love those berries ! \" I said to myself . But the waitress seemed extremely surprised . She hardly let out a \" Thank you \" before grabbing the box and rushing into the kitchen . A few minutes later , the waitress returned with our iced tea . \" I apologize , \" she said . \" It ' s just . . . my best friend and I made an agreement to send each other something every Valentine ' s Day . But she passed last year . I did n ' t know how I ' d get through this day without her . Then you handed me that box . \" \" I ' m so sorry to hear that , \" said Shari . \" It ' s not much , but I hope you can enjoy them . \" \" Oh , I will , \" the waitress said . \" See , every year we always sent each other the same thing : a box of chocolate - dipped strawberries bought from our favorite store , The Berry Factory . \"", "questions": "Why did the waitress apologize to Shari ?", "options": {"model": ["because she did n ' t want to get through this day without shari", "because she did n ' t let out a \" thank you \" before .", "because she did n ' t express her thanks to shari"], "human": ["Because she had a bad service to Shari", "Because she did n ' t take Shari ' s drink order", "Because she did n ' t express her thanks to Shari"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
