{"id": "4403", "article": "How do you spend a usual holiday at home ? My alarm clock wakes me , which reminds me of school . I usually would sleep like a log , but today is a holiday and I have to be at the pool for swimming practice at a quarter to seven . About 30 swimmers show up for practice . An hour later , I ride my bike home . The suburbs are quiet in the morning , with few cars on the street . I know I should be studying German but instead I wander to my room , lie down on the bed and sleep like a log . When I open my eyes again , the first thing I see is the alarm clock . It ' s 10 : 40 and I have a basketball class in less than 20 minutes . With the help of a shortcut I arrive on time . About 15 kids and I spend the rest of the morning \" shooting hoops \" . A bus takes us home , and I see a neighbour walking her dogs . It ' s past noon . Lunch is \" dousha baozi \" , which my younger brother Richard does n ' t eat . He devours part of a cake from the fridge . I wonder if I should practise on the keyboard , study German , finish my homework , play chess , read or sleep like a log . I decide to play computer games for an hour and promise myself that I ' ll work on German later . As the computer games hit higher and higher levels , Richard and I become more and more bored . He has been aching for someone his own age to play with , and I write , he is _ . He is too sleepy . I think I ' ll turn off this computer and take him to the park . Then maybe I ' ll call on some of my old classmates . Holidays can be a time to learn , a time to play , a time to grow or a time to sleep like a log . Whatever you choose to do with your time , do something that you ' ll remember !", "questions": "What did the writer NOT do during the day ?", "options": {"model": ["playing basketball .", "walking his dog .", "playing computer games with his brother ."], "human": ["Playing computer games .", "Playing basketball .", "Walking his dog ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
