{"id": "3485", "article": "You and your friends are settling into your seats . The new Spider - Man movie is about to start and you ' ve got the snacks : soda and popcorn . Food is part of what makes the movie fun . Just as the lights go out , you catch a slight smell of . . . tuna fish ? ! You turn your head , searching for the source . Then you spot him : A couple rows back , some guy is enjoying a tuna fish sandwich . How ' s he get that in here ? You wonder . Then you remember how much you paid for your snacks . What invites the unwelcome outside food is probably the price . Why pay $ 5 for a bag of M & Ms when you can get them for a dollar at the corner store ? Earlier this year , a Michigan man decided to fight for his right to snack . Joshua Thompson is suing his local theatre after it banned outside food . He argues the ban breaks a Michigan law that prevents business from charging extremely high prices . However , most legal experts believe Thompson has little chance of winning his case though he does have a point : 85 percents out of every dollar of treats a movie theatre sells is pure profit . The truth is that movie theatres are more in the snack business than the movie business . A huge part of the ticket income goes to the Hollywood studio . This makes sense , since the studio have to pay the costs of movie production and advertising . But that often does n ' t leave much cash for the theater , which also has its own running costs . If customers stopped buying food , owners would have to raise ticket prices even higher . Of course , there ' s another reason to think twice before bringing food into the movies : It ' s against the rules . Breaking those rules can be unpleasant consequences , too . Some theatres will kick you out if they catch you . Even without the threat of punishment , we should follow rules all the time - - - - - out of respect . Here ' s a good idea : Eat before the movie .", "questions": "What do we know about Joshua Thomphson ?", "options": {"model": ["he does n ' t like the food at the cinema .", "he is likely to lose the case .", "he is n ' t interested in the food he eats ."], "human": ["He broke a Michigan law .", "He was forbidden to have snacks at the theatre .", "He is likely to lose the case ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
