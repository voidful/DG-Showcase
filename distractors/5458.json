Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity , the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to be consistent to a stereotype , a US study says . Boys at single - sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their abilities to express their emotions , rather than feeling they had to obey to the \" boy code \" of hiding their emotions to be a \" real man \" . The findings of the study are against the received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls . Tony Little , headmaster of Eton , warned that boys were being ignored by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls . He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls . The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills . But in single - sex schools teachers can adjust lessons to boys ' learning style , letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom , wrote the study ' s author , Abigail James of the University of Virginia . Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with \" boy - focused \" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them . Because boys generally have sharper vision , learn best through touch , and are physically more active , they need to be given \" hands - on \" lessons where they are allowed to walk around . \" Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modem type in which violence and sexism are major themes , \" James wrote . Single - sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to give in to a stereotype that men should be \" masterful and in charge \" in relationships . \" In mixed schools boys feel pressed to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means , \" the study reported .", "questions": "According to Abigail James , one of the advantages of single - sex schools is", "options": {"model": ["teaching can be adapted to suit the characteristics of boys", "teaching can make boys more active", "teaching can enable boys to express their emotions"], "human": ["boys can focus on their lessons without being absent - minded", "boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in", "teaching can be adapted to suit the characteristics of boys"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
