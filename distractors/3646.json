Then , why do people call them \" giraffes \" ? A giraffe , they say , is an animal that sticks its neck out , can see places far away and has a large heart . It lives a quiet life and moves about in an easy and beautiful way . In the same way , a \" giraffe \" can be a person who likes to \" stick his or her neck out \" for other people , always watches for future happenings , has a warm heart for people around , and at the same time lives a quiet and beautiful life himself or herself . \" The Giraffe Project \" is a 10 - year - old group which finds and honors \" giraffes \" in the US and in the world . The group wants to teach people to do something to build a better world . The group members believe that a person should n ' t draw his or her head back ; instead , they tell people to \" stick their neck out \" and help others . Claude and Louris , Hankins and Pearson are only a few of the nearly 1 , 000 \" giraffes \" that the group found and honored . Claude and Louris were getting old and they left their work with some money that they saved for future use . One day , however , they saw a homeless man looking for a place to keep warm and they decided that they should \" stick their neck out \" and give him some help . Today , they lived in Friends ' House , where they invite twelve homeless people to stay every night . Police officers Hankins and Pearson work in a large city . They see crimes every day and their work is sometimes dangerous . They work hard for their money .
