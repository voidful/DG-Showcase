{"id": "4233", "article": "\" BANG ! \" the door caused a reverberation . It was just standing there , with Father standing on one side , and I on the other side . We were both in great anger . \" Never set foot in this house again ! \" stormed Father . With tears welling up in my eyes , I rushed out of the flat and ran along the street . The street lights were shining , causing rather sad - feeling . I wandered aimlessly . A young father who held a child in his arms walked past me . I felt as if I saw my childhood from another space : happy and carefree . But now . . . I do n ' t know whether it is because I have grown up or because Dad is getting old . We differ in our ways of thinking . He always puts his opinions and codes of behaviour on me . Whenever I do something wrong , he never admits it . We are just like two people coming from two different worlds . It feels like there is an iron door between us that can never be opened . I wandered in the streets , without a destination in mind . My heart was frozen on this hot summer night . As I walked on there were fewer and fewer people on the streets , until I had only the street lights to keep me company . When I finally reached the high - rise apartment block in which I lived , I saw that the light was still on . I thought to myself : \" Is Father waiting for me , or is he still angry with me ? \" In fact , it was nothing . Perhaps , Dad was throwing away some of his old stamps . Perhaps he thought they were useless . I never had the courage to tell him that I liked collecting stamps . I ca n ' t stand his outrageous words : \" I ca n ' t throw you away , let alone these old papers ? \" All the lights were off except Father ' s . Dad was always like this . Maybe he did n ' t know how to express himself . After shouting at me , he never showed any mercy or any moments of regret . After an argument he has the habit of creeping up in my sleep and then tucking me underneath the covers . This was how he always was . He has been a leader for so long that telling everyone else what to do has become his second nature .", "questions": "What made the writer think of his childhood ?", "options": {"model": ["the sight of the work in the street lights .", "the sight of a father with a child in his arms .", "the sight of the iron door .", "the sight of a child in his arms ."], "human": ["The sight of the street lights .", "The sight of the empty street .", "The sight of light in his own house .", "The sight of a father with a child in his arms ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
