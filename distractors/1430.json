Most couples do not have maids or relatives living with them , and they need to have someone watch the children if they want to go out . Another way is by mowing lawn in summer and clearing snow from sidewalks and driveways in winter . Many people mow their own lawns , but often people prefer to give the job to a neighbor ' s child . In winter , snow clearing from streets and highways is the government ' s responsibility . Homeowners or tenants , however , must clear sidewalks and driveways .
