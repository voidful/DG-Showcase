{"id": "2236", "article": "When people reunite with their loved ones , it ' s usually a wildly happy moment . But what is their most common response to seeing them again ? It may seem strange , but most of the time they break down in tears . Now a group of psychologists from Yale University in the US say they have found the reason why , and that crying tears of joy may well be the body ' s way of restoring emotional balance . \" _ seem to take place when people are unable to tolerate strong positive emotions , and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions , \" Oriana Aragon , the lead researcher , told The Telegraph . Aragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants ' emotional responses to different things , including happy reunions and cute babies . Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things - - to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby ' s face or even tell them \" I want to eat you up ! \" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly . \" We want a happy , middle spot . Extreme is not good . It ' s hard on our bodies , \" Aragon told The Washington Post . There are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction . At an exciting concert , fans scream in horror at their idols . People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears . \" These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions , which is importantly related to mental and physical health , the quality of relationship with others , and even how well people work together , \" said Aragon . The psychologists then went further and claimed that the reverse was also true . Strong negative feelings may also bring out positive expressions . For example , people often laugh when they are nervous or they are in a difficult or frightening situation . Also , have you ever seen a character smiling at a time of extreme sadness in a movie ? Their acting is not over the top , as reacting with this type of expression is just human nature , said researchers", "questions": "The writer wrote the passage in order to", "options": {"model": ["inform readers about the effect of crying and laughing .", "tell readers how to express and control their emotions ."], "human": ["entertain readers by relating some happy occasions .", "inform readers about the effect of crying and laughing ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
