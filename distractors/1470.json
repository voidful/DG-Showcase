{"id": "1470", "article": "When you choose a freezer , remember it ' s probably going to be with you for a long time . So it ' s important to know which freezer is right for your needs . First , decide if you want an upright or chest model . Uprights are more convenient . Their storage space is more accessible and they take up less floor area . However , chest models are more energy - efficient because less cold air escapes when they are open . If you are buying an upright , you ' ll have to choose between frostless or manual defrost . Chest freezers are always manual . Frostless freezers automatically defrost at present intervals and remove the water . Manual models must be defrosted by hand every few months or whenever frost pile up to about a quarter of an inch . To help your freezer reach a ripe old age , try to find a spot that ' s cool , dry , and away fromdrafts . Drafts and heat will raise the freezer ' s cabinet temperature , which makes it work harder to keep cool . That means wasted energy . That means wasted energy and a shortened life . Dry air is important because highhumidity can cause the freezer to rust outside and frost up inside . With proper care , a freezer can serve you for 15 years or more . Regular cleaning and simple maintenance will help it maintain a zero - degree temperature and keep it smelling fresh and looking almost new . Frostless models requires less care than manual defrost freezers . The inside of a frostless unit should be washed periodically with warm water and baking soda or a mild soap , rinse , and dried . Good habits go a long way toward a freezer that runs efficiently . To get the most from your freezer , check regularly to make sure it ' s providing a true zero - degree temperature . Keep the freezer at least three - quarters full . The emptier it get , the more energy is wasted . If more than three pounds of food per cubic foot of storage space is added every 24 hours , the resulting high or low temperature can damage the food .", "questions": "What can we learn from this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the best way to keep the cold can be used .", "it is more important to keep the freezer at the temperature of zero - degree .", "you should n ' t use the cold air unless you are open .", "it is better to keep the freezer at least three - quarters full of water than the usual temperature ."], "human": ["It is an easy task to have your freezer serve you for 15 years .", "You do n ' t have to worry about defrosting if you choose a chest freezer .", "The opening of freezers has nothing to do with energy - saving .", "It is more important to keep the freezer at the temperature of zero - degree ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
