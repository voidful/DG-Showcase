{"id": "1488", "article": "My brother - in - law opened the bottom drawer of my sister ' s bureau and picked out a wonderful skirt . \" Jan bought this the first time we went to New York , at least 8 or 9 years ago . She never wore it . She was saving it for a special occasion . \" Well , I guess this is the occasion . He took the skirt from me and put it on the bed . His hands touched the soft material for a moment , then he shut the drawer and turned to me , \" Do n ' t ever save anything for a special occasion . Every day you ' re alive is a special occasion . \" I ' m still thinking about his words , and they ' ve changed my attitude to life . I ' m spending more time with my family and friends and less time in committee meetings . Whenever possible , life should be a pattern of experience to enjoy , not suffer . I ' m trying to recognize these moments now and treasure them . \" Someday \" and \" one of these days \" are being lost from my vocabulary . If it ' s worth seeing or hearing or doing , I want to see and hear and do it now . I ' m not sure what my sister would have done if she had known she would n ' t have tomorrow . I think she would have called family members and a few close friends . She might have called a few former friends to apologize and mend her fences for past things . I like to think she would have gone out for a Chinese dinner , her favorite food . If I knew that my hours were limited , those little things left undone would make me angry . Angry because I put off seeing good friends whom I was going to get in touch with someday . Angry and sorry because I did n ' t tell my husband and daughter often enough how much I truly love them . I ' m trying very hard not to put off , hold back , or save anything that would add laughter to our lives . And every morning when I open my eyes , I tell myself that every day , every minute , and every breath truly , is . . . a gift from God .", "questions": "Which of the following is not the writer ' s attitude to life ?", "options": {"model": ["changing our attitude to life as much as possible", "attending social activities as often as possible", "taking care of her family members and friends regularly", "persuading friends to make friends with others"], "human": ["Spending more time staying with family every day .", "Enjoying life and valuing every day .", "Trying to get along well with friends", "Attending social activities as often as possible"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
