Lesson 1 : Ways of creative thinking are needed Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg both dropped out of college . They prefer to teach themselves because they like to develop their own ways of thinking . They think standard ways of teaching might stop people from being creative and having new ideas . Lesson 2 : The answer might not be what you expect Find your answers from facts - - not start with an expectation of what you will find . Stephen Jacobsen from Northwestern University believed what he was taught : that water on Earth came from icy comets or planets which hit into Earth . However , by studying a special rock , he discovered that it acts like a sponge . This suggests that Earth ' s water may have come from inside , driven to the surface to form the oceans , by geological activity . \" I had a pretty hard time making others believe it , \" he said . \" But thinking about the fact that you may the first person to see something for the first time does n ' t happen very often . When it does , it ' s amazing . \" _ Years of planning went into a recent achievement in space travel . The European Space Agency ' s \" Philae \" , a robot landing craft , met up with Comet 67P , which is 480 million kilometers away . The trip from Earth by \" Philae \" had taken ten years ! The scientists had no idea what the surface of the comet would be like . If the landing failed , it would be impossible to get information from the spacecraft . Twenty years of work would have been wasted . When \" Philae \" tried to land , it bounced away from the comet ' s icy surface twice . Luckily , however , \" Philae \" landed successfully and began sending information back to Earth .", "questions": "Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg did n ' t finish college because", "options": {"model": ["they preferred to learn by themselves", "they did n ' t have enough time to make others believe it", "they did n ' t think it easy to get information from the spacecraft"], "human": ["they needed standard ways of teaching", "their teachers did n ' t like their new ideas", "they preferred to learn by themselves"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
