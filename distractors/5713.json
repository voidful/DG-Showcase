You do n ' t need to worry about people who have beautiful houses with large gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and a lot of money and so on . Why ? Because those who have big houses may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads in their free time . In fact , happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it . When you are in trouble at school , your friends will help you ; when you are studying hard at your lessons , your parents are always taking good care of you ; When you get success , your friends will say congratulations to you ; When you do something wrong , people around you will help you to correct it . All your happiness is always around you . Happiness is not the same as money . It is a feeling of your heart . When you are poor , you can also say you are very happy , because you have something else that ca n ' t be bought with money . When you meet with difficulties , you can say loudly you are very happy , because you have more chances to challenge yourself . So you should not always say you are poor and you have bad luck . As the saying goes , life is like a revolving door . When it closes , it also opens . If you take every chance you get , you can be a happy and lucky person . , .
