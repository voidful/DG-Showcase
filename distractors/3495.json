The cat then decided to make all serve her in her wise way . To carry out her design , she climbed to the nest of the eagle , saying , \" Destruction is preparing for you and for me too , unfortunately . The wild pig , whom you see daily digging up the earth , wishes to uproot the tree , so she may on its fall seize our families as food for her young . \" Having thus frightened the eagle out of her senses , she crept down to the cave of the pig , saying , \" Your children are in great danger , for as soon as you go out to find food , the eagle is prepared to jump upon one of your little pigs . \" Having filled these fears into the pig , she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the tree . When night came she went out silently and obtained food for herself and her children , but pretending to be afraid , she kept a lookout all through the day . Meanwhile , the eagle , full of fear of the pig , sat still on the branches , and the pig , terrified by the eagle , did not dare to go out from her cave . Thus they both , along with their families , starved from hunger , and afforded good food for the cat and her children .", "questions": "What was the pig frightened of ?", "options": {"model": ["the eagle could n ' t find the food for her young .", "the eagle would attack her children .", "the eagle would kill her young child ."], "human": ["The eagle would cheat her away .", "She could not find enough food .", "The eagle would kill her young child ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
