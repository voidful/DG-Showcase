{"id": "5575", "article": "Do you love Beats headphones , True Religion jeans , and UGG shoes ? These are some of the most popular brands around . They are also expensive . But some experts say they are not much better than cheaper brands . For example , Jim Wilcox works for Consumer Reports . He tested all kinds of headphones . He says that $ 80 Koss Pro headphones provide basically the same quality and comfort as Beats . So why do people pay twice or even 10 times as much for the hottest brands ? Experts say it ' s because fashionable , expensive brands send a message . Brands say \" I belong \" or \" I can afford it . \" Some people think that expensive brand names are worth the price . They say that some designer clothes really are top quality and that they last longer than cheaper brands . Some teenagers choose to wear popular brands because these brands make them feel good about themselves . Alexandra Allam , 17 , likes to buy brand - name products . \" I ' d rather spend the extra money to get something I know I ' ll be satisfied with , \" she says . Her friend Emmy Swan agrees , saying \" As long as you can afford it , it seems reasonable to buy what you want . \" But not all teenagers agree . \" Spending hundreds of dollars for designer sunglasses is stupid and unreasonable , \" says Daniel Steinbrecher , 16 . \" It ' s fake happiness . \" People who are against wearing expensive brand names say that many designer brands are n ' t any better . \" It ' s wasteful to buy things just because they are popular , \" says Edmund Williams , 15 . \" You ' ll feel better if you buy things because you like them . If you have extra money to spend , it would be better to give it to people in need . \"", "questions": "The example of Jim ' s report wants to tell us", "options": {"model": ["famous brands are more expensive than ordinary brands", "less - known brands may offer the same quality as name brands", "famous brands are much better than ordinary brands", "cheap brands are more popular"], "human": ["popular brands make people comfortable", "Koss Pro headphones are better than Beats", "the hottest brands are of the highest quality", "less - known brands may offer the same quality as name brands"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
