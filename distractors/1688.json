Tisich announced . - - You see , your mother has been offered a post as co - director of a television station in Chicago . Unfortunately , the station is not here . After thinking long and hard about it , we ' ve concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago .

Marc simply said , - - We ca n ' t go - - I ca n ' t leave all my friends . I ' d rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons ! The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August , Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving . However , he showed no signs of accepting the news , refusing to pack his belongings . When the morning of the move arrived , Marc was nowhere to be found . His parents called Tommy Lyon ' s house , but Mrs . Lyons said she had n ' t seen Marc . Mrs . Tisich became increasingly concerned , while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly .

Marc did n ' t take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house , wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection .", "questions": "The conflict in this story was caused by", "options": {"model": ["mr . and mrs . tisich ' s quarrel", "mr . and mrs . tisich ' s quarrels .", "mr . and mrs . tisich ' s quarrels with their parents", "marc ' s disagreement with his parents about their move"], "human": ["a quarrel between Tommy Lyons and Marc", "Marc and Rachel ' s different tempers", "Mr . and Mrs .
