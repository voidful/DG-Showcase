{"id": "1777", "article": "Most people think of racing when they see greyhounds and believe they need lots of exercise . They can actually be quite lazy ! Greyhounds are good at fast races but not long - distance running . They do need regular exercise but they like to run for a short burst and then get back on the bed or a comfortable seat . Another misunderstanding is that greyhounds must be aggressive because they are big in size . In fact greyhounds love people and are gentle with children . Greyhounds can live for 12 - 14 years but usually only race for two or three years , and after that they make great pets . They do n ' t need a lot of space , do n ' t make a lot of noise , and do n ' t eat a lot for their size . Normally , greyhounds can be as tall as 90 cm . There is , however , a small - sized greyhound , which stands only 33 cm . Greyhounds come in a variety of colors . Grey and yellowish - brown are the most common . Others include black , white , blue , red and brown or a mix of these . Greyhounds have smooth body coats , low body fat and are very healthy . Because they ' re slim they do n ' t have the leg problems like other dogs the same height . But they do feel the cold , especially since they would much rather be at home in bed than walking around outside .", "questions": "The text is written mainly", "options": {"model": ["to tell people the importance of grey dogs", "to let people know more about greyhounds", "to tell people how to raise a horse", "to describe different kinds of dogs"], "human": ["to tell people how to raise greyhounds", "to explain why greyhounds are aggressive", "to describe greyhounds of different colors", "to let people know more about greyhounds"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
