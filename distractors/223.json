{"id": "223", "article": "Mr . Laurence was not allowed to see Beth , and Meg felt unhappy writing letters to her mother saying nothing about Beth ' s illness . Jo nursed Beth night and day , but the time came when Beth did not know her and called for her mother . Jo was frightened , and Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth , but Hannah said there was no danger yet . Then a letter came saying that Mr . March was worse and could not think of coming home for a long time . How dark the days seemed . How sad and lonely . The sisters worked and waited as the shadow of death lay over the once happy home . It was then that Meg realized how rich she had been in the things which really mattered - - love , peace , good health . And Jo , watching her little sister , thought about how unselfish Beth always was - - living for others and trying to make home a happy place for all who came there . Amy , sad and lonely at Aunt March ' s house , just wanted to come home so that she could do something to help Beth . On the first day of December , the doctor came in the morning . He looked at Beth , then said quietly , ' If Mrs . March can leave her husband , I think she should come home now . ' Jo threw on her coat and ran out into the snow to send a telegram . When she arrived back , Laurie came with a letter saying that Mr . March was getting better again . This was good news , but Jo ' s face was so unhappy that Laurie asked , ' What is it ? Is Beth worse ? ' ' I ' ve sent for Mother , ' said Jo , beginning to cry . ' Beth does n ' t know us any more . ' Laurie held her hand and whispered , ' I ' m here , Jo . Hold on to me . Your mother will be here soon , and then everything will be all right .
