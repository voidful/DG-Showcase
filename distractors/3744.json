{"id": "3744", "article": "A recent study suggests that teens ' relationship with parents , friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they do n ' t get a good night ' s sleep . David Maume , a sociologist and sleep researcher , analyzed federal health data , which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12 , and then again at 15 . He found that family dynamics have much to do with how well kids sleep . Teens , who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them , tended to sleep better . However , families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens ' sleep . And problems at school also affected teens ' sleep . Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep . As did good relationships with friends . Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night ' s sleep . These add up to what makes lots of sense : a general feeling of well - being helps teens sleep . If we ' re happy and contented , we ' re much more likely to sleep better than if we ' re sad and anxious . Now , of course , teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking . Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime , but also about limiting technology , kids slept better . It ' s a finding that seems obvious , but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers . Clearly , teenagers are n ' t getting 9 to 10 hours a night , which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep , including poor academic performance , colds and stress .", "questions": "What is the passage mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["teens ' parents and friends have a good sleep .", "teens ' sleep is linked to their relationship with people around them .", "teens should have a good sleep .", "teens ' social activities affect their study ."], "human": ["Lack of adequate sleep puts teens at risk of many bad consequences .", "Modern technology has something to do with teens ' sleep problems .", "It is necessary for teens to join in sports and positive social activities .", "Teens ' sleep is linked to their relationship with people around them ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
