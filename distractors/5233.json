Many people think high - - tech products have affected us because we spend more time playing on computers , watching TV and using our mobile phones to talk , text and play games . Our bodies : Levels of obesity are rising , especially young children . But this is n ' t just a problem about what we eat . Many people , especially teenagers , like sitting in front of TV sets or computers for hours , just watching or playing games . As a result , they do less exercise . Our brains : Research into the effects on the human brain while playing computer games is ongoing . Recent studies have looked at the impact on beta brainwave activity , which is important for emotional development , planning and self - control . Though we have n ' t evidence to show how it affects us , researchers think that tiredness may affect the levels of beta brainwave activity , and sitting in front of a TV set or computer for a long time easily causes one to feel tired . So parents who do n ' t want to spoil their children ' s fun should control the time they spend on the computer . Communication : As leading computer game consumers , are we spending too much time in front of computers ? Does it mean that we spend less time communicating with other people ?
