The German rail operator has launched a bicycle - hire scheme designed for simple one - way trips . \" It ' s a new concept , \" said Andreas Knie , head of the project . Users must first register with Call - A - Bike at a cost of 15 euros ( US $ 14 . 7 ) . With a simple phone call , they can hire one of the many bikes parked outside stations , at a cost of 3 to 5 cents per minute . At the end of their journey , they ring a computer and tell it where the bike is parked . The bikes are available 24 hours a day , seven days a week . No one will be breaking speed records with Call - A - Bike bicycles . They weigh in at 25 kilograms , at least double the weight of a normal bicycle , though they do have eight gears . \" They are pretty heavy , but we do n ' t want people taking them on the train or into the subway , \" Knie said . They are also designed with parts that do not fit a normal bicycle . Even the screws are irregular and the bike looks so odd that thieves would stand out . Vandalism and theft have led to the downfall of previous schemes which date back toAmsterdam ' s 1966 \" White Bike \" scheme . In that short - lived experiment , anti - establishment groups painted bikes white and left them around the Dutch capital . However , many were taken permanently and repainted , while the police took away others on the basis that ownerless bikes were street rubbish . Copenhagen , Vienna and Helsinki also have free bike schemes , in which users deposit a coin in Copenhagen ' s case 20 crowns ( US $ 2 . 50 ) - - to free a bike from a rack . \" The advantage these schemes have is ease of use . But because they ' re so cheap , people tend to hold on to the bikes and then there are none on the streets , \"", "questions": "What can be inferred from the text ?", "options": {"model": ["a - bike bicycles are not available in all in the world .", "a - bicycles are not allowed to be used in all the streets .", "germanyis the first country to build a bicycle - hire scheme .", "germanyhas taken some measures to stop the bicycles for rent from being taken away ."], "human": ["Bicycles for rent have become as common as newspaper stands and mail boxes on Germany ' s street corners .", "The bikes in Germanyare available 24 hours a day , seven days a week .", "German bicycles for rent are designed specially so that they will draw people ' s attention .", "Germanyhas taken some measures to stop the bicycles for rent from being taken away ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
