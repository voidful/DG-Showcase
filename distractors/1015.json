{"id": "1015", "article": "At present , in many American cities especially , many teachers in the public schools say they are underpaid . They point to jobs such as secretary or truck driver , which often pay more to start than of a teacher . In many other fields , such as law , medicine , computer science , a beginning worker may make more than a teacher who has taught for several years . Teaching has never been a profession that attracted people interested in high salaries . It is by history a profession that has provided rewards in addition to money - - the satisfaction of sharing knowledge , of influencing others , of guiding young people . But in the past several years , there are more difficulties in teaching , for many , than there are rewards . Unruly students , especially in big cities , large classes and a lack of support from the public in terms of money and understanding have led many public school teachers to leave the profession . As a result , many of the best students , who would have chosen teaching as their life career in the past , are going into other fields . Another reason for this change in teacher candidates is the changing status of women in the United States . Until the late 1960s and 1970s , one of the most popular choices for women was teaching . But as other professions , such as law and medicine opened up to women , women stopped pouring into teacher training programs . Thus , a major pool of excellent candidates for the teaching profession dwindled . Bit by bit government officials and others realized that the status of the teacher had suffered . They talked about change . But the change in a vast society like the United States is not easy . People ' s attitudes have formed over many years , and sometimes change takes many years .", "questions": "Many public school teachers turn to other professions because", "options": {"model": ["they lack the support from the public in terms of money", "the difficulties of teaching as well as a lack of money , support and understanding"], "human": ["the unruly students and large classes", "the difficulties of teaching as well as a lack of money , support and understanding"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
