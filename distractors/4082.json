Although the common person will say \" thank you \" nearly 5 , 000 times a year , one in three are more likely to add a \" cheers \" or \" ta \" where it ' s needed to show they are fashionable . One in twenty now say \" nice one \" instead , while the younger are more likely to offer a \" cool \" than a \" thank you \" . \" Merci \" , \" fab \" and even \" gracias \" were also listed as common phrases to use , as \" much appreciated \" . One in twenty who took part in the survey of 2 , 000 people by the Food Network UK for Thank You Day , which is marked on November 24 , 2011 , said a formal \" thank you \" was now not often needed in everyday conversation . More than one in ten adults said they regularly wo n ' t say thank you if they are in a bad mood . Most people stated that saying thank you was something that their parents trained them . A huge 70 percent of those questioned will say thank you to a person ' s face without even meaning it , while one fifth avoid saying it when they know they should . It seems our friends and family get the stress of our bad manners . Half of them admit they ' re not good at thanking those closest to them . Many of them explain that they do n ' t say thank you because their family \" already know I ' m grateful \" . When spoken words wo n ' t do , it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people . One third will still send a handwritten thank - you note - - - but 45 percent admit it ' s been more than six months since they tried to send one . A quarter of British people say \" thank you \" with food , with 23 percent cooking a meal to show their appreciation to someone . Another 15 percent bake a cake . It follows that 85 percent of people will be angry because of not getting the gratitude they feel they should receive .", "questions": "It can be learned from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["\" thank you \" is more important than \" thank you \"", "a thank - you note is still appreciated by most people", "\" thank you \" is more important than \" thank you \" in a good mood"], "human": ["people should avoid saying \" thank you \" nowadays", "people in a bad mood never say \" thank you \"", "a thank - you note is still appreciated by most people"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
