{"id": "1000", "article": "Experts have put forward detailed plans for a tunnel to join Taiwan with the Chinese mainland . The shortest proposed route would be 126 kilometers - - more than twice the length of the English Channel Tunnel . And the longest proposed route would be 207 kilometers . A recent conference in xiamen , Fujian Province brought together more than 70 experts . The event was cosponsored by universities from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland . Fujian is the province where both proposed mutes would begin . There is no direct passenger access between the mainland and Taiwan by air or sea at the moment . Experts say that it is better to start research sooner rather than later , although there is a lack of government funding . There are no technical problems t0 build a Taiwan tunnel . But it will require an improved political relationship across the Straits . A professor of TsinghHa University said , \" A special feature of huge projects is that the period of preparation is longer than the period of construction . \" For example , he said , the English channel Tunnel took 14 years of planning and had been discussed for two centuries . And preparations for the huge Three Corges dam on the Yangze River began in the 1950s . The xiamen conference focused on the longest southern route , which would use the Taiwan - controlled islands of Jinmen and Penghu as steppingstones . The first stage of the new project could be a bridge to cross the five kilometers between Xiamen and Jinmen . This would mean that traveling from Xiamen to Jinmen by car would only take five minutes . The longest tunnel now being planned anywhere in the world is the 54 - kilometer land tunnel to link Lyon in France with Turin in Italy . The tunnel will not be completed until 2015 - 2020 .", "questions": "What is the possible difficulty in carrying out the plan ?", "options": {"model": ["improving the relationship between taiwan and the mainland .", "persuading people to take part in the project .", "persuading people to travel from the mainland to the mainland ."], "human": ["The detailed plans for the tunnel .", "The technical problems with the tunnel .", "Improving the relationship between Taiwan and the mainland ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
