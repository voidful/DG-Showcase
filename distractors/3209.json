{"id": "3209", "article": "TOKYO - - Lonely astronauts on the International Space Station ( ISS ) may soon be getting a robot friend from Japan . Japan ' s space agency is considering putting a talking humanoid robot on the ISS to watch the work while astronauts are asleep , monitor their health and stress levels and communicate to Earth through the microblogging site Twitter . Japan ' s space agency JAXA announced this week that it is looking at a plan to send a humanoid robot to the space station in 2013 that could communicate with the ground through Twitter - - primarily feeding photos , rather than original ideas - - and provide astronauts with \" comfort and companionship \" . Following up on US NASA ' s \" Robonaut \" R2 program , which is set for launch on the Discovery shuttle next week , the Japanese robot would be part of a larger effort to create and refine robots that can be used by the elderly , JAXA said in a statement . Japan is one of the leading countries in robotics and has a rapidly aging society with one of the world ' s longest life expectancies . Improving robot communication capabilities could help elderly people on Earth by providing a nonintrusive means of monitoring the robot owner ' s health and vital signs and sending information to emergency responders if there is an abnormality , JAXA said . \" We are thinking in terms of a very humanlike robot that would have facial expressions and be able to talk with the astronauts , \" said JAXA ' s Satoshi Sano . The robot was being developed with the advertising and communications giant Dentsu Inc and a team at Tokyo University . The NASA project has a humanlike head , hands and arms and uses the same tools as station crew members . The \" Robonaut \" called R2 is intended to carry out maintenance tasks in the station ' s Destiny lab . NASA says it hopes that humanoid robots could one day stand in for astronauts during spacewalks or perform tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans . For now , the $ 2 . 5 million NASA robot is limited to activities within the lab .", "questions": "From the passage we can know", "options": {"model": ["the \" robonaut \" is a robot that can be used by human beings", "future astronauts will become less lonely and more comfortable with the help of the robot", "the \" robonaut \" is a robot that can be used by the elderly and young", "robots can help elderly people in space"], "human": ["robots could completely take the place of human astronauts in the future", "the robot program , having cost $ 2 . 5 million , can carry out all tasks", "many Japanese universities joined in the robot program", "future astronauts will become less lonely and more comfortable with the help of the robot"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
