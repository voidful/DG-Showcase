{"id": "2624", "article": "A hoarder is someone who is unable or unwilling to throw items away , and the disposal of items causes them considerable pain . When people hoard a massive amount of objects , it takes over the inhabitable spaces of their home . As the collection grows , they are unable to do simple , _ activities such as cooking a meal or watch TV . Sometimes the hoarding is so severe that parts of their homes become inaccessible . But among the many problems that such behavior brings about , the most significant are the health risks . Once hallways and windows are blocked , hoarders are at the risk of dying in a fire , since they no longer have a clear path of evacuation . Things that are piled up high can fall on top of the homeowner , or a person trying to climb over a pile of objects can experience a fall . There is also the problem of sanitation . Areas where food ca n ' t be properly cleaned begin to attract insects , and bathrooms that are full of many possessions can no longer be washed . Unfortunately , the serious effect of the problem can become worse for two reasons . One is that since the behavior progress behind closed doors , people can accumulate collections of objects for years before friends or family members become aware of the problem . A second reason is that hoarders often do n ' t recognize that they have a problem , and will continue to live in denial until they get professional help . When attempting to make a diagnosis , psychologists do n ' t regard hoarding as a disorder in itself . Instead , it ' s often seen as a symptom of obsessive - compulsive disorder , depression , or anxiety . The mental health community has only recently begun an intensive study of boarding , and more research is needed in order to understand its causes and find effective treatment .", "questions": "According to the passage , which of the following statements is TRUE ?", "options": {"model": ["symptoms of hoarding ca n ' t be easily noticed since it progresses quietly .", "hoarding is a serious effect of the problem .", "most of the people who are able to throw items away may hurt their health ."], "human": ["Hoarding is regarded as a disorder by psychologists .", "The mental health community has found effective treatments for hoarding .", "Symptoms of hoarding ca n ' t be easily noticed since it progresses quietly ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
