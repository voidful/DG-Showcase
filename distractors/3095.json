{"id": "3095", "article": "Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that he planned to give away almost all of his fortune , largely to the cause of global health , during the course of his lifetime . With an estimated worth of more than $ 40 billion , according to Forbes , the project will be no small fate for Gates . Having already provided the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with $ 24 billion to address global health issues , Gates said that finally his entire fortune will be put towards the cause except \" a few percent left for the kids \" . So what has made the richest man in the world to channel his resources so heavily into one interest ? Gates believes that \" the equality of opportunity \" in which Americans take such pride needs to extend to other nations around the world . Improving the health of the populations , he says , has proven to be an essential method in helping poor countries to be financially successful . \" National borders allow inequalities , \" said Gates . \" We all need to take a more global view , rather than just saying my country is doing well . We have to step up these health issues , knowing how few resources are going into them . \" Gates said that both his parents set up an example for him as a child . His father , William H . Gates , was the head of the local Planned Parenthood , and his mother , Mary , volunteered for the United Way . As he gathered his fortune , Gates knew he would finally want to give back as well , but he did n ' t expect to devote himself wholeheartedly to one project until he was about 60 . However , Gates , 47 , began to question his ability to wait that long . \" It seemed there was a real time urgency , \" Gates said . \" I started to think how many lives I could save before then . \"", "questions": "Bill Gates will give away his vast fortune to", "options": {"model": ["help the poor countries to be successful", "improve the health of population all over the world"], "human": ["improve the health of population in America alone", "improve the health of population all over the world"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
