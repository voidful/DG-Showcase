By the end of April 2009 , a primary school student has to run 120kms in total / A middle school students have to run 240kms by that time . Since the campaign started , people have had different ideas about it . Some people think it is good for students . They think the campaign can make students healthier . Some students have little exercise and the campaign can make them run . But some people do n ' t think so . They think some schools do n ' t have enough place for students to do running . If students have to run on the road , maybe it is not safe . They also think there are many ways to become healthier ; running is not the only way . So they think the campaign is not a right decision .", "questions": "Why do n ' t some people think the campaign is good ?", "options": {"model": ["because they think there are other ways to keep healthy besides worrying about the safe problem .", "because they think the campaign is n ' t a right decision .", "because they do n ' t think it is good for their health .", "because they think it is good for students ."], "human": ["Because they do n ' t think it ' s safe enough for a student to run such a long way every day .", "Because they do n ' t think it ' s safe to make so many students run together every day .", "Because they think students are busy with their school work and have no time to run .", "Because they think there are other ways to keep healthy besides worrying about the safe problem ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
