{"id": "4988", "article": "This sad story happened on a cold winter evening . It was so cold and snow was falling so heavily that the roads were covered with ice and a strong wind was blowing . Being outside in such weather was very unwise . However , Peter Lee had to walk home from work . Peter walked with difficulty along a country road , the cold wind beating against his chest . He thought , \" If I wear my coat backwards , maybe , it will be a little bit warmer for me . \" He stopped walking , took off his coat , and put it on backwards . \" That ' s much better , \" he said to himself happily . Walking on through the thickly falling snow , he was thinking about drinking a cup of warm coffee by the burning fireplace . A few minutes later , a car knocked down Peter . The driver had n ' t seen him soon enough . When he tried his best to put on the brakes , the car skidded on the icy road . The frightened driver got out of the car and ran to see how the poor man was . After a while , a police car arrived . A policeman went up to see Mr Lee who was lying on the ground . He told the driver , \" I ' m afraid he ' s dead . \" The driver was so surprised . \" This ca n ' t be the case , because I hardly touched him . Check my car carefully . There ' s not a mark on it . \" The policeman said , \" I ' m sure he ' s dead . \" \" It ' s impossible , \" the driver said anxiously . \" As soon as I hit him , I ran to help him . He was lying on the road , but he was breathing and there was no blood . \" \" Did you touch him ? \" the policeman asked . \" Yes , but only to turn his head around the right way , \" the driver answered .", "questions": "Peter Lee wore his coat backwards", "options": {"model": ["to keep himself a little bit warmer", "to make the driver cold", "to keep his car warm in winter"], "human": ["to help walk forward more easily", "not to let the cold wind blow", "to keep himself a little bit warmer"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
