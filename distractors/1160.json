{"id": "1160", "article": "There are many theories about how drama came into being in ancient Greece . The one most widely accepted today is based on the assumption that drama developed gradually from ceremonies . The argument for this view goes as follows . In the beginning , human beings viewed the natural forces of the world as unpredictable , and they sought through various means to control these unknown powers . Those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then kept and repeated until they hardened into fixed ceremonies . Eventually stories arose which explained the mysteries of the ceremonies . As time passed , some of them were abandoned , but the stories , later called myths , provided materials for art and drama Those who believe that drama came out of ceremonies also argue that those ceremonies contained the seed of theater because music , dance , and masks were almost always used . In addition , there were performers , and , since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in the rules of ceremonies , religious leaders usually assumed that task . Wearing masks , they often impersonated other people , animals , or supernatural beings , and performed the desired effect by gestures - - success in hunt or battle , the coming rain , the revival of the Sun - - as an actor might . Eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities . Another theory finds out the theater came from the human Interest in storytelling . According to this view , tales ( about the hunt , war , or other events ) are gradually formed , at first through the use of impersonation , action , and dialogue by a speaker and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person A closely related theory about drama _ those dances that are primarily rhythmical and gymnastic or that are imitations of animal movements and sounds .", "questions": "Which of the following is Not true according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the drama started by human beings was based on the purpose of the drama .", "religious activities developed gradually from ceremonies .", "wearing masks helps to control the natural force of the world .", "it took a long time for religious activities to be performed ."], "human": ["Three theories about how drama came into being are mentioned .", "The majority of people believe drama came from ceremonies .", "Stories were made up to explain the mysteries of the ceremonies .", "Religious activities developed gradually from ceremonies ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
