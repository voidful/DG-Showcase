{"id": "955", "article": "Making friends is a skill like most skills . It improves with practice . If you want to meet people and make friends , you must be willing to take some action . You must first go where there are people . You wo n ' t make friends staying home alone . Joining a club or a group , talking with those who like the same things as you do is much easier . Or join someone in some activity . Many people are nervous when talking to new people . After all meeting strangers means facing the unknown . And it ' s human nature to feel a bit uncomfortable about unknown . Most of our fears about dealing with new people comes from doubts about ourselves . We imagine other people are judging us , finding us too tall or too short , too this or too that . But do n ' t forget that they must be feeling the same way . Try to accept yourself as you are , and try to put the other person at ease . You ' ll both feel more comfortable . Try to act self - confident even if you do n ' t feel that way . When you enter a room full of strangers , such as a new classroom , walk tall and straight , look directly at other people and smile . If you see someone you ' d like to speak to , say something . Do n ' t wait for the other person to start a conversation .
