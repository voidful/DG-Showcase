{"id": "1220", "article": "My parents are amazing . I had the most wonderful childhood , and it ' s not because I had everything I wanted or because I was a cool kid . I have learned a lot about parenting from what my parents did . Here are a few gems that I use now or plan to use in the future with my two boys . Here ' s how a conversation often went when I was a kid . Usually it was around 4 : 30 p . m . I said , \" I ' m hungry . Can I have a cookie ? \" My mom answered , \" No . Have a banana . \" \" I do n ' t want a banana . \" \" Then you ' re not hungry . \" Sometimes I was angry about it , but I knew that was good for me . Thanks mom for not letting me eat junk food . Now I agree with my mother and I have this same conversation with my three - year - old son . I hope it helps him form healthy diet habits . I know many of us heard this as children . \" If everyone jumped off a bridge , would you do it , too ? \" If our kids asked for something just because everyone else had it or was doing it , we often got this response . It was the perfect response , and we soon learned not to ask for things because everyone else had it , but because it was something we wanted . I will always be thankful that my parents let us try the things that interested us , not the things they wanted to push us into . This helped me try swimming , dance , and the piano before second grade . I found a love - - singing - - and kept up with that through my college years . It drives me crazy , as a mom and teacher , when I see kids who are pushed into their parents ' favorite activities , even when they do n ' t have a passion for them .", "questions": "What are the gems in the writer ' s mind ?", "options": {"model": ["her parents ' good habits .", "her parents ' educational methods ."], "human": ["Her parents ' love .", "Her parents ' educational methods ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
