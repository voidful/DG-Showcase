And I liked the stories behind them , which made me forget all other things . McDonald ' s , Apple , Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well , and they are among my favorites .

The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve , in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge . One year later , the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne , and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree . This logo did n ' t stay long .
