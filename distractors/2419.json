{"id": "2419", "article": "You ' ve see news reports about people who need help after a natural disaster or animals in need . Or perhaps you ' ve watched TV programs about how lonely older people can get . So what can you do about any of those things ? The answer : You can volunteer . Volunteering gives you an opportunity to change people ' s lives , including your own . Helping others in need is such an important part of the American way of life that many high schools require their students to spend a certain number of hours volunteering in order to graduate . Volunteering is n ' t like school : Instead of having the choices made for you about where to go and what subjects to learn , you can choose what really interests you and who ( or what ) is most deserving of your time . If you like animals , help out at a local animal shelter . Most shelters depend on volunteers to keep the cats and dogs happy and well exercised . If you have a friend or who has or had a medical problem ( like cancer , HIV , for example ) , you might be inspired to donate your time to help an organization that raises money for research , delivers meals , or offers other help to people with the illness . If you like children , there are lots of volunteering opportunities - - from being a Big Brother or Big Sister to helping out in an after - school sports program . You also can : serve food at a homeless shelter ; take part in a park cleanup day . And if you have more than one thing you love , you can combine the two . For example , if you love kids and are great at arts and crafts , visit your local children ' s hospital and offer to lead art activities for young patients .", "questions": "If you want to finish your high school in America , you ' re required to", "options": {"model": ["be a volunteer", "be able to be a volunteer", "volunteer for some time"], "human": ["help your classmates", "spend a certain number of hours caring for animals", "volunteer for some time"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
