{"id": "1067", "article": "I have had the privilege of meeting some very interesting people over the years . Some of these people made a great impact on my life , my views and personal philosophy . Others I met had the opposite effect because they represented attitudes , behavior and beliefs that were directly opposed to my views on life and my feelings about the value of all people . One such person I met was a woman in her late seventies . She had been an active woman , raised a family and had engaged in helping others , and developed her own crafts to sell at selected craft shows throughout the year . When I met her for the first time , I could n ' t believe that she was in her late seventies - - I would have placed her age more in her early sixties . After speaking with her for a short period , it was only then that the conversation seemed to turn to age . And , it was n ' t a conversation about thefrailty of age , or the aches and pains , or about pleasures lost . The conversation , instead , focused on her _ for life and all the things that she was in the planning stages of doing . And , what she was planning to do was n ' t about going to a seniors group so she and her husband could go on a bus tour . What she was planning was an excursion to Europe , unaccompanied by any tour operator or taken around the usual sights by a local guide . She really impressed me a lot because of her zest for life ; for an uncompromising view of the future not in the least affected by her age ; for the undying faith in knowing that there was a great deal of life yet to be discovered and experienced and yearning for each new image , discussion , smell , cultural uniqueness or experience .", "questions": "From the text we know", "options": {"model": ["the woman did n ' t think her husband was a warm - hearted man .", "the woman ' s job was very important .", "the woman was willing to help others ."], "human": ["the woman made great wealth by selling crafts .", "the woman talked a lot about her age .", "the woman was willing to help others ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
