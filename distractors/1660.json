{"id": "1660", "article": "The other day I heard a few local musicians talking : \" I hate all the terrible pianos in this town . I hate that rubbish they play on the radio . They ca n ' t even understand a bit of music . \" \" I ' m never playing in that club again . Too many drunks and nobody listens to us . \" But a younger musician said , \" There are a few clubs that book my band a few nights a month , and I ' m trying to find other places to play . I ' m also looking to book a few summer festivals this year . \" I ' ve heard that you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with , or to put it another way , you are who your friends are . Attitudes are important . Whether they are positive or negative , they are _ . If you are around people who complain about lack of work and about other musicians , or blame others , and you play the role of victim , chances are you will start as well . So it ' s time to take a look at the people you call \" friends \" . This is an easy exercise : make a list of the people who you hand out with , and simply stop spending time with the negative people on your list . Set a new standard for yourself and do n ' t become friends with people who fall below that standard . Keep successful people around you and your own chances for success will be much better . Ask them how they do it . Ask if they will help you get the work you ' re looking for , or maybe give you some advice to help you on your career path . \"", "questions": "Which of the following would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["a friend is a friend indeed", "you are who your friends are", "a friend of your friends"], "human": ["A friend in need is a friend indeed", "Friends are the most important in one ' s success", "You are who your friends are"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
