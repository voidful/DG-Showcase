{"id": "1641", "article": "I have a friend named Monty Roberts . He has let me use his horse ranch to put on events to raise money for youth at risk programs . Last time I was there he introduced me by saying , \" I want to tell you why I let you use my house . It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer . When he was a senior , he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be when he grew up . \" \" That night he wrote a seven - page paper describing his goal of owning a horse ranch someday . He put all his heart into the project and wrote about his dream in great detail . He even drew a diagram of a 200 - acre ranch , showing the location of the buildings , stables and the track , and even a detailed floor plan for a 4000 - square - foot house on it . \" \" The next day he handed it in to his teacher . Two days later , he received a large red \" F \" on his paper with a note , ' See me after class . ' The boy went to see the teacher and asked why . The teacher told him there was no way for a young boy like him to do that because owning a horse ranch required much money and resources , and then added ' If you ' ll rewrite his paper with a more realistic goal , I will reconsider your grade . ' \" \" The boy went home and thought about it long and hard . He asked his father what to do . His father said , ' Look , son , you have to make up your own mind on this . However , I think it ' s a very important decision for you . ' \" \" Finally , a week later , the boy turned in the same paper without any change and stated , ' You can keep the F and I ' ll keep my dream . ' \" \" I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4000 - square - foot house in the middle of my 200 - acre horse ranch . I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace . \" Do n ' t let anyone steal your dreams . Follow your heart , no matter what .", "questions": "The author wrote this passage mainly to", "options": {"model": ["encourage people to stick to their dreams", "tell people how to make up their own mind", "tell people how to keep their own dream"], "human": ["tell people how to describe their goals", "teach people how to write their papers", "encourage people to stick to their dreams"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
