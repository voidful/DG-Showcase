{"id": "3262", "article": "Trees are useful to man in three important ways : They provide him with wood and other products ; they provide him shade ; . and they help to prevent droughts and floods . Unfortunately , in many parts of the world , man has not realized that the third of these services is the most important . In his eagerness to make money from trees , he has cut them down in large numbers , only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had . And besides , he is usually too careless to plant and look after new trees . So the forests slowly disappear . This does not only mean that man will have fewer trees . The results are even more serious : for where there are trees , their roots break up soil allowing the rain to sink in and also bind the soil , thus preventing it from being washed away easily ; but where there are no trees , the rain falls on hard ground and flows away , causing floods and carrying away the rich top - soil . When the top - soil is gone , nothing remains but worthless desert . Two thousand years ago , a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships , with which to gain itself an empire . It set up the empire , but , without its trees , its soil became poor and grew weak . When the empire fell to pieces , the home country found itself faced by floods and starvation .", "questions": "Which title best fits the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["trees and trees", "trees and man", "trees and rain"], "human": ["How Trees Prevent Droughts and Floods", "How an Empire Fell", "Trees and Man"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
