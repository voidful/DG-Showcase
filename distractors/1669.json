{"id": "1669", "article": "Bears and humans often meet in National Parks . Although campers and hikers are warned not to feed the bears , many people ignore these warnings and feed the beasts anyway . When bears are used to people ' s food , problems soon arise . Bears like to eat a large variety of things , both meat and vegetable . Without human assistance , bears live nicely on roots , twigs , leaves of trees , insects and small animals . With people around , the bears ' tastes quickly expand to include sandwiches , hot dogs , hamburgers , and anything else they can temp humans into giving up . Bears often develop clever strategies for getting people to let go their food supplies . More often than not , an unsuspecting hiker has taken off his or her pack for a rest only to have a bear charge out of the woods , grab the pack and quickly disappear into the underbrush with it . Hanging the pack on a tree branch wo n ' t help . Bears have been known to climb up , jump off , and catch the pack on the way down . One mother bear stretched up with her baby on her shoulders to reach a pack stored on a pole . Many bears threaten people into giving up their supplies . Although a bear is unlikely to attack a person and would probably run away if screamed at , few people are willing to do so . Most people drop the pack and run the other way . This , of course , delights the bear . In some places , the Park Service installed some metal barrels with lids to help campers keep their supplies safe from bears . Although the bears were unable to open these containers , the effort was less than successful . Most campers , unable to tell the metal drums from rubbish cans , never used them for the intended purpose .", "questions": "If people had never fed bears , the bears", "options": {"model": ["might be satisfied with what they had originally", "would not be able to get enough food from them"], "human": ["would n ' t have enough food supply", "might be satisfied with what they had originally"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
