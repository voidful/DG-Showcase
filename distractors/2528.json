{"id": "2528", "article": "Parents are anxious about their children ' s education and should be more detached to allow them to develop naturally , a leading headteacher , Peter Tait , says . Writing in Attain , the magazine of the Independent Association of Prep Schools , Mr Tait said : \" While parents are determined to do the very best for their child , they can end up doing the opposite . \" He said parents need to exercise \" common sense and parental nature \" when it comes to raising their children . He added : \" Parents also need to have confidence in those whose job it is to look after their children ' s education . To do this requires a certain detachment , a willingness to trust the passage of time , focusing on whether their children are happy , challenged and purposeful and are learning the right values . If so , they will be fine . \" However , he said , some parents are changing from \" sensible \" and \" moderate \" people , who have faith in their schools and teachers , and are \" turning into fighters ready to battle with anything and anyone on behalf of ' their ' child . \" What has made some parents put their own child at the centre of the universe and never to care about the rest ? \" And he also blamed the obsession over league tables for some parents ' anxiety . He said : \" League tables have caused too much anxiety for parents and have led to a boom in the number of tutoring agencies as parents feel they have no choice but to give their children a chance . \" Mr Tait acknowledged that being a parent has become increasingly difficult . He concluded : \" While teachers may occasionally feel discouraged by over - sensitive and demanding parents , they should note that this parenting lark is rather more difficult than it used to be . \"", "questions": "What ' s the main idea of the text ?", "options": {"model": ["parents should take their children ' s education .", "parents should allow children to develop naturally .", "parents should be aware of their children ' s needs ."], "human": ["Teachers may feel discouraged by demanding parents .", "Children should be put at the center of the universe .", "Parents should allow children to develop naturally ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
