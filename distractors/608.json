{"id": "608", "article": "In 490 B . C . the Greek messenger , Pheidippides , ran about 40 kilometers from the town of \" Marathon \" to Athens to announce the victory of Athens over Macedon . Since then , the 42 - kilometer \" Marathon \" race has become a great test for athletes . However , for many years , only men were allowed to run this race , because the distance was said to be unbearable for women . In 1966 , an American women named Roberta Gibb proved that idea wrong . Gibb had always enjoyed running . One day in 1964 , she saw the Boston Marathon happening as she was running in the woods . Since running meant a lot to her , she began training harder , hoping to join the marathon some day . Gibb finally applied to run in the 1966 Boston Marathon , but she was not given entrance because the Boston Marathon Association considered that women were not strong enough to run 42 kilometers . Yet , this was no obstacle to Gibb , for she knew she had the physical and mental strength to complete the race . On the day the 1966 Boston Marathon was held , Gibb hid in the bushes and jumped into the race when it began . She finished the race in 3 hours and 21 minutes , defeating two thirds of the men in the race and proving that women could run the marathon . Although what Gibb did was only to realize her dream , in doing so she showed the world that women could accomplish greater things than many people believed they could .", "questions": "What happened to Gibb in the 1966 Boston Marathon ?", "options": {"model": ["her application was n ' t accepted .", "she won the marathon race ."], "human": ["She was welcome to run the race .", "Her application was n ' t accepted ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
