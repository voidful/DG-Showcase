{"id": "3023", "article": "For the last 10 years , job listing site CareerBuilder has put out a list called \" The Most Unbelievable Excuses for Calling in Sick . \" For example , an employee said he could n ' t come in because his false teeth flew out the window while he was driving down the highway . The excuses were gathered through a survey that ran among 3 , 000 workers and 2 , 000 hiring managers . The list is entertaining but there is a more serious issue hidden in this story . Federal law does not require private employers to give any paid sick leave , making the US the only one of the world ' s wealthiest nations that doesn ' tguarantee workers this right . Since 2006 , cities and states have been adopting their own paid sick leave laws . California , Washington . DC and 13 cities including New York now require many employers to provide some sort of paid sick leave . But according to the Institute for Women ' s Policy Research , 39 % of private employees still have no access to paid days off . In the CareerBuilder survey , 38 % of respondents said they go to work when they ' re sick because they ca n ' t afford to miss a day ' s pay . The survey also shows that workers are taking a risk when they come up with _ excuses . Nearly one in five employers says they have fired an employee for calling in sick with a fake excuse . If you ' re spending the day at the beach while pretending to be ill , do n ' t post about it on Facebook . Nearly one in four employers ( 24 % ) has caught an employee lying about being sick by checking social media . The motto of this story : If you really are sick , do n ' t come to work and spread your bacteria around the office . But if you just want to stay home , go with \" I ' m running a fever . \" rather than one of these ridiculous excuses .", "questions": "What problem is exposed in the survey ?", "options": {"model": ["most of the employees ca n ' t get a paid leave .", "many employees have no access to paid sick leave .", "employees do n ' t have access to pay sick leave ."], "human": ["Private employers make their workers work extra hours .", "Private employers sometimes break the Federal law .", "Many employees have no access to paid sick leave ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
