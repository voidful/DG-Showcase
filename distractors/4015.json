{"id": "4015", "article": "Focus on class SOME US parents are sad that their high school children score badly in math , science and reading compared to kids in other countries . There has been an endless series of mostly fruitless education reforms to address this gap ( ) . Now comes an approach based on the insights of a group of US exchange students . They spent a year in some of the most successful high schools in the world - in Finland , Poland and South Korea . Author and journalist Amanda Ripley followed three exchange students for her new book , The Smartest Kids in the World - and How They Got That Way . She argues that to improve academics , US schools should de - emphasize sports . Instead , students should bring their passion and intensity to academics , she concludes . \" High school in Finland , Korea and Poland had a purpose , just like high school football practice in America , \" she writes . \" There was a big , important contest at the end , and the score counted . \" Sports are a distraction , Ripley argues , and most countries require them to take place outside of school . Trading in US school sports culture would be a huge change for people in the US , who respect teamwork and sportsmanship as training for life . But playing down sports could pay off , as it has elsewhere , if we redirect money , focus and glory to learning . Ripley is critical of memorization in South Korean education , but she praises the system ' s high goals and the free - dom its students have to fail and recover through hard work . Too often , we do n ' t ask teachers to give our kids harder assignments - and we ' re quick to complain about a failing grade . What ' s working elsewhere is to set ambitious goals for kids , and then allow them to discover that they have it within themselves to reclaim success from failure . Each of the countries in Smartest Kids came to education reform after an economic crisis . Finland was losing jobs after graduating just 10 percent of its teens from high school in the 1950s . Today , the graduation rate is 95 percent .
