{"id": "3718", "article": "Question : I have a one - year - old female bulldog , who has recently taken to biting my shoes when we are in the park and I ' m on the mobile . She can be slightly aggressive and I ' m starting to get worried and a bit annoyed . How do I stop her ? - - - - Susan , London . Answer : You need to get this problem under control before it could escalate . I always advise owners not to talk on the mobile phone when they go for a walk with their dogs , because they should be focusing on this time with their pets , but I know people have busy lives and need to make phone calls . The behavior she is showing is either controlling or playfulness , but they both result from the same issue - - - - you are not paying attention to her . If you must make phone calls while on a walk , try to still engage with your dog by speaking towards her , playing some sorts of game and so on . If that does n ' t work , you ' ll have to try more of a training approach . You will need a training line and some treats . Start your walk in the usual way , make a phone call , and when your dog starts displaying the undesired behavior , simply stop walking - - - otherwise she will see it as a game . When she is calm and looking at you , or if she sits , give her a treat ; then continue walking . If she starts up again , pick up the lead , gently pull it , and tell her \" no \" . Then ask her to sit and give her a treat if she does . The aim of this is to try to get her to forget how much fun it is biting your shoes . Do little sessions every day - - - and try not to answer the phone if you know it ' s going to be a long conversation . Be patient and good luck ! Remember that if an animal shows signs of distress or discomfort , an early visit to the vet is always recommended .", "questions": "The probable reason why the pet dog bites its owner ' s shoes is that", "options": {"model": ["the owner is n ' t paying attention to her", "it is n ' t necessary to talk on the phone"], "human": ["the owner does n ' t like the pet dog any more", "the owner is n ' t paying attention to her"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
