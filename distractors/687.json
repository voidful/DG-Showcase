{"id": "687", "article": "WASHINGTON - - Two - thirds of the world ' s polar bear population could be gone by 2050 if predictions of melting sea ice hold true , the US Geological Survey reported on Friday . The fate of polar bears could be even worse than that estimate , because sea ice in the Arctic might be disappearing faster than the available computer models predict , the geological survey said in a report aimed at determining whether the big white bear should be listed as a threatened species . \" There is a definite link between changes in the sea ice and the welfare of polar bears , \" said Steve Amstrup , who led the research team . He says Arctic sea ice is already at the lowest this year and is expected to retreat farther this month . That means that polar bears - - some 16 , 000 of them - - will disappear by 2050 from parts of the Arctic where sea ice is melting most rapidly , along the north coasts of Alaska and Russia , researchers said in a telephone briefing . Other polar bears could survive beyond that date but many of those could be gone by 2100 , Amstrup said . By this century ' s end , the only polar bears left might live in the Canadian Arctic islands and along the west coast of Greenland . \" It is likely to result in loss of approximately two - thirds of the world ' s current polar bear population by the mid 21st century , \" the report ' s executive summary said . \" Because the observed trajectory of Arctic sea ice decline appears to be underestimated by currently available models , this assessment of future polar bear status may be conservative . \" In January , the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species , noting polar bears depend on sea ice as a platform to hunt seals , their main food . Without enough sea ice , polar bears would be forced onto land , but they are poor hunters once they get out of the water and ice , the researchers said . The bears ' disappearance would probably take place as young cubs failed to survive to adulthood and females were unable to reproduce successfully .", "questions": "What causes the polar bears to disappear by 2050 ?", "options": {"model": ["the sea ice melting at high speed", "the ice melting in the arctic"], "human": ["The pollution of the Arctic region .", "The sea ice melting at high speed"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
