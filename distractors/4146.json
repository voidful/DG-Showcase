Great people are remembered not because they were handsome or beautiful , but because they did not give up when their lives were difficult . They used every opportunity to change their lives and make the world better . One good example is Orville and Wilbur Wright , the two brothers who invented the airplane . The plane has made the world into a small village . Hard work , not good luck , is the reason why the Wright Brothers could invent this convenient machine and become remarkable people .
