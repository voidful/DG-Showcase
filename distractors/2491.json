{"id": "2491", "article": "I had applied for the nuclear submarine program , and Admiral Rickover was interviewing me for the job . It was the first time I met Admiral Rickover , and we sat in a large room by ourselves for more than two hours , and he let me choose any subjects I wished to discuss . Very carefully , I chose those about which I knew most at the time - recent events , seamanship , music , literature , naval tactics , electronics , gunnery - and he began to ask me a lot of questions that were more difficult . Every time after my answers , he soon showed that I knew rather little about the subjects I had chosen . He always looked right into my eyes , and he never smiled . I was _ with cold sweat . Finally , he asked me a question and I thought it was my turn to show myself off . He said , \" How did you stand in your class at Georgia Tech before entering Annapolis as a first year student ? \" I had done very well , and I threw my chest with pride and answered , \" Sir , I stood thirty - ninth in a class of 820 ! \" I sat back to wait for the congratulations - which never came . Instead , the question : \" Did you do your best ? \" I started to say , \" Yes , sir , \" but I remembered who this was , and thought of several of my times at the Academy when I could have learned more about our allies , our enemies , weapons strategy and so on , so I finally said , \" No , Sir , I did n ' t always do my best . \" He looked at me for a long time , and then turned his chair around to end the interview . He asked one final question , which I have never been able to forget - or to answer . He said , \" Why not ? \" I sat there for a while , shaken , and then slowly left the room .", "questions": "When the author said : \" Sir , I stood thirty - ninth in a class of 820 !
