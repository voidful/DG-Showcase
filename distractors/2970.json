Like thousands of others , she is now living in a tent in the hard - hitting city of Mianyang . We are now sleeping in a tent city . The earthquake happened last Monday and our rooms in school were destroyed . There are four tent cities . Everybody is sleeping under tents . The tents are so wet and we feel so cold . Many students feel uncomfortable but we must live in the tent . Although there are many difficulties after the earthquake , we will do our best to solve them . Yesterday it rained all day . Today the weather is better . There are no dining halls and supermarkets , so we must cook for ourselves . We have got some food and vegetables to eat . After the earthquake , many students and I together cleaned all the rubble from our classroom and our dorms . Many of the rooms were destroyed and there was a lot of rubble which we had to clear . Some students are helping at hospital . Many people are homeless and many are dead . We carried the injured to hospital . There were no buses so we walked to hospital . Many people tried their best to make sure people could live . With the injured , we first let them calm down and then we took them to hospital . Today , I think people have enough food and drinking water . I think things will be better now .", "questions": "From the passage , we can learn that Xiang", "options": {"model": ["has saved many people", "has saved some food and vegetables for the students", "has joined in the rescue team"], "human": ["is sleeping under tents", "stays in a tent doing nothing", "has joined in the rescue team"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
