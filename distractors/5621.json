{"id": "5621", "article": "Engineers should embrace the arts , Sir John O ' Reilly , a fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology , argued in a lecture . About 59 % of engineering companies in the IET ' s 2014 survey feared skill shortages could threaten business . \" There is nothing as creative as engineering , \" Sir John told the reporter . He says science , technology , engineering and mathematics - often known as \" Stem \" subjects , are vital for a modern knowledge economy . But there is a massive shortfall in the number of recruits - with a recent study by the Royal Academy of Engineering saying the UK needs to increase by as much as 50 % the number of Stem graduates it produces . Delivering this year ' s Mountbatten Lecture at the Royal Institution , Sir John argued that engineers should recognise the role of the arts in their work - among other benefits ; this could attract more people into the profession . The lecture , Full Steam Ahead for Growth , advocated a wider adoption - - Steam , or science , technology , engineering , arts and maths . Engineers should embrace the arts as being key to creativity and an important component of innovation , crucial to creating new products and boosting future competitiveness , he argued . \" Engineering and technology is an increasingly diverse and creative field , \" said Sir John . Some university engineering departments already cooperated with art schools to develop understanding , he told the reporter . In particular he mentioned Cranfield University ' s Centre for Creative Competitive Design and Imperial College ' s work with the Royal College of Art . The two sets of people could work well together and more emphasis on the creative side of engineering could improve the success of products , he said . \" Aesthetics is part of it , \" he told the reporter , adding that Apple ' s iPod was not the first digital media player , nor the only one that worked - but it came to dominate the market \" because it was nice to have \" . Sir John said he was not suggesting universities started requiring A - level art from engineering applicants - the key subjects for admission would continue to be maths and the sciences .
