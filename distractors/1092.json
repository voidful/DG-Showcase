You will find that many Canadians will smile at you as they pass in the street , or say something to you like \" Hi ! \" or \" How ' s it going ? \" Just reply with something similar . In the UK the reply would be \" I ' m fine \" , but in Canada they say \" I ' m good \" . In company , when someone is offering you a second helping of food or more wine , if you do n ' t want any more , use the same expression - - \" I ' m good \" . In this case , it means \" No , thank you . I ' ve had enough \" . Most Canadians do n ' t press you to eat more than you want . In restaurant , your plate will be cleared away almost immediately you have finished eating . When you go into a shop or store , the shop assistant asks you how you are or if they can help you , it is their way of being friendly and making conversation with the customers . Canadians eat early and go home early . When you are invited to a Canadian ' s home , you may be asked to arrive at 5 : 30 pm or 6 pm . But guests in Europe do n ' t expect to arrive until 7 : 30 pm or 8 pm . Remember to take off your shoes and leave them inside the door without being asked . It ' s not a religious custom , but it ' s practical . In winter , there can be a lot of snow and dirt on your shoes , once you are in the warm house it melts and falls off , making a mess . Canadians tend to have light colored carpets or hardwood floors . If you ' re invited for dinner , it will be a full sit - down meal . Meat is usually barbecued in the freezing cold of winter . Do take something with you , like a bottle of wine .
