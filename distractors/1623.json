{"id": "1623", "article": "TUVALU , a tiny country in the Pacific Ocean , has asked for help as it will be swallowed up by the sea . Storms and huge waves are a constant threat and none of Tuvalu ' s nine little islands is more than five meters above sea level . Salt water is already entering the country ' s drinking water supply , as well as damaging plants that produce fruit and vegetables . Without urgent help , the country ' s days are numbered . But Tuvalu is not the first place to face sinking into the sea . Venice , a historic city in Italy best known for its canals , has sunk about 24 cm over the past 100 years . Experts say that it will have sunk another 20 - 50 cm by 2050 . A century ago , St . Mark ' s Square , the lowest point city , flooded about nine times a year . Nowadays , it happens more than 100 times . While Venice is slowly sinking into the mud on which it stands , global warming causes Tuvalu ' s rising sea level . The average global temperature has increased by almost 0 . 5 centigrade degrees over the past century ; scientists expect it rise by extra 1 - 3 degrees over the next 100 years . Warmer weather makes glaciers melt , and adds more water to the ocean . The warmer temperatures also make water expand , so it takes up more space , causing the sea level to rise . The sea level has risen about 10 - 25 cm in the last 100 years . The main cause of global warming is human pollution . Through burning coal , oil and gas , people have been increasing the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , such as CO2 . This adds to the power of the greenhouse effect , making the planet even warmer . Many scientists believe that , if the warming is not stopped , there will be huge climate changes . The sea level could rise by one meter this century . Should this come true , the sea would swallow up millions of homes and the world will be flooded with \" climate refugees \" looking for somewhere to live .", "questions": "Which of the following is False according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["tuvalu ' s nine little islands are more than five meters above the sea level .", "there will be huge climate changes in the sea level in the near future .", "the average global temperature has risen by 1 - 3 centigrade degrees over the past 100 years .", "there will be huge climate changes in the near future ."], "human": ["The sea level has risen about 10 - 25 cm in the last 100 years for warmer temperatures .", "The warmer temperature causes the sea level to rise .", "There will be huge climate changes unless the warming is stopped .", "The average global temperature has risen by 1 - 3 centigrade degrees over the past 100 years ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
