{"id": "3826", "article": "Concepts from science and nature are filled with our language ' s common phrases , idioms and spoken expressions . The unbelieving expression \" Well , I ' ll be a monkey ' s uncle \" has its origin in bitter disbelief over Darwin ' s writings on evolution . These colourful expressions bring spice to our language . Yet certain well - used phrases from science are just plain wrong ! Some are obvious , yet we use them anyhow . For example , a person who acutely shakes her head and says \" A watched pot never boils \" while you are waiting second after tiring second for test results to arrive or job offers to come in knows that if she sat down and watched a pot containing water on a stove over high heat for long enough , the water will eventually boil .

A blue moon is the term commonly used for a second full moon that occasionally appears in a single month of our solar - based calendars . The problem with the phrase , however , is that blue moons are not so rare . They happen every few years at least , and can even happen within months of each other when the 29 . 5 - day lunar cycle puts the full moon at the beginning of any month but February . The usage of \" blue moon \" as the second full moon in a month dates back to a 1937 Marine Farmer ' s Almanac . But before that , blue moons meant something slightly different . Typically , 12 full moons occur from winter solstice to the next winter solstice , but occasionally a fourth full moon in a season could be observed . In such a case , one of the four full moons in that season was known as \" blue \" Where there ' s smoke , there ' s fire : The phrase means that if something looks wrong , it likely is wrong . But let ' s step back . Do you always have to have fire if you see smoke ? Answering that first requires defining ' fire \" , Merriam - - Webster ' s first definition of fire is \" the phenomenon of combustion manifested in light , flame and heat \" . Combustion is the chemical reaction that occurs when fuel is burned in the presence of oxygen - - - denying a fire", "questions": "According to the passage , the blue moon", "options": {"model": ["has a history of about ten", "presents itself quite frequently sometimes"], "human": ["appears at the beginning of a month", "presents itself quite frequently sometimes"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
