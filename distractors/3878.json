{"id": "3878", "article": "There is some unwelcome news for students preparing for exams and officers putting in long hours - - - - - you do n ' t need the break as much as you may think that makes you feel less tired . Scientists have long assumed that willpower is a limited resource , which is why you feel the need to have a rest , have a snack and come back to a task when you ' re feeling better . They argued that the only way to restore willpower was by rest , food or entertainment . But psychologists have challenged this theory , saying weak willpower is all in your head . They found that people ' s beliefs in willpower determine how long and how well they ' ll be able to work on a tough mental exercise . \" If you think of willpower as something that ' s limited , you ' re more likely to be tired when you perform a difficult task , \" said Prof . Veronika Job . \" ' But if you think of willpower as something that is not easily used up , you can go on and on . \" The researchers designed four experiments to test students ' - beliefs in willpower . After a tiring task , those , who believed or were led to believe that willpower is a limited resource , performed worse on standard concentration tests than those who thought of willpower as something they had more control over . They also found that leading up to final exam week , students who believed the limited resource theory ate junk food 24 percent more often than those who believed they had more control in resisting temptation . Mr . Job said . \" The theory that willpower is a limited resource is interesting , but it has had unintended consequences . Students who may already have trouble studying are being told that their power of concentration is limited , and they need to take frequent breaks . But a belief in willpower as a non - limited resource makes people stronger in their ability to work through challenges . ' \" The findings could help people who are \" battling temptation . Willpower is n ' t driven by a biologically based process as much as we used to think . The belief in it is what influences your behavior .", "questions": "What have the scientists long believed regarding willpower ?", "options": {"model": ["it is a limited resource .", "it is the only way to change one ' s creativity ."], "human": ["There is no way to restore willpower .", "It is a limited resource ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
