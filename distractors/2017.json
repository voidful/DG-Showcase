{"id": "2017", "article": "Recently , one of my best friends , whom I ' d shared just about everything with since the first day of kindergarten , spent the weekend with me . Since I moved to a new town several years ago , we ' d both always looked forward to the few times a year when we could see each other . Over the weekend , we spent hours and hours , staying up late into the night , talking about the people she was hanging around with . She started telling me stories about her new boyfriend , about how she experimented with drugs and was into other bad habits . I was blown away ! She told me how she had been lying to her parents because they did n ' t want her around him . I tried to convince her that she was ruining her future and heading for big trouble . But she did n ' t believe me . Her self - respect seemed to have disappeared . I just could n ' t believe that she really thought it was acceptable to hang out with such a loser . By the time she left , I was really worried about her . It had been so discouraging , and I had come close to telling her several times during the weekend that maybe we had just grown too far apart to continue our friendship - - but I did n ' t . I put the power of friendship to the ultimate test . We ' d been friends for far too long . I had to hope that she valued me enough to know that I was trying to save her from hurting herself . I wanted to believe that our friendship could conquer anything . A few days later , she called to say that she had thought long and hard about our conversation , and then she told me that she had broken up with her boyfriend . I just listened on the other end of the phone with tears of joy running down my face . It was one of the truly rewarding moments in my life . Never had I been so proud of a friend .", "questions": "What ' s the author ' s purpose in telling the story ?", "options": {"model": ["to show the power of friendship .", "to show how to make friends with others .", "to tell his friends about his new boyfriend ."], "human": ["To tell the necessity of trusting friends .", "To tell the importance of keeping up with friends .", "To show the power of friendship ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
