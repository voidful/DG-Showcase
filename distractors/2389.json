{"id": "2389", "article": "Heather Jack and her family , including her two children , usually spend the Christmas holidays preparing a feast - - for others to eat . Last Christmas Eve , they went to a house in the neighborhood and prepared a dinner for an elderly woman and her son , who has muscular dystrophy . They stayed for an hour and chatted before heading home to prepare for a visit from Santa . \" I think it is that kind of direct experience that many find so meaningful , \" says Heather , president and founder of The Volunteer Family , a Boston - based organization dedicated to matching families with volunteer opportunities , both during the holidays and year - round . \" It ' s a great way for parents to involve the kids . \" In a holiday season that stretches from before Thanksgiving to just after the New Year , it ' s nice to hear stories about people with their children giving instead of receiving . Last December Gary and Debra Danoff and their two teenage sons drove to the Washington , D . C . Jewish Community Center ( JCC ) and spent Christmas morning in the Center ' s kitchen preparing a feast for homeless shelters . By choosing to prepare meals for the homeless , the Danoffs bring together a belief in community service with their love of cooking , \" It feels good to prepare food with our kids for other people at Christmas , \" says Gary . \" We want them to know that many people do n ' t have the ability to go to the supermarket and pick the foods they want to eat and pay for them . \" The Danoffs were in good company . Across the city , at least 1000 volunteers with their children went across the region to provide food to the poor people as part of the D . C . JCC ' s annual \" December 25th Day of Service \" , now in its 22nd year .", "questions": "The Heathers did all the following things except _ last Christmas Eve .", "options": {"model": ["visiting one of their good friends in other district", "eating and paying for their children"], "human": ["preparing a dinner for a poor family", "visiting one of their good friends in other district"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
