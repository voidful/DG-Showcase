{"id": "31", "article": "Do you drink water that ' s been left sitting out overnight or even for another day ? Have you noticed it tastes different ? Tap water that has been left to sit out slowly begins to acquire an off taste . Many people think that this is because of microorganisms . But that ' s not what makes old water taste not fresh . For that we can thank carbon dioxide . After about 12 hours , tap water starts to go flat as carbon dioxide in the air starts to mix with the water in the glass , lowering its pH and giving it an off taste . But it ' s most likely safe to drink . However , back to those microorganisms . If you use a dirty glass day after day , there is more of a chance of bacteria making themselves known ; a risk that increases if you share the glass with another mouth as well . But assuming you use a fresh glass every few days , you probably wo n ' t have a problem unless the glass has been touched by dirty fingers , and especially if those dirty fingers went unwashed after using the bathroom . As for plastic water bottles that have been left out in the sun or in the car , step away from the bottle , warns Dr . Kellogg Schwab , director of the Johns Hopkins University Water Institute . \" A chemical called bisphenol - A , or BPA , along with other things used to make plastic can leach into your water if the bottle heats up or sits in the sun , \" he explains . BPA , as you probably know , has been linked to everything from heart disease to cancer . Schwab also adds that plastic used for commercial bottled water is n ' t meant to be washed or refilled , so use only one time and recycle . Or do n ' t buy them at all ; use refillable water bottles instead .", "questions": "Tap water begin to acquire an off taste because of", "options": {"model": ["carbon dioxide", "the water"], "human": ["the glass", "carbon dioxide"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
