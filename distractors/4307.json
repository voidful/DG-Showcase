{"id": "4307", "article": "Each nation has many good people who help to take care of others . For example , some high school and college students in the United States often spend many hours as volunteers in hospitals , orphanages or homes for the old . They read books to the people in these places , or they just visit them and play games with them or listen to their problems . Other volunteers go and work in the homes of people who are sick or old . They paint , clean up , or repair their houses , do their shopping or mow their lawns . For boys who no longer have fathers there is an organization called Big Brothers . College students and other men take these boys to baseball games or on fishing trips and help them to get to know things that boys usually learn from their fathers . Each city has a number of clubs where boys and girls can go to play games or learn crafts . Some of these clubs show movies or organize short trips to the mountains , beaches , museums or other places of interest . Most of these clubs use a lot of high school and college students as volunteers because they are young enough to remember the problems of younger boys and girls . Volunteers believe that some of the happiest people in the world are those who help to bring happiness to others . ,", "questions": "Why do most of the boys ' and girls ' clubs use many high school and college students as volunteers ?", "options": {"model": ["because they are young enough to remember the problems of young boys and girls .", "because they are very young and they can remember many things ."], "human": ["Because they like younger boys and girls .", "Because they are very young and they can remember many things ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
