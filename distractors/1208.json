{"id": "1208", "article": "An unemployed man is desperate to support his family . His wife watches TV all day and his three teenage kids have dropped out of high school to hang around with the local toughs . He applies for a cleaner ' s job at a large firm and easily passes an aptitude test . The human resources manager tells him , \" You will be hired at minimum wage , $ 5 . 15 an hour . Let me have your e - mail address so that we can contact you easily . Our system will automatically e - mail you all the forms and advise you when to start and where to report on your first day . \" Greatly surprised , the man protests that he has neither a computer nor an e - mail address . To this , the manager replies , \" You must understand that to a company like ours that means you virtually do not exist . Without an e - mail address you can hardly expect to be employed by a high tech firm . Good day . \" Unable to believe what he heard , the man leaves . Not knowing where to turn and having $ 10 in his wallet , he walks past a farmers ' market and sees a stand selling beautiful tomatoes . He buys a crate , carries it to a busy corner and displays the tomatoes . In less than two hours he sells all the tomatoes and makes 100 % profit . From that day on , he repeats the tomato business and becomes increasingly successful as time goes on . By the end of the fifth year he owns a fleet of nice trucks and a warehouse . The tomato company has put hundreds of homeless and jobless people to work and the business grossed a million dollars . Planning for the future , he decides to buy some life insurance . The insurance adviser asks him for his e - mail address in order to send the final documents electronically . When the man replies that he does n ' t have time to mess with a computer and has no e - mail address , the insurance salesman is surprised , \" No computer ? No Internet ? Just think where you would be if you ' d had all of that five years ago ! \" \" Ha ! If I ' d had all of that five years ago , I would be sweeping floors at Microsoft and making $ 5 . 15 an hour ! \" the man replies .", "questions": "The man ' s tomatoes sell well because", "options": {"model": ["he has chosen the right place to sell them", "he has sold all his tomatoes to a company", "he wants to make more money"], "human": ["the tomatoes look very beautiful", "the tomatoes are contained in beautiful crates", "he has chosen the right place to sell them"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
