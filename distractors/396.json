{"id": "396", "article": "Twelve years ago , I arrived in Central Florida from Puerto Rico . I had heard of a job opportunity and decided to pursue it . But it never became a reality . I quickly learned that being alone without resources in an unfamiliar city was not a comfortable situation to be in . Once my limited funds ran out I became homeless and spent a year and a half living on the streets of Orlando . Apart from feeling not being noticed and missing my family , I had to face another challenge - - hunger . For the first time in my life , I , as a foreign man , who had lived my life in the relative comfort of the middle class , understood the desperation someone feels when they do n ' t get enough to eat . I clearly remembered having run a distance of more than 7 miles on many occasions just to make it to a local feeding program before they closed at 7 pm . Once the need for food was met , the next challenge would arise - - where to find a place to sleep for the night . Fortunately , local programs like the Coalition for the Homeless , Second Harvest Food Bank and the Wayne Densch Center were an important part of my ability to survive my painful experience . With the assistance of these programs , I was accepted by a college scholarship program through the Coalition and obtained two degrees from Valencia . My experience has helped me understand that devoting my life to helping others offers lasting rewards . Today , I am employed as Childhood Hunger Programs Manager at Second Harvest Food Bank and oversee the summer feeding , Hi - Five Kids Pack , and Kids Cafe programs . I am so proud to be able to distribute food resources to those wonderful programs and help hundreds more like me .", "questions": "Why did the author run a distance of over 7 miles on many occasions ?", "options": {"model": ["because he desired to get some food to eat .", "because he did n ' t have enough to eat ."], "human": ["Because he helped distribute food resources to the poor .", "Because he desired to get some food to eat ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
