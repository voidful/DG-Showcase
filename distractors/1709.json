{"id": "1709", "article": "If you are planning to study in the United States , you need to consider several factors . Everyone has different opinions about where is the best place to live in . Also , the best places to live in are not always home to the best schools . Finally , many schools specialize in different areas of study . The Massachusetts Institute of Technology , for example , is a great school for computer science and technology - related fields of study . However , if you want to study oceanography , your interests may be better served by attending school in a place that is on a coastline or near the ocean . Now I am sure that you know which schools are considered the best in the country . So I will tell you about which states I believe are the best to live in . California is a nice state . Northern California specifically has very good weather . Los Angeles in southern California is another story , though . Life in LA is full of excitement and fast , and sometimes dangerous . As for me , I enjoyed the time I spent in Massachusetts , Virginia and Maryland and these states have a lot of history and culture . The weather is not as perfect as Northern California , but it is still quite nice . My favorite area of America is the Mid - west . Middle America , I think , is home to the true American sense of values . In addition , there are many good universities there . Also , you need to think about your likes and dislikes and then research the various states . You like sunshine and hate snow ? Then you probably wo n ' t like the Midwest or even the Northeast . Open space , nature and peace ? Then you probably should stay away from America ' s large cities . Are you interested in government ? Then Washington D . C . is the only place for you . Whatever you decide , put some thought into it . The place you live in could be the difference between a great study - abroad experience and a state of great suffering on earth .", "questions": "What is California like ?", "options": {"model": ["california is a state with different climates .", "there are many good universities in the usa .", "california is a state with many kinds of climate .", "there are many good universities ."], "human": ["California is the best place to live in .", "California is the worst place to live in .", "California is a state with the largest city .", "California is a state with different climates ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
