{"id": "5313", "article": "People have been listening to music to get in the mood for hundreds of years . Recently , there is scientific research to _ what we have always known about music . The studies have shown that when people are excited or happy they are more helpful . The opposite happens when people feel aggressive or under stress . The use of music can influence how helpful people can be . Dr Adrian North made a study with 256 university students . Half the group took exercise in the gymnasium listening to music which can bring happiness and the other half exercised to aggressive music . When leaving the gym , the students were asked to hand out flyers in support of the local disabled athlete ' s foundation . The results showed that nearly half of the group that listened to happy music were willing to hand out flyers . But in the group that heard the aggressive music , less than 20 % were willing . This study suggests that our choice of music can influence our willingness to cooperate . While a study also shows that productivity can increase with the right choice of background music in the workplace . As music stimulates workers ' minds , job satisfaction is often positively influenced . Other studies have shown that workers who are in a good mood report more job satisfaction than those in a bad mood . These studies show that music can have a powerful influence on a person ' s ability to cooperate . Moods have a direct influence on cooperation and job satisfaction , etc . These factors also have a direct relationship to the success of a business .", "questions": "The passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["the relationship between music and mood", "music and mood"], "human": ["music and science", "music and mood"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
