About 30 , 000 runners , many from other parts of China or abroad , awoke in the Chinese capital on Sunday to an orange sun glowing weakly through a dirty haze . _ . But no one cancelled on the advice of the organizers , the Chinese Athletic Association and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sports , because those organizations did not call it off . That has made participants call the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) , which has approved the 26 - mile , or 42 - kilometer race , to set air quality standards in the future to avoid damaging the runners ' health .

Pope , who has lived in Beijing for 11 years and runs several long - distance races each year . \" It ' s meant to be fun and good for your health , \" Mr . Pope said of the marathon . \" But in such air , it ' s just ridiculous to be running , \" he said . He abandoned the course . \" Most of my overseas friends pulled out , \" he said . \" And quite a few of my Chinese friends too , but a lot did n ' t . I think they do n ' t know as much about the health impact . \" Images on Twitter and Chinese social media showed Chinese runners wearing a variety of face protections , from light cloth masks to World War I - style gas masks . Still many completed the race without masks . \" Today ' s race should definitely have been called off or rescheduled , \" said Zhang Kai , Beijing - based campaigner with Greenpeace East Asia . \" What happened today to this sports even is just another reminder to the government that much remains to be done to China ' s energy and industrial structure to solve pollution , \" said Mr . Zhang . \" If the battle against pollution is a marathon , it is now time to catch up on speed . \" In the end , the race was won by two Ethiopians : Girmay Birhanu Gebru won the men ' s race in 2 hours , 10 minutes and 42 seconds while Fatuma Sado Der", "questions": "Zhang Kai thinks the battle against pollution", "options": {"model": ["does n ' t like the race so", "is connected with china ' s unreasonable energy and industrial structure ."], "human": ["will remind all the Chinese to reduce pollution .", "is connected with China ' s unreasonable energy and industrial structure ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
