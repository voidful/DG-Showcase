{"id": "2009", "article": "A high school history teacher once told us , \" If you make one close friend in school , you will be most fortunate . A true friend is someone who stays with you for life . \" Experience teaches that he was right . Good friendships are just not easily formed . Why ? One reason is that it is easy to move around in our society . Mr . Darrell Sifford , a news reporter for the Washington Daily , has been studying and talking about friendships for a number of years . He reports what one woman thought about the effect of ease of movement on friendship : \" I was nine , and we ' d just moved from South Carolina to New Jersey , and I did n ' t know anybody . _ and she said to me , ' Amelia , I know you ' re feeling bad because you do n ' t have any friends . But you can fix that . Just walk across the street - - I know there ' s a girl about your age over there - - and knock on the door and ask her to be your friend . ' \" \" As a 9 - year - old , I could do that . I knocked on the door and said , ' Hi , my name is Amelia , and I ' d like for us to be friends . ' And to my surprise , she said that she would like that too - - and we became friends . \" She added that going about it directly always worked when she was a child . But as she left childhood , she found that the simple direct approach was more and more difficult for her to follow . So , as an adult , Amelia longed to have friends but her hands were tied when it came to doing anything about it . The problem , according to her , is that society teaches us in a number of ways that direct action is not an acceptable way of doing things . We need to be less direct so that our feelings will not be hurt if our offer of friendship is refused . Mr . Sifford goes on to describe his own ideas on the subject : \" To most of us , friendship is very important , but we need to have clear in our own minds the kinds of friendships we want . Are they to be very close or kept at arm ' s length ? Do we want to share ourselves or do we want to walk on the surface", "questions": "The main point we learn from the passage is", "options": {"model": ["it is not easy to make friends", "childhood friends are not easily formed in our society", "it is easy to move around in our society", "good friendships are not easily formed"], "human": ["willingness to experiment is the key to close friendship .", "openness to others is important in interpersonal relationships", "direct offers of friendship are not easily accepted", "good friendships are not easily formed"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
