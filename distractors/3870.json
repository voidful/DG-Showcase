{"id": "3870", "article": "It is 4 o ' clock in the early morning . Everything but the computing room on the campus of the university appears as quiet and misty as the mysterious hell . In the computing room , 30 students with sleepy eyes , sit still at their desk , beating the dirty and worn keys . Staring at the colorful screen , they tap continuously for hours . For the other parts in the world , it might be in the middle of the night , nevertheless here time represents nothing . It is an entirely enclosed field . These young computer \" hackers \" are tracing a sort of stimulus , a drive so exciting and absorbing that it ignores nearly anything else in their lives and becomes the focus of their being . They are addicted computer programmers . Some of these students have been glued to the console for no less than twenty hours even with no break for meals or rest . Some have been sleeping on sofas and chairs in the computing room , trying to struggle for a few moments ' rest but hating to get too far away from their addicted machines . It is not necessary for most of these students to be at the computing room in the middle of the night . What they are working belong to no assignments . They remain there because they desire to be - - they can not resist the attraction of the computers . Furthermore , they are in groups instead of being alone . There are hackers at computing rooms all over the country . In the unimaginable way , they focus on nothing but computer . They escape from schooling and live beyond friendship ; they might have difficulty being employed , choosing to travel from one computing room to another . They may even give up personal health . \" There is one hacker in my memory . We actually had to lift him away from his chair to feed him and arrange him to rest and sleep . We truly worried about his health , \" says a computing science professor at California University . Professors of computer science are nowadays paying more attention to this hacker phenomenon and are on the watch for future hackers and more and more severe computer addicts . They believe firmly that hackers are not simply resulted from the close relationship with a machine . It is the result of social relationship with the attractive thinking machines , which are becoming nearly universal .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that those at the computing room in the middle of the night are", "options": {"model": ["students who are tired of the computer", "students deeply fascinated by the computer", "students working in the computer field for too long"], "human": ["students using computers to amuse themselves", "hard - working computer science majors", "students deeply fascinated by the computer"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
