{"id": "3004", "article": "Arabs consider it extremely bad manners to start talking business immediately . Even the busiest government official always takes extra time to be polite and offer refreshments . No matter how busy you are , you should make time for this . The conference visit is a way of doing business throughout the Arab world . Frequently , you will have to discuss your business in the presence of strangers , who may or may not have anything to do with your business . Do not be surprised if your meeting is interrupted several times by people who come into the room unannounced , whisper , or speak softly to the person with whom you are talking , and leave . Act as though you do not hear , and never show displeasure at being interrupted . Making decisions quickly is not an Arab custom . There is a vagueness in doing business in the Middle East which will puzzle a newcomer . Give yourself lots of time and ask lots of questions . When an Arab says \" yes \" , he may mean \" maybe \" . When he says \" maybe \" , he probably means \" no \" . You will seldom get a direct \" no \" from an Arab because it is considered not polite . Instead of \" no \" , he will say \" inshallah \" , which means \" if God is willing \" . On the other hand , \" yes \" does not necessarily mean \" yes \" . A smile and a slow nod might be like an agreement but in fact your host is being polite . An Arab considers it rude to disagree with a guest .", "questions": "The main purpose of this article is to explain", "options": {"model": ["how to be polite when talking to a person in the arab world", "how to be polite when doing business in the arab world", "how to be polite when doing business", "what to do when you are talking to a person in the arab world"], "human": ["why you need extra time when you visit Arab countries", "why Arab officials are so busy", "what Arabs say when doing business", "how to be polite when doing business in the Arab world"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
