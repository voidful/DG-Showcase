In 1958 , a man named Godtfred created the plastic building bricks that can now be found in almost every child ' s toy box . The simple building block has become one of the most well - known and popular toys around the world . \" The Lego brick continues to be very attractive , because it allows children , and others , to develop their creativity and imagination , \" said Charlotte Simonsen , a spokeswoman of Lego . The company ' s building brick allows an endless number of links . With just two bricks there are 24 different links , and with six , there are 915 million possibilities , according to Lego . A half century after its creation , more than 400 million children and adults spend five billion hours a year putting the bricks together and pulling them apart . Also , the bricks made today can still link with those made in 1958 . Lego bricks are n ' t just child ' s play : they also attract the interest of adults . South Korean adventurer , Heo Young Ho , who climbed Mount Everest in 1987 , left a Lego toy behind in the snow during his climb . After its great success Lego experienced a serious crisis at the end of the 1990s , hit hard by competition from electronic games . Lego then suffered a dark period that lasted several years . With great efforts , the company began to be popular again , and in 2006 it earned about 1 . 5 billion dollars in 130 countries . Seven boxes of Lego are now sold every second around the world , and 19 billion bricks are produced each year : enough to encircle the Earth five times !", "questions": "The Lego bricks remained popular in the past 53 years because they", "options": {"model": ["attract the interest of adults in making the toys", "make the children worldwide develop their creativity and imagination", "attract the interest of adults in making the children learn from the lego", "can make the children go on playing with their adults"], "human": ["attract many children worldwide", "brought imagination to the children worldwide", "have endless links that bring many imagination", "make the children worldwide develop their creativity and imagination"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
