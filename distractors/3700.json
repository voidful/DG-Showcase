{"id": "3700", "article": "I have forgotten the name of an old lady who was a customer on my paper route when I was a twelve - year - old boy back in 1954 . Yet it seems like just yesterday that she taught me a lesson in forgiveness that I can only hope to pass on to someone else someday . On a Saturday afternoon , a friend and I were throwing rocks onto the roof of the old lady ' s house . I found a smooth rock and sent it . The stone headed straight for a small window on the old lady ' s back door . At the sound of broken glass , we took off from the old lady ' s yard . I was too scared about getting caught that first night . However , a few days later when I was sure that I had n ' t been discovered , I started to feel guilty for her misfortune . I decided to save my paper delivery money , and in three weeks I had the seven dollars that I thought would cover the cost of her window . I put the money in an envelope with a note explaining that I was sorry for breaking her window . Then I put the envelope through the letter slot in her door . My soul felt redeemed and I could n ' t wait for the freedom of , once again , looking straight into the old lady ' s eyes . The next day , I . handed the old lady her paper . She thanked me for the paper and said , \" Here , I have something for you . \" It was a bag of cookies . I thanked her and ate the cookies as I continued my route . After several cookies , I felt an envelope and pulled it out of the bag . When I opened the envelope , I was shocked . Inside was the seven dollars and a short note that said , \" I ' m proud of you . \"", "questions": "What did the author do to make up for his mistake ?", "options": {"model": ["he took away the old lady ' s window and took it away .", "he saved some money to cover the cost .", "he gave some money to the old lady .", "he put the money in an envelope with a note ."], "human": ["He gave the old lady papers for free .", "He apologized in the old lady ' s presence .", "He bought cookies for the old lady .", "He saved some money to cover the cost ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
