David lost his father when he was two years old and lived with his mother and grandfather ever since . But the year before he turned 13 , his grandfather died and his mother was killed in a car accident . His teacher told me that he refused to talk to others from then on . How could I help him ? David did n ' t say a word . As he was leaving , I put my hand on his shoulder . \" Come back next week if you like . \" I said . He came and I suggested we play a game of chess . He agreed . After that we played chess every Wednesday afternoon - - in complete silence . Usually , he arrived earlier than agreed . It seemed that he liked to be with me . But why did n ' t he ever look at me ? \" Perhaps he simply needs someone to share his pain with , \" I thought . Months later , when I was looking at his head , he suddenly looked up at me . \" It ' s your turn , \" he said . After that day , David started talking . He finally got friends in school and he even joined a bicycle club . He wrote to me a few times . Now he had re ally started to live his life . Maybe I gave David something .
