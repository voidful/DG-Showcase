{"id": "1247", "article": "When I was about 12 , I had an enemy , a girl who liked to point out my shortcomings . Week by week her list grew : I was very thin , I was n ' t a good student , I talked too much , I was too proud , and so on . I tried to hear all this as long as I could . At last , I became very angry . I ran to my father with tears in my eyes . He listened to me quietly , then he asked . \" Are the things she says true or not ? Janet , did n ' t you ever wonder what you ' re really like ? Well , you now have that girl ' s opinion . Go and make a list of everything she said and mark the points that are true . Pay no attention to the other things she said . \" I did as he told me . To my great surprise , I discovered that about half the things were true . Some of them I could n ' t change ( like being very thin ) , but a good number I could - - and suddenly I wanted to change . For the first time I go to fairly clear picture of myself . I brought the list back to Daddy . He refused to take it . \" That ' s just for you , \" he said . \" You know better than anyone else the truth about yourself . But you have to learn to listen , not just close your ears in anger and feeling hurt . When something said about you is true , you ' ll find it will be of help to you . Our world is full of people who think they know your duty . Do n ' t shut your ears . Listen to them all , but hear the truth and do what you know is the right thing to do . \" Daddy ' s advice has returned to me at many important moments . In my life , I ' ve never had a better piece of advice .", "questions": "Why did her father listen to her quietly ?", "options": {"model": ["because the writer did n ' t like the girl ' s words .", "because he thought her daughter ' s \" enemy \" said was true .", "because he believed that what her daughter ' s \" enemy \" said was mostly true ."], "human": ["Because he knew that his daughter would not listen to him at that moment .", "Because he was n ' t quite sure which girl was telling the truth .", "Because he believed that what her daughter ' s \" enemy \" said was mostly true ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
