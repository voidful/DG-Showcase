{"id": "108", "article": "Around twenty years ago I was going through hard times . I could not find a satisfying job . To my shame , I had to drive a school bus to make ends meet and lived in a friend ' s house . One afternoon , while driving through a quiet suburban neighborhood I was so sad that I kept asking myself \" Why has my life become so hard ? \" \" What ' s wrong with the world ? \" Then I pulled over the bus to drop off a little girl and as she passed she handed me a pretty earring , saying she found it on the floor of the bus and I should keep it in case the owner came to look for it . In the evening , the owner did come to look for her earring . When I handed it to her , she got very excited and continued saying \" Thanks , you ' re a real gentleman . \" I told her that she should thank the little girl who had found it . She said , \" Yes , and you are a good driver , too . What a lovely world it is ! \" Then she left with satisfaction . I was touched by her last words . I had thought something was wrong with the world just because of my poor condition . In fact , nothing was wrong with the world . I should change my attitude towards life . I should be positive about life . At first it was hard , and then it got easier . Every day I could find things to make me happy . Then one night there was a phone call for me at my friend ' s house from a lady who was a manager in a large hospital . She said she had read my application form and asked me if I would like to work in the hospital . I said yes and got the job . Looking back at the experience I know the most important is to have a positive attitude towards life .", "questions": "What does the author want to show in this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["one should hold a positive attitude towards life .", "a friend in need is a friend indeed .", "it ' s right to have a positive attitude toward life ."], "human": ["Life is usually hard for the young at the beginning .", "It is not easy to find a good job nowadays .", "One should hold a positive attitude towards life ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
