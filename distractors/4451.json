{"id": "4451", "article": "Have you ever wondered what goes through your mind when you choose where to sit in a new classroom ? Or in a waiting room full of strangers ? Or on a bus ? Researchers have found out some interesting facts . Perhaps unsurprisingly , we prefer to sit closer to people like ourselves . Girls sit by girls and boys sit by boys . Adults sit together and young people choose another young person to sit near . But it goes further than this . We even choose to sit near someone who looks like us . People with glasses are more likely to sit near other people with glasses . People with long hair sit closer to other people with long hair . We seem to believe that people with similar habits or hobbies will share similar attitude and we are more likely to be accepted by people like ourselves or even , we think we may be safer with people who look like us . Sometimes that ' s true but it ' s a pity if we always stick to the same people , the same group . The danger in always staying in our comfort zone is that we just recycle the same opinions , the same tastes and the same ideas . We lose the chance to learn something new , find out about interesting things , hear funny stories and discover difference . When we always stick to the same people , how can we ever break down the barriers which prevent us from getting to know people with different ideas ? And how can we avoid the ignorance , which too often leads to prejudice and even fear ? If instead you want to live in a society that opens to changes and new things and different opinions , be the cat among the pigeons . Move out of your comfort zone . Go and sit next to someone different . And do n ' t just sit there in silence . Say hello . Ask a question . Start a conversation . That ' s how we make friends . That ' s how we learn about people . That ' s how we open our minds to new ideas . That ' s how we live an exciting life .", "questions": "People like staying in their comfort zone because they may", "options": {"model": ["get along better with other people", "be accepted easily and feel safe"], "human": ["find out more interesting things", "be accepted easily and feel safe"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
