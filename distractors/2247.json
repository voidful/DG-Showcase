{"id": "2247", "article": "Computers have beaten human world champions at chess and , earlier this year , the board game Go . So far , though , they have struggled at the card table . So we challenged one AI to a game . Why is poker so difficult ? Chess and Go are \" information complete \" games where all players can see all the relevant information . In poker , other players ' cards are hidden , making it an \" information incomplete \" game . Players have to guess opponents ' hands from their actions - - tricky for computers . Poker has become a new benchmark for AI research . Solving poker could lead to many breakthroughs , from cyber security to driverless cars . Scientists believe it is only a matter of time before AI once again _ humans , hence our human - machine match comes up in a game of Texas Hold ' s Em Limit Poker . The AI was developed by Johannes Heinrich , researcher studying machine learning at UCL . It combines two techniques : neural networks and reinforcement learning . Neural networks , to some degree , copy the structure of human brains : their processors are highly interconnected and work at the same time to solve problems . They are good at spotting patterns in huge amounts of data . Reinforcement learning is when a machine , given a task , carries it out , learning from mistakes it makes . In this case , it means playing poker against itself billions of times to get better . Mr Heinrich told Sky News : \" Today we are presenting a new procedure that has learned in a different way , more similar to how humans learn . In particular , it is able to learn abstract patterns , represented by its neural network , which allow it to deal with new and unseen situations . \" After two hours of quite defensive play , from the computer at least , we called it a draw .", "questions": "Why ca n ' t the computer beat humans at the poker game ?", "options": {"model": ["because the computer ca n ' t tell any information to the players .", "because the computer does n ' t know the other player ' s cards .", "because the computer does n ' t have the ability to play with the other players .", "because the computer ca n ' t know the other players ' cards completely ."], "human": ["Because humans are cleverer than the computer .", "Because humans practice playing the poker game every day .", "Because the computer ca n ' t learn the regular rules of the poker game .", "Because the computer ca n ' t know the other players ' cards completely ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
