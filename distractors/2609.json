But the \" chalk and talk \" method helped them achieve better exam results . Modern classroom techniques may make school days a good deal happier , but contentment is not the road to success in examinations , according to university researchers . Their three - year study , monitoring the progress of 2000 teenagers , tried to measure the influence of the \" boredom factor \" in 17 selected schools in the north of England . The researchers also found that the old - fashioned approach of teachers ordering pupils about is still alive and producing results . Their conclusions were welcomed yesterday by educationists who were worried by the shift to less formal lessons . The pupils in the latest study were asked to award teachers marks to measure how frequently they followed or ignored today ' s fashion for \" child - centred \" education . A five - point scale was given to spot the teachers who always told them what they should know and what to write down . \" It was significant and not anything you would get by chance or accident . Certainly , when you compare the pupil ' s interest and attitude to school , there is a quite definite and highly significant difference , \" one of the researchers said . But the rankings were turned upside down when the team of four researchers looked at how the children did in examination . The sort of methods now frowned upon actually improve the final grades . The researchers said , \" There is nothing wrong with old - fashioned , didactic teaching in the fight place , even if it is n ' t the flavor at the moment . \" However , he insisted the best teachers had always mixed the two techniques to match the needs of pupils , although certain examinations forced some to concentrate more on dictation and learning by rote .", "questions": "The best title for this text would be", "options": {"model": ["rote learning is unlucky", "rote learning was the winner"], "human": ["The Problem of Child - centred Education", "Rote Learning Was the Winner"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
