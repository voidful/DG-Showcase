{"id": "3928", "article": "Tests administered to most elementary and high - school students in the United States exert an unfavorable influence on science and math teaching , according to a new $ 1 million study performed for the National Science Foundation . And because schools with high minority enrollments generally place a greater reliance on scores from these tests , the study finds , there tends to be \" a gap in instructional emphases between high and low minority classrooms that differs from our national concern for the quality of education . \" George F . Madaus and his colleagues at Boston College analyzed not only the six most widely used national standardized tests , but also the tests designed to accompany ( go with ) the four most commonly used science and math texts in fourth - grade , eighth - grade , and high - school classrooms . Though curriculum ( teaching program ) experts argue that schools should place greater emphasis on problem solving and reasoning , the new study shows that the tests focus on lower - level skills - - primarily mechanical memorization of routine formulas . Researchers surveyed more than 2 , 200 math and science instructors , interviewing in depth some 300 teachers and administrators . Especially in schools with high minority enrollments , teachers reported feeling pressured to help students perform well on these tests . Some states judge schools and some schools determine teacher assignments based on students ' test scores . \" With so much worry , \" Madaus says , \" teachers feel forced to focus their instruction on drilling what the tests will measure - - at the expense of the more valuable , higher - level skills . \"", "questions": "The author of this article states that", "options": {"model": ["the students are not satisfied with the present tests", "the science and math teaching is influenced by the present tests", "the tests are carried out in the us", "the number of high - school students in the united states is increasing"], "human": ["the tests do n ' t affect teaching in most elementary and high schools", "no study is performed on tests for the National Science Foundation", "the United States exerts a strong influence on science and math teaching", "the science and math teaching is influenced by the present tests"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
