{"id": "5", "article": "Teachers say the digital age has had a good influence - and a not - so - good influence - on this generation of American teenagers . More than 2 , 000 teachers took an online survey . Three - quarters of the teachers said the Internet and digital search tools have had a \" mostly positive \" effect on their students ' research habits and skills . But 64 percent said the technologies \" do more to distract ( - - - - - - ) students than to help them academically . \" And 87 percent agreed that these technologies are creating an \" easily distracted generation with short attention spans . \" The Pew Internet Project did the survey with the National Writing Project . Judy Buchanan is the vice director of the National Writing Project and a co - author of the report . Ms . Buchanan says digital research tools are helping students learn more and faster . \" Teachers really favor these tools because they are ways to make some of the learning exciting and engaging . Young people favor these tools . The goal is to really help them become creators of meaningful content , and not just sort of consumers . \" But one problem the survey found is that many students lack digital literacy . They trust too muck of the information they find on the Internet . Judy says these students have n ' t developed the skills to determine the quality of online information . \" It ' s something that really has to be taught and paid attention to . Because in a world in which things happen quickly , you do need to step back , reflect and analyze the information you have . \" Another problem is blamed on something that might not seem like a problem at all : being able to quickly find information online . Teachers say the result is a reduction in the desire and ability of their students to work hard to find answers . They say students are overly dependent on search engines and do not make enough use of printed books or research libraries . Many teachers are also concerned that the Internet makes it easy for students to copy work done by others instead of using their own abilities .", "questions": "Some students do n ' t tend to work hard because", "options": {"model": ["they do n ' t have a good knowledge of the information", "they can get answers on the internet quickly"], "human": ["the Internet ca n ' t make students concentrate", "they can get answers on the Internet quickly"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
