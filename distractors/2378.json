{"id": "2378", "article": "World Car Free Day is a very important day on the environmental calendar . Every September 22 , governments , green groups and ordinary citizens stress the damage cars are doing to the earth . The day is a reminder that we do not need to rely so much on cars . Those who take part in the activity hope that we all should realize we do not have to accept our car - controlled society . Carlos Pardo from Colombia ' s Sustainable Urban Transport Project said , \" World Car Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city , but a demonstration of traffic - free streets and clean air is possible . But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to normal life . When people get out of their cars , they should stay out of their cars . It is up to us , our cities and our governments to help create lasting change to benefit walkers , cyclists and other people who do not drive cars . \" Car - free days were organized as early as during the 1970s , and several car - free days were organized in European cities during the early 1990s . An international car - free day was organized in Europe in 1999 . The European Union adopted the idea in 2000 . Today , as many as 100 million people in over 1500 cities worldwide celebrate this day . World Car Free Day aims to take a large number of cars off the streets for all or part of a day . This will give people a chance to see what their town might look like with fewer cars . But some people say it is a one - day trick and does not make people give up their cars for the rest of the year . They say what is needed is a move towards a more sustainable city transportation system .", "questions": "September 22 is a day", "options": {"model": ["that gives us a chance to see what their town would look like with fewer cars", "that reminds us to drive our cars less", "that helps to make cars free"], "human": ["when cars cause no damage to the earth", "that tells us to refuse to drive any cars", "that reminds us to drive our cars less"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
