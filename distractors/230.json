{"id": "230", "article": "When I was young , I had an old neighbor named Dr . Gibbs . He did n ' t look like any doctor I ' d ever known . He never shouted at us for playing in his yard . I remembered him as a neighbor who was nicer than anyone else in the neighborhood . When Dr . Gibbs was happy , he was planting trees . And his life ' s goal was to make it a forest . Dr . Gibbs had some interesting theories about planting . He talked about trees that were n ' t watered would grow deep roots in search of water . So he never watered his trees . He planted anoak and , instead of watering it every morning , he beat it with the rolled - up newspaper . I asked him why he did that , and he said it was to get the tree ' s attention . Dr . Gibbs died a couple of years . Every now and again , I walk by his house and look at the trees that he planted twenty - five years ago . They ' re very strong now . I planted a couple of trees a few years later . I watered them regularly and took good care of them . Whenever a cold wind blows , they shake their leaves and branches . The funny thing about those trees of Dr . Gibbs was that difficulty seemed to help them in ways comfort and ease never could .", "questions": "What does the writer mainly want to tell us ?", "options": {"model": ["difficulty is necessary for growth .", "difficulty is more important than dr . blake ' s .", "watering trees is a good idea ."], "human": ["Trees are not as weak as we think .", "Planting trees is good for the environment .", "Difficulty is necessary for growth ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
