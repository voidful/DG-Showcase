{"id": "2562", "article": "The time of year a baby is born can shape what profession they will embark on in later life , a new study has suggested . Being born in a certain month appears to indicate the statistical likelihood of what job a person will end up with , the study by the Office for National Statistics found . Researchers have uncovered that the month in which babies are born could also affect everything from intelligence to length of life . A child born December is more likely to become a dentist while someone whose birthday falls in January will tend to a debt collector , they found . A February birth appears to increase the chances of being an artist while March babies appear to go on to become pilots . Meanwhile , April and May are said to have a fairly even spread of professions , births in the summer months mean a much lower chance of becoming a high - earning football player , doctor or dentist . The study was derived by researchers who analyzed the birth months of people in 19 separate occupations using information from the last census , the Daily Mail reported . Although these trends may be difficult to explain , correlations between birth months and specific health problems have a scientific basis . Spring babies are at greater risks of illnesses including schizophrenia , Alzheimer ' s disease , asthma and autism . They may also be less clever than classmates born in other parts of the year .", "questions": "What do the researchers also study besides the analyses of the trends between birth months and professions ?", "options": {"model": ["the relationship between birth months and certain health problems .", "the reason why a baby is born in later life .", "the amount of time of year a baby is born .", "the reason why a baby is born ."], "human": ["Some serious diseases from births of many children .", "A lot of mental illnesses caused by giving birth to children .", "The secret of births and healthy problems .", "The relationship between birth months and certain health problems ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
