{"id": "123", "article": "I still remember the last time I went to the playground with two of my children . It had rained during the night and the playground was very muddy . They had just put on clean clothes , so I was a little worried about the mud on the playground . It was not long before Kathy got her beautiful skirt dirty on the playground . She dug through the rocks . I was about to blame her for getting her clothes dirty when she ran towards me with a smile on her face . When she got to me , she handed me a little heart - shaped rock and said , \" Here , Mom ! Here is a heart for you - - just because I love you ! Keep it ! \" With tears in my eyes , I thanked her . Should I blame her for getting her clothes muddy ? No way ! I still have that little heart - shaped rock . It is one of the best gifts that I have ever received . I realized that many times it was not necessary for us adults to worry about the small things our children did . Let them do what they ' d like to . I will spend a lot more time on the playground with my children . I ' m sure I will learn a lot from them . It makes me think of the days when my grandfather told me , \" You would not enter the kingdom of happiness until you pretended to be a small child . \"", "questions": "The author was deeply moved by her daughter ' s", "options": {"model": ["special way to show her love to the children", "special way to show her love", "different ways to show her love"], "human": ["digging task on the playground", "love of the muddy playground", "special way to show her love"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
