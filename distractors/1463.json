Obama spoke about the importance of studying abroad . \" Studying in a country like China is about so much more than just improving your own prospects in the global market .

Mrs . Obama encouraged students to set aside the opinion that studying abroad is for \" rich kids only \" or for those attending \" certain schools \" .
