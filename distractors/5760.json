{"id": "5760", "article": "Is it important to have breakfast every day ? A short time ago , a test was given in the United States . People of different ages , from 12 to 83 , were asked to have a test . During the test , these people were given all kinds of breakfast , and sometimes they got no breakfast at all . Scientists wanted to see how well their bodies worked after eating different kinds of breakfast . The results show that if a person eats a right breakfast , he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast . If a student has fruit , eggs , bread and milk before going to school , he or she will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class . Some people think it will help you lose weight if you have no breakfast . But the result is opposite to what they think . This is because people become so hungry at noon that they eat too much for lunch . They will gain weight instead of losing it .", "questions": "What do the results show ?", "options": {"model": ["they show that breakfast is the most important meal for a person .", "they show that a person has no breakfast .", "they show that breakfast has affected on work and studies .", "they show that breakfast has nothing to do with work and studies ."], "human": ["The results show that breakfast has little to do with a person ' s work .", "The results show that a person will work better if he only has fruit and milk .", "They show that girl students should have less for breakfast .", "They show that breakfast has affected on work and studies ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
