{"id": "652", "article": "For centuries , mankind and dogs have suffered from a communication failure . We can tell dogs what we want them to do and sometimes they comply , but we ' ve always struggled when it comes to understanding the true meaning of their barks and whimpers . There is exciting news now - a dog translator has been invented to help you communicate with your furry friend . Researchers at North Carolina State University have fashioned some kind of miracle dog translator body harness . What ' s special about it is that it does n ' t just rely on the dog ' s vocalizations to interpret what Fido is banging on about . Oh no - this miracle harness reads and interprets the ordinary dogs ' body language as well , giving us a full two - way dog communication experience . Researcher David Roberts says : \" Dogs communicate primarily through body language , and one of our challenges was to develop sensors that tell us about their behavior by observing their posture remotely . \" Sensors on the harness monitor the dog ' s heart rate and body temperature and software builds up a vocabulary , letting the human know what the dog is feeling . What would dogs say if they could talk to us ? The human can even communicate back through the harness thanks to vibration motors , supposedly by tapping into the dog ' s senses so that it can understand what you ' re trying to say to it . The dog harness is designed for dogs involved in search and rescue and other front - line work , but it ' s got us dreaming of a beautiful future , one where humans and dogs can co - exist as equals , with the dog able to fully express itself at all times .", "questions": "Why ca n ' t people communicate with dogs ?", "options": {"model": ["they do n ' t have enough body language to communicate with .", "they have difficulty understanding dogs ' barks and whimpers ."], "human": ["They do n ' t know how to tell dogs what they want them to do .", "They have difficulty understanding dogs ' barks and whimpers ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
