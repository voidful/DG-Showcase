{"id": "2301", "article": "Part of the magic in movies is the costumes . They can transform a normal - looking actor into a cowboy , a space alien or even a superhero . Costumes for movies are designed and created by a whole team of people , according to Courtney Daniel , a Toronto - based costume designer who worked on the recent movie Night At The Museum . As a designer , she does research to find out what details are needed to make a costume work , and what makes sense for a specific movie . In Night At The Museum , she and a few other designers spent time at libraries and museums studying everything from what cowboys should wear , to what ancient Egyptians and Huns would have put on . Once they got the information they needed , they figured out what fabrics to use and how to put them together . The designers even changed a few details to make the costumes more \" movie friendly \" . For example , more colour and extra touches helped historical costumes to be alive for kids . One example of this is the costume for the role in the movie Night At The Museum , an Indian woman Sacagawea , which has a shorter skirt and fits more closely than the clothes the real Sacagawea would have worn . Daniel has also worked on costumes for other big - name movies , such as the second and third X - Men movies , and Catwoman . If you are . interested in being a costume designer , it helps to have an interest in sewing . She said , \" Learning how to sew , and how different fabrics and materials work is important . \" So is knowing how to carry out research , Daniel ' s degree in art history helped in this area .", "questions": "What do we know about the movie Night At The Museum ?", "options": {"model": ["it is designed by an indian woman sacagawea", "sacagawea is one of the characters in it ."], "human": ["It is about the evolution of costumes .", "Sacagawea is one of the characters in it ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
