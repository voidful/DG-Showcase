{"id": "450", "article": "An inventor seeks to create a new product that serves a specific need and fulfills a role that other products do not . Sometimes an inventor comes up with a wholly new idea , but more often inventions are simply improvements on an older design . With a little imagination and creativity , an old idea can suddenly become something new . However , creating a new invention means much more than having a brilliant idea . A good designer follows the design process : identifying the challenge , researching and brainstorming ideas , designing a solution , testing and evaluating the ideas , and finally building the product . Designers also use science , math , technology , and engineering to design a tool that satisfies the need they identified . Anyone can be an inventor - - even kids ! For example , Chester Greenwood was just fifteen years old when he invented a product that changed his life . In fact , his idea was so good that his invention supported him for the rest of his life . You may not know his name , but you probably know his invention - - earmuffs ! The inspiration for his earmuff design came to Chester when he was ice - skating . His ears were cold , and he decided to find a way to keep them warm . With the help of his grandmother , he made a new product to protect his ears and at the age of eighteen , Chester patented his earmuff design . Many other famous inventors started young as well . Margaret Knight - - the inventor of the flat - bottomed brown paper bag - - is said to have created a safety device for textile looms when she was just twelve years old . Another example is Thomas Edison , one of the greatest inventors in history , who applied for his first patent when he was just twenty - one years old . Over the course of his life , Thomas Edison patented a total of 1 , 093 inventions !", "questions": "At first Chester designed his earmuffs in order to", "options": {"model": ["protect his ears while cold", "protect his ears while ice - skating"], "human": ["realize his dream of becoming an inventor", "protect his ears while ice - skating"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
