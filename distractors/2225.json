{"id": "2225", "article": "A survey by an international temporary service agency found that U . S . managers believe that people with a sense of humour do better at their jobs , compared with those who have little or no sense of humour . In fact , about 96 percent of those surveyed said people with a sense of humour do better . The survey went on to point out that the results suggest that a sense of humour may help light - hearted employees keep their jobs during tough times . And , what ' s more , it may push them up the corporate ladder past their humourless colleagues . Why ? It seems that those with a sense of humour are better communicators and better team players . Studies have shown that happy workers are more productive . In fact , a researcher at California State University found that humour could help the employees to release tension . Research done by psychologist Dr . Ashton Trice at Mary Baldwin College in Virginia showed that humour helps us think . When people feel stuck on important projects , they tend to feel angry or depressed . According to Dr . Trice ' s research , taking time out to laugh can help us to get rid of negative feelings and allow us to return to a task or move on to another project unaffected by past defeat . If humour is really this important , then why do n ' t we use it more often on the job ? Most likely , the main reason is that many people are unaware of the positive effects of humour in the workplace . However , it is important to realize that some humour is not suitable for the workplace , and that it is often used at wrong times .", "questions": "What is probably the best title for the article ?", "options": {"model": ["the importance of a sense of humour", "humour is important in the workplace .", "how to get rid of different people ' s feelings .", "the importance of humour ."], "human": ["People with a Sense of Humour .", "Humour and Humourless .", "Everyone Likes Humour .", "Humour Is Important in the Workplace ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
