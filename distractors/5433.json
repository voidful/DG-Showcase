{"id": "5433", "article": "There are many different kinds of disasters around the world . As an adult you know what to do during a disaster , but what about the children ? Some adults think it would probably never happen to them , so they do n ' t teach their children what to do . Before it ' s too late , here are ways to help you prepare your child for a disaster : Educate : It is always good to let your child know about possible disasters . This does n ' t mean children have to live in fear . When teaching them about disasters , keep the conversation positive by telling them there is a solution to the disaster . Keep the conversations short , allow for questions and answer honestly . Prepare : Always be prepared , that is the best advice for children . For example , when preparing for bad weather , get the tools you need , like candles , radios , food , water and medicine . Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them , if ever needed . Plan : You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation . Write out a simple list that they can read . The plan could start with \" listen to an adult ' s advice and / or call 119 \" . Practice : Once you have got the correct safety tools and worked out the right plan , practice every few months . Practicing what to do during a disaster with your child will help them if the time comes . Disasters ca n ' t be avoided but they can be lessened once you are prepared and ready for one .", "questions": "What is NOT suggested doing ?", "options": {"model": ["helping people in disaster areas .", "helping people to know about the disaster .", "persuading children to learn about disaster ."], "human": ["Remembering what is needed in certain disasters .", "Getting the children to know the plan well .", "Helping people in disaster areas ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
