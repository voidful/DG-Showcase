A new study used a computer model to predict - how just three grams less a day would affect heart disease in the United States . The result : Thirteen percent fewer heart attacks . Eight percent fewer strokes . Four percent fewer deaths . Eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease . And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings . Researchers found it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety - two thousand deaths every year . The study is in the New England Journal of Medicine . Kirsten Bibbins - Domingo at the University of California San Francisco was the lead author . She says people would not even notice a difference in taste with three grams , or one - half teaspoon , less salt per day . The team also included researchers at Stanford and Columbia University . Each gram of salt contains four hundred milligrams of sodiu , which is how foods may list their salt content . The government says the average American man eats ten grams of salt a day . The American Heart Association advises no more than three grams for healthy people . It says salt in the American diet has increased fifty percent since the nineteen seventies , while blood pressures have also risen . Less salt can mean a lower blood pressure . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is leading an effort called the National Salt Reduction Initiative . The idea is to put pressure on food companies and restaurants . Critics call it government interference . Mayor Bloomberg has already succeeded in other areas , like requiring fast food places in the city to list calorie information . Now a study by the Seattle Children ' s Research Institute shows that the calorie information on the menu can influence what parents order for their children . Ninety - nine parents of three to six year olds took part . Half had calories between the two groups for foods that the parents would have chosen for themselves . McDonald ' s menus clearly showing how many calories were in each food . Parents given the counts chose an average of one hundred two fewer calories when asked what they would order for their children . Yet there was no difference in calories between the two groups for foods that the parents would have chosen for themselves .
