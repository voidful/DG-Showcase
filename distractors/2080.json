{"id": "2080", "article": "At the heart of the debate over illegal immigration lies one key question : are immigrants good or bad for the economy ? The American public overwhelmingly thinks they ' re bad . Yet the agreement among most economists is that immigration , both legal and illegal , provides a small net boost to the economy . Immigrants provide cheap labor , lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes , and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets . So why is there such a discrepancy between the perception of immigrants ' impact on the economy and the reality ? There are a number of familiar theories . Some argue that people are anxious and feel threatened by an inflow of new workers . Others highlight the stress that undocumented immigrants place on public services , like schools , hospitals , and jails . Still others emphasize the role of race , arguing that foreigners add to the nation ' s fears and insecurities . There ' s some truth to all these explanations , but they are n ' t quite sufficient . To get a better understanding of what ' s going on , consider the way immigration ' s impact is felt . Though its overall effect may be positive , its costs and benefits are distributed unevenly . David Card , an economist at UC Berkeley , notes that the ones who profit most directly from immigrants ' low - cost labor are businesses and employers - - meatpacking plants in Nebraska , for instance , these producers ' savings probably translate into lower prices at the grocery store , but how many consumers make that mental connection at the checkout counter ? As for the drawbacks of illegal immigration , these , too , are concentrated . Native low - skilled workers suffer most from the competition of foreign labor . According to a study by George Borjas , a Harvard economist , immigration has reduced the wages of American high - school dropouts by 9 % . Among high - skilled , better - educated employees , however , opposition was strongest in states with both high numbers of immigrants and relatively generous social services . What worried them most , in other words , was the financial burden of immigration . That conclusion was reinforced by another finding : that their opposition appeared to soften when that financial burden decreased , as occurred with welfare reform in the 1990s , which curbed immigrants ' access to certain benefits .
