{"id": "2990", "article": "A few days ago , I was sitting in a Thai restaurant enjoying a meal when I got on a phone call from a friend I had n ' t spoken to in a long time . In my enthusiasm and excitement , I talked quite louder than usual voice and in Spanish , my mother tongue . A few minutes into the call , an old lady sitting at the table beside mine got up , seemingly offended , and asked the restaurant staff to relocate a table as far away as possible from this man who seemed to be impolite . I sank in my seat out of embarrassment . I ended the call soon afterwards and felt the urge to apologize . Before getting up , I looked around to see where she was and she was at the table farthest away from me . I noticed that the lady was alone and staring out the window . I found a tinge of sadness or anxiety and perhaps a desire for aloneness and peace . But I had obviously destroyed it minutes earlier . Right then I abandoned my plan for a conventional apologetic gesture . Seeing those funny smile cards in my wallet , I took one out and wrote some words to express my apology . On signing my restaurant bill , I asked a waiter to secretly charge the lady ' s meal to me and hand her the smile card instead of her bill . Did she take it the wrong way , I wondered ? Did she get confused ? Did she refuse the anonymous offer ? And so on . I just waited and felt nervous to learn the outcome . To my pleasant surprise , things turned out the best possible way . The waiter approached me in a joy , telling me , \" In the many times she had dined here before , I had never seen the old lady smile as she did when receiving the smile card and the $ 0 bill . She thanked me even though I explained that someone else did the job . \"", "questions": "Feeling sorry , the author offered the old lady the following EXCEPT", "options": {"model": ["an apologetic gesture", "a good smile card"], "human": ["a smile card", "an apologetic gesture"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
