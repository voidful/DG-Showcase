This time , I thought , it is being played for me , as much as for anyone else . This is organized major league baseball , and I am standing here with all the others ; and everything that takes place includes me . About a year later , I went to Atlanta , Georgia , to play in an exhibition game . On the field , for the first time in Atlanta , there were Negroes and whites . Other Negroes besides me .
