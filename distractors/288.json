{"id": "288", "article": "Elizabeth Freeman was born about 1742 to African American parents who were slaves . At the age of six months she was acquired , along with her sister , by John Ashley , a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders . She became known as \" Mumbet \" or \" Mum Bett . \" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family . One day , Ashley ' s wife tried to strike Mumbet ' s sister with a spade . Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead . Furious , she left the house and refused to come back . When the Ashleys tried to make her return , Mumbet consulted a lawyer , Theodore Sedgewick . With his help , Mumbet sued for her freedom . While serving the Ashleys , Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution . If the constitution said that all people were free and equal , then she thought it should apply to her . Eventually , Mumbet won her freedom - - - - the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution . Strangely enough , after the trial , the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee . She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick . Mumbet died in 1829 , but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great - grandchildren was W . E . B . Du Bois , one of the founder of the NAACP , and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights . Mumbet ' s tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried . It reads , in part : \" She was born a slave and remained a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years . She could neither read nor write , yet in her own sphere she had no superior or equal . \"", "questions": "What did Mumbet do after the trial ?", "options": {"model": ["she chose to work for a lawyer", "she asked a man to come back and work for her"], "human": ["She continued to serve the Ashleys", "She chose to work for a lawyer"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
