{"id": "5668", "article": "The southwest of Australia has been named as one of 25 \" hot spots \" for future species extinction because of global warming . A new study says global warming will become a top cause of extinction across the world , with thousands of species of plantsand animals likely to be wiped out in the coming decades . According to the study , global warming ranks among the most serious threats to the planet ' s biodiversity and , under some conditions , may be more than that due to deforestation . This study provides even stronger scientific evidence that global warming will result in catastrophic species losses across the planet . Last month , a UN study said humans were responsible for the worst extinction and urged extra efforts to reach a UN target of slowing the rate of losses by 2010 . Scientists disagree about how far global warming is to blame compared with other human threats such as deforestation , pollution and the introduction of some species to new habitats . But the new study looks at the 25 \" hot spots \" - - areas that contain a big concentration of plants and animals - - and predicts that 11 . 6 percent of all species , with a range from 1 to 43 percent , could be driven to extinction if levels of heat trapping gases in the atmosphere were to keep rising in the next 100 years . The range would mean the loss of thousands of species . The study gave a wide range because of uncertainties , for instance , about the ability of animals or plants to move towards the poles if the climate warmed . Rare plants , tortoises or birds found only on the southern tip of Africa can not move south because the nearest land is thousands of miles away in Antarctica .", "questions": "What would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["global warming causes global warming", "global warming and species extinction", "global warming and climate"], "human": ["Global Warming is Number One Killer", "Australia on the Edge of Extinction", "Global Warming and Species Extinction"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
