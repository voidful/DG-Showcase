{"id": "203", "article": "When Beijing is hit by smog , residents often joke that the Chinese capital needs to build giant fans to clear out the polluted air . Mountains to the north and west help trap smog in the city , and a strong wind from Mongolia is the surest way to ensure cleaner air . Beijing officials are now considering ways to help that process . Though giant fans are not on the menu , at least not yet , city planners are looking at ways to create corridors that encourage wind flow through the capital . The plan is inspired by research on urban heat islands , which shows that large buildings that block the wind are one of the causes of higher average temperatures in cities as opposed to those in the countryside . \" This is n ' t controlling pollution . It ' s shifting the problem . \" Wang Bing , a Beijing - based author , wrote on Sina Weibo . But the plan has received some interest from residents who have grown tired of repeated periods of heavy pollution . Peng Yingdeng , an air pollution expert at the Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environmental Protection , told the newspaper that the plan was more likely to require an adjustment of related laws to limit building heights and numbers in some areas . Similar proposals are under consideration in other major Chinese cities including Hangzhou , Nanjing , Shenyang and Wuhan . \" This kind of work to search for ways to reduce pollution is really worth applauding , \" the state - run news agency Xinhua said in a commentary . \" If scientists confirm it is effective , then we should promote it on a much larger scale . \" Some experts have expressed doubts whether the plan would make a significant difference . Serious pollution is usually associated with periods of little or no wind , and air corridors do little good if the wind is n ' t blowing , Song Guojun , an environmental science professor told The Beijing News . Solving the air pollution problem mainly requires controlling pollution sources .", "questions": "What is the solution to pollution problem according to Song Guojun ?", "options": {"model": ["to make full use of the wind .", "to protect the environment .", "to control pollution sources ."], "human": ["To build giants fans .", "To construct air corridors .", "To control pollution sources ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
