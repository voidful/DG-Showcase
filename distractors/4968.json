{"id": "4968", "article": "Prana , our beautiful dog whose name means ' breath of life ' , is n ' t with us any more . But she brought such joy and love that we still miss her . There are so many wonderful stories about the love in this dog , but my favorite is this one . It was an autumn day in Minnesota , but the weather did n ' t know the difference between autumn and winter . Unexpectedly , we were hit with a big snow fall for which no one was prepared . We have two apple trees in our backyard . Prana loved apples . When she went outside , she ' d take hold of an apple , put it far back in her mouth , and _ the house to save for eating later . The apples had been on the ground and were often dirty so I was n ' t always happy that Prana had brought them into the house . Feeling my displeasure , she would turn her head so I would n ' t see her hidden treasure . On the day that it snowed too early in the season , Prana went outside and I watched her from the window . I noticed that she was madly digging holes and brought the apples to the surface so they could be seen above the snow . I wondered why she was doing this . She seemed to be completely busy with some kind of important task to dig up as many apples as possible during her yard time . When I called her back into the house , she had her usual one apple in her mouth . About five minutes later , I looked outside . The yard was completely covered with birds . Prana had dug up all those apples for her bird friends to eat . She knew that they would n ' t have stored enough food to live through such an early winter .", "questions": "From the story we can learn that", "options": {"model": ["the writer did n ' t know the difference between autumn and winter", "the apples had been on the ground and were often clean", "prana is especially loving and thoughtful", "the apples had been on the ground for a long time"], "human": ["Prana is helpful to the writer", "Prana is devoted to the writer", "Prana is not only beautiful but also joyful", "Prana is especially loving and thoughtful"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
