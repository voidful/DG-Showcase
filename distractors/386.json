She carefully dips the bowl forward , dropping the porridge directly down her throat , careful not to touch the 15 ulcers in her mouth . But it was the week before midterms , so she still had to study . Jeon was 1st out of 330 students on her exams that year . \" Thank god I did , \" she says . \" If I had n ' t done well I would have been regarded as a failure . \" By the end of the week , 14 - year - old Jeon weighed only 83 . 6 pounds . Like Jeon , there are countless numbers of first generation Asian - Americans who make great efforts to go beyond at everything .

According to Jeon , Asians complain that students with a 4 . 0 GPA and 2400 SAT simply can not be rejected from top schools . To their disappointment , however , they often are .
