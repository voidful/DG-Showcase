{"id": "2175", "article": "What are American high schools like ? Well , I ' m happy to tell you what I know . When I started school here , it had already been a week since the school opened . At this school , freshmen usually go on a trip for about three days at the beginning of school . Unfortunately I missed that wonderful trip , which would have been the best time to get to know my classmates . I was really sad . I wished I ' d known about it earlier . Despite the disappointment , however , I gradually adapted to my new life and school . There is a space in the basement of the teaching building where students chat and meet each other . As we do not always have the same classrooms and classmates , the school wants us to get to know each other there . Students usually come to school early , sit in that space and have fun . Around the space , there are many lockers for students to leave their books in , so that students do not have to carry a heavy schoolbag everywhere . It really surprises me that we have almost no textbooks . We only have textbooks for World History and Algebra 2 and they are big and heavy , like bricks . For other classes , we only need binders with paper in them . Without textbooks , students learn things freely and actively . For example , my humanities teacher just teaches us what is in her mind at the time . We never know what we will learn . Another difference between American schools and Chinese schools is that American schools care about students ' morality more than their academic studies . For example , if you do not finish your homework , you will just be asked to do it later , but if you cheat or lie , you will get a warning or even be kicked out . I think that most students here are good at schoolwork as well , but compared to Chinese students , they can make learning a more joyful experience . I think we should take the good points from our two different kinds of education to perfect our approach to studying .", "questions": "What was the writer sad for ?", "options": {"model": ["he could n ' t find a good school .", "he could n ' t get to know the school well .", "he missed the trip at the beginning of school .", "he could n ' t get to know his classmates at the beginning of the school ."], "human": ["He was late for school .", "He did n ' t know anyone .", "American students looked down upon him .", "He missed the trip at the beginning of school ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
