Do you have any pity on them who are so poor and lonely or do you just feel afraid of their terrible shapes ? As one of the most special groups , disabled people ' s living conditions - - not only their material conditions , but their mental world - - really need improvement . The treatment for disabled people should go like this : First , do n ' t look down upon them . Do n ' t be afraid of looking at the terrible shapes of the disabled . Try to treat them _ . Because they are a part of the society , we ca nt discard them . The second is to help them as much as we could . If you can be a volunteer and do some work for the disabled people , that would be very nice .
