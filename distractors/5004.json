{"id": "5004", "article": "I love to tell the story about how I met my best friend - Tiger . We met at the school fair . Each year , all the fourth - grade classes hold a school fair . Everyone in the fourth grade works at the fair . Some sell ice cream , drinks and snacks , others take care of the little children who ride the horses . I got the second job and I ' ve never forgotten it , because that ' s where I met Tiger . My job was to help little children get on the back of a little horse . I kept telling the children to wait their turn and holding ice cream for them while they rode about . It ' s clear that I was growing older and should be more responsible . Suddenly , a boy came to the horse . He took the little horse ' s reins ! The horse stopped , and the girl on its back started to fall . I was trying to reach the girl when I saw Tiger go by my legs . It held the horse ' s reins and pulled the horse away from my legs . I caught the girl just before we both hit the ground . The girl sat on top of me . She was laughing at the ice cream on my face . The horse ' s reins were in Tiger ' s mouth ! Thanks to Tiger ' s fast action , I saved the little girl . We were both heroes . And Tiger , the fastest dog I ' ve ever known became my new best friend .", "questions": "The writer ' s job was to", "options": {"model": ["look after the children", "take the little horse ' s rider", "take care of the little children", "ride the horse"], "human": ["feed the horse", "ride the horse", "take care of the horse", "look after the children"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
