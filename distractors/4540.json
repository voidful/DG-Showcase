{"id": "4540", "article": "What part - time job do you do now ? What do you do want to do in the future ? Leave your comment here ! I ' ve been working at Burger Bam for two months . I thought I ' d hate it , but it ' s been really good . I ' ve learned a lot how to work with people I would never normally meet . And I ' m not as shy as I was . I do n ' t think I want to work there forever , but it ' s given me some ideas about how to run a business . Maybe I ' ll learn business when I go to college . Abby , 15 , from Toronto I ' ve had my own web design business for a year . I ' ve designed about 20 websites for my friends . I ' ve been doing most of the work on the weekends after I do my homework ! I ' ve bought a new computer with the money I earned . A little restaurants in my neighborhood has asked me to design a website for them , so my business is growing . I ' m not sure what I want to do in the future , but I really like art and design . Maybe I should go into advertising . Kwan , 14 , from Seattle I ' ve been volunteering at a senior citizen center on Saturday mornings . Some of my friends think I ' m crazy , doing a job for no money , but I really like it . I think that in a few months , I ' ll try to get a paid part - time job in a law office because I want to study law in the future . There ' s a lot of competition for part - time jobs , but I think my volunteering will look good on my resume .
