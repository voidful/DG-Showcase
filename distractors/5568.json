{"id": "5568", "article": "When I left my bag on a train , I lost my most precious possession , a small framed photograph of my great grandparents , Emily and Gordon Baker . The frame was made of silver , with an elegant flower design in one corner . The photograph was taken in March 1939 on their wedding day . Emily looked very happy , and Gordon looked rather alarmed . A few months later , he was killed in action in North Africa . I received the photograph when my aunt Mabel died . I ' m a student at Edinburgh University and I live in an old Edwardian house . At the end of last term , I packed a large bag and a small bag and set off for London , where I was planning to catch the Eurostar train to Paris . Minutes after getting off the train at Kings Cross Station , I realized that I ' d left the small bag in the overhead luggage rack . I ran back to the train , but it had already left the platform . This all happened several months ago , and I had become resigned to the loss of my most precious possession . Then last week , something extraordinary happened . I logged onto the site Bay and looked for a silver photo frame and I found it ! The photo of my great grandparents was on Bay ! I called the person who was advertising it . He was a little suspicious at first , and told me that he had bought it from a stall at an antique market . After we talked for a while , he asked if there was any way I could prove it was mine . All I could think of was that the photo was taken in March 1939 . He opened the frame and made sure that this date was written by hand on the back of the photograph . \" It ' s definitely yours . \" he said . \" Come and get it ! \" 5 ( 11 )", "questions": "The man advertising the frame proved it was the author ' s", "options": {"model": ["by the post written on the photo", "by the date written on the back of the photo"], "human": ["according to the price of the silver frame", "by the date written on the back of the photo"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
