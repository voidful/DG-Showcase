Do you have courage ? \" She asked , running to her mother ' s bed . \" Courage is the brave breath . I have it . \" Her mother answered . The girl held out her little hands and asked her mother to give her . After her mother blew out two mouthfuls of breath into her little cold hands , the little girl clenched her fists nervousely , afraid that the \" breath of courage \" would run away . Then with her fists clenched , she walked out of the bedroom towards the bathroom with nothing to fear . Her mother said to herself , \" It ' ll be nice if someone can blow some kind of breath to me . Then I can hold it in my hands too when I feel terrified or lost . In fact , mostly , what we are terrified of is nothing but the fear in our mind .
