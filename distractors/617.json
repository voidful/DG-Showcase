{"id": "617", "article": "Known as the \" crazy nest lady \" , Katie Deline - Ray is n ' t quite sure how many mini handmade harbors she ' s knitted for injured baby animals . But she ' s certain it ' s a lot . Deline - Ray is founder of Wildlife Rescue Nests . She designs and makes strong , soft nests , which she donates to wildlife rescue groups to use as little recovery nests for sick and injured animals . She also shares her patterns for others to copy . Deline - Ray began making her nests in 2013 , while she was recovering from a broken hand , and \" spending too much time online . \" One thing led to another - - as happens on the internet - - and she discovered a woman who was making similar nests for U . S . - based wildlife groups , as an alternative to the hard boxes used to contain the animals these groups care for . \" I thought it was such a wonderful idea and went searching to see whether there was anything like it set up for our wildlife rescues in Canada , \" she says . \" To my surprise there was n ' t . So I started contacting wildlife rescues and they agreed to try some out . \" Some modifications were made to already - existing patterns . And then , like a little bird taking its first flight , the nests went out into the world . These days , Deline - Ray sends nests - - always for free - - to 60 - some wildlife rescue groups , where injured birds and rabbits nestle inside the soft spaces while they are recovering . Her future plans include making more nests , organizing new volunteer knitters and helping as many wildlife rescuers as possible take care of their animals in this charming way . \" I have no formal training with wildlife , just a great love for it . \" Deline - Ray says . \" I love making the nests because I have a great admiration for all the amazing work the wildlife rescues do . I feel like I have a part in giving back to wildlife in a small way . \"", "questions": "What can we infer from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["theine - ray is a member of the wildlife rescue group .", "katie deline - ray set up wildlife rescue nests based in canada .", "the woman who was making the nest has already been found by her .", "ray has made great efforts in making her nests online ."], "human": ["People must receive some training in order to help wildlife .", "Deline - Ray was once encouraged by an American woman .", "The nests Deline - Ray made were sold all over the world .", "Katie Deline - Ray set up Wildlife Rescue Nests based in Canada ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
