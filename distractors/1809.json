{"id": "1809", "article": "It is well - known that twins are closer to each other than most brothers and sisters - - - - after all , they probably spend more time with each other . Parents of twins often notice that they develop special ways of communicating : they invent their own words and one can often finish the other ' s sentence . In exceptional circumstances , this closeness becomes more extreme : they invent a whole language of their own , as in the case of Grace and Virginia Kennedy from Georgia in the USA , who communicated so successfully in their own special language that they did not speak any English at all until after they started school . However , these special relationships are the result of lives spent almost entirely in each other ' s company . What happens when twins do not grow up together , when they are separated at birth for some reason ? Are they just like any other strangers , or are there still special similarities between them ? Professor Tom Bouchard , of the University of Minnesota , set out to find the answer to this question . He traced sixteen pairs of twins , who were adopted by different families when they were babies , and often brought up in very different circumstances . Each twin was then interviewed about every small detail of their life . The results of this research make a surprising reading . Many of the twins were found to have the same hobbies , many have suffered the same illnesses , and some have even had the same type of accident at the same point in their lives . One pair of middle - aged women arrived for their first meeting in similar dresses , another pair were wearing similar jewellery . The most incredible similarities are to be found in the case of Jim Springer and Jim Lewis from Ohio in the USA . The story of the ' Jim Twins ' made headline news across USA . Born to an immigrant woman in 1939 , and adopted by different families at birth , both babies were named Jim by their new parents . But what can be the explanation for these remarkable similarities ? Is it all pure coincidence , or is the explanation in some way genetic ? Research into the lives of twins is forcing some experts to admit that our personalities may be at least partly due to ' nature ' . On the other hand , analysts are also anxious to emphasise that incredible coincidences do happen all the time , not just in the lives of twins .", "questions": "According to Tom Bouchard ' s research , the special similarities between twins", "options": {"model": ["are similar to those of those of the same family", "are not closely linked with where the twins are raised", "are similar to those of those of each other"], "human": ["depend on what the twins enjoy and suffer from", "result from the twins ' growing up and development", "are not closely linked with where the twins are raised"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
