China may breed a new group of bachelors , men caught in the trap of unaffordable houses . Since early 2009 , the housing market has once again become a hot pot at boiling point . Even with allowance and special government policies , home prices in China ' s first - tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are riding the crest of a rising wave . According to the \" 2010 China Marital Status Report \" released on Dec 15 , 2010 , about 70 percent of women interviewed said that housing , a stable income and some savings were the main requirements for marriage .

They often buy a house after the wedding , because more and more people are reconsidering their real estate worship , and going back to a more rational mode of consumption .
