{"id": "3590", "article": "The oil resources which are left will not last very long . This means that all vehicles such as cars , trains , buses , planes and ships that need oil to work will not be able to run . So it will be necessary to develop a new system of transport which uses a fuel more than oil . Electric vehicles are one possibility . In Britain , most families have at least one car and this car is used every day . It could be that only one person in the family drives the car to work or for shopping . The number of cars on the road which are almost empty perhaps helps to explain why the oil is used up so quickly . The family car is a very useful form of transport but it is also a great waste of energy , especially if it is compared with buses or trains . Much petrol is used by a car which is traveling at 120 kilometers an hour . Clearly , it would be better if there were fewer cars on the road and more speed limits so that the oil which is left will last as long as possible . About 25 % of Britain ' s total consumption of energy is _ - - it is used only in the home . Just over 20 % is used for transport . Most of the energy is used in industry . It is difficult to suggest any possible energy conservation in industry because many of the suggestions would mean that some people would lose their jobs . It is important that industry produces the same amount of products using the same amount of workers . Obviously , conservation is not going to be the answer to the energy crisis . The most it can do is to give more time for a better solution to be found . The more time which is available for new sources of energy to be developed , the better it is because there is still a lot of work to be done in order to find suitable , safe methods of producing energy .", "questions": "What is a better way to solve the problem of the energy crisis ?", "options": {"model": ["new sources of energy should be found and developed .", "some people would lose their jobs in the future ."], "human": ["Governments should cut down the number of family cars on the road .", "New sources of energy should be found and developed ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
