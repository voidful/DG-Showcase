{"id": "884", "article": "Whether you ' re eating at a fancy restaurant or dining in someone ' s home . Proper table manners are likely to help you make a good impression . According to a US expert , Emily Post , \" All rules of table manners are made to avoid ugliness . \" While Henry Hitchings of the Los Angeles Times admits that good manners can reduce social conflict , he points out that mostly their purpose is protective - they turn our natural warrior - like selves into more elegant ones . So where did table manners come from ? In medieval England , a writer named Petrus Alfonsi took the lead to urge people not to speak with their mouths full . And King David I of Scotland also proposed that any of his people who learned to eat more neatly be given a tax deduction . Disappointingly , that idea never _ . It was during the Renaissance , when there were real technical developments , opinions of correct behavior changed for good . \" None of these was more significant than the introduction of the table fork , \" wrote Hitchings . \" Gradually , as forks became popular , they brought the new way of eating , making it possible , for instance , to consume berries without making one ' s fingers dirty . \" Forks were introduced to Britain in 1608 and 25 years later , the first table fork reached America . Yet while most of the essentials are the same on both sides of the Atlantic , there are a few clear differences between what ' s normal in the US and what holds true in the UK . For example , in the US , when food needs cutting with a knife , people generally cut a bite , then lay aside the knife and switch the fork to their right hand . Then they pick up one bite at a time . By contrast , Britons keep the fork in the left hand and do n ' t lay the knife down . Though globalization has developed a new , simpler international standard of table manners , some people still stick with the American cut - and - switch method . The Los Angeles Times noted , \" They are hanging on to a form of behavior that favors manners above efficiency . \"", "questions": "Which of the following events influenced people ' s table manners most according to the article ?", "options": {"model": ["the introduction of forks .", "the development of table manners ."], "human": ["Petrus Alfonsi ' s efforts in promoting table manners .", "The introduction of forks ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
