{"id": "4460", "article": "One day , I went to see my last patient , an old woman . In the doorway , I saw she was struggling to put socks on her swollen feet in the bed . I stepped in , spoke quickly to the nurse , read her chart noting . I was almost in the clear that she was not in serious condition . I asked , \" Could I help put on your socks ? How are you feeling ? Your sugars and blood pressure were high but they ' re better today . The nurse mentioned you ' re anxious to see your son . He ' s visiting you today . It ' s nice to have a family visit . I think you really look forward to seeing him . \" \" Sit down , doctor . This is my story , not yours . \" She said with a serious voice . I was surprised as I helped her with the socks . She told me that her only son lived across from her house , but she had not seen him for five years . She believed that was the main cause of her health problems . After hearing her story and putting on her socks , I asked if there was anything else I could do for her . She shook her head no and smiled . All she wanted me to do was to listen . Each story is different . Some are detailed and others are simple . Some have a beginning , middle and end but others do n ' t have clear ends . Some are true but others not . Yet all those things do not really matter . What matters to the storyteller is that the story is heard - - without interruption or judgment . It was that woman who taught me the importance of stopping , sitting down and truly listening . And , not long after , in an unexpected accident , I became a patient . 20 years later , I sit all the time - - in a wheelchair . For as long as I could , I continued to see patients from my chair . I believe in the power of listening .", "questions": "What did the old woman think caused her health problems ?", "options": {"model": ["her son ' s not seeing her .", "her son ' s not having a family visit ."], "human": ["No one listening to her story .", "Her son ' s not seeing her ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
