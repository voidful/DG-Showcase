I say , \" I ' m going to miss you , \" and she gives me one of her looks and leaves the room . Another time I say , in a voice so friendly it surprises even me : \" Do you think you ' ll take your posters and pictures with you , or will you get new ones at college ? \" She answers , her voice filled with annoyance , \" How should I know ? \" My daughter is off with friends most of the time .
