{"id": "5577", "article": "The round - the - clock availability that cell phones have brought to people ' s lives may be _ amily life , a new study suggests . The study , which followed more than 1300 adults over 2 years , found that those who consistently used a mobile phone through out the study period were more likely to report negative \" spillover \" between work and home life - - and , in turn , less satisfaction with their family life . Spillover ( , ) actually means that the line between work and home began to become unclear . Work life may invade home life - - when a parent is taking job - related calls at home , for instance - - or family issues may start to take up work time . For example , a child may call Mom at work , telling her \" the microwave exploded \" , explained Noelle Chesley , an assistant professor of society at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee and the author of the study . The problem with cell phones seems to be they are allowing for ever more spillover between work and home . This may be especially true for working women , the study found . Among men , consistent use of mobile phones seemed not to allow more work issues to creep into family time . But for women , the spillover tended to go in both directions - - being \" connected \" means that work cuts into home time , and family issues come into work life . Cell phones seem to be opening more lines for stressful exchange among family members . But there may be ways to control the spillover , according to Chesley . Employers , she said , should look at their policies on contacting employees after working hours to make sure their expectations are \" reasonable \" . For their part , employees can decide that cell phones go off during family time , Chesley said .", "questions": "What is the main idea of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["men do n ' t like to use cell phones at home .", "women do n ' t need to use cell phones .", "cell phones get life and work mixed .", "how to control the pollution of cell phones ."], "human": ["Cell phones offer 24 - hour availability .", "Women do n ' t use cell phones in an effective way .", "Men are better at dealing with family problems .", "Cell phones get life and work mixed ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
