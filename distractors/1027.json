{"id": "1027", "article": "A serious problem for today ' s society is who should be responsible for our elderly and how to improve their lives . It is not only a financial problem but also a question of the system we want for our society . I would like to suggest several possible solutions to this problem . First , employers should take the responsibility for their retired employees . To make this possible , a percentage of profits should be set aside for this purpose . But when a company must take life - long responsibility for its employees , it may suffer from a commercial disadvantage due to higher employee costs . Another way of solving the problem is to return the responsibility to the individual . This means each person must save during his working years to pay for his years of retirement . This does not seem a very fair model since some people have enough trouble paying for their daily life without trying to earn extra to cover their retirement years . This means the government might have to step in to care for the poor . In addition , the government could take responsibility for the care of the elderly . This could be financed through government taxes to increase the level of pensions . Furthermore , some institutions should be created for senior citizens , which can help provide a comfortable life for them . Unfortunately , as the present situation in our country shows , this is not a truly _ answer . The government can seldom afford to care for the elderly , particularly when it is busy trying to care for the young . One further solution is that the government or social organizations establish some working places especially for the elderly where they are independent . To sum up , all these options have advantages and disadvantages . Therefore , it is reasonable to expect that some combination of these options may be needed to provide the care we hope to give to our elderly generations .", "questions": "What is the passage mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["the problem of the old .", "how we can improve the lives of the old ."], "human": ["The problems faced by the old in society .", "How we can improve the lives of the old ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
