{"id": "487", "article": "The view over a valley of a tiny village with thatched roof cottages around a church , a drive through a narrow village street lined with thatched cottages painted pink or white , the sight over the rolling hills of a pretty collection of thatched farm buildings - - these are still common sights in parts of England . Most people will agree that the thatched roof is an essential part of the attraction of the English countryside . Thatching is in fact the oldest of all the building crafts practised in the British Isles . Although thatch has always been used for cottage and farm buildings , it was once used for castles and churches , too . Thatching is a solitary craft , which often runs in families . The craft of thatching as it is practised toady has changed very little since the Middle Ages . Over 800 full - time thatchers are employed in England and Wales today , keeping and renewing the old roofs as well as thatching newer houses . Many property owners choose thatch not only for its beauty but because they know it will keep them cool in summer and warm in winter . In fact , if we look at developing countries , over half the world lives under thatch , but they all do it in different ways . People in developing countries are often unwilling to go back to traditional materials and would prefer modern buildings . However , they may lack the money to allow them to get the necessary materials . Their temporary mud huts with thatched roofs of wild grasses often only last six months . Thatch which has been done the British way lasts from twenty to sixty years , and is an effective defiance against the heat .", "questions": "People in developing countries also live under thatch because", "options": {"model": ["thatch has always been used for reserve", "there are many farm buildings in the world", "there are many houses in that area", "thatched roof houses are the cheapest"], "human": ["thatched cottages are a big tourist attraction", "thatch is an effective defense against the heat", "they like thatched houses better than other buildings", "thatched roof houses are the cheapest"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
