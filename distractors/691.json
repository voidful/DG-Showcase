{"id": "691", "article": "Cat has bright future By day he is just a normal cat but when the lights go out , he glows in the dark . Scientists have genetically modified a cat as part of an experiment that could lead to treatments for diseases . Named Mr . Green Genes , he looks like a sixmonthold cat but , under ultraviolet light , his eyes , gums and tongue glow green . That is the result of a genetic experiment at the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans , US . Mr . Green Genes is the first fluorescent cat in the US and probably the world , said Betsy Dresser , the center ' s director . The researchers made him so they could learn whether a gene could be introduced harmlessly into a cat ' s genetic sequence . If so , it would be the first step in a process that could lead to the development of ways to treat diseases via gene therapy . The gene , which was added to Mr . Green Genes ' DNA , has no effect on his health , Ms Dresser said . Cats are ideal for this project because their genetic makeup is similar to that of humans , said Dr Martha Gomez , a scientist at the center . To show that the gene went where it was supposed to go , the researchers settled on one that would glow . The gene \" is just a marker \" , said Leslie Lyons , an assistant professor at the University of California , Davis . Lyons is familiar with the center ' s work . \" The glowing part is the fun part , \" she said . Glowing creatures made international news earlier this month when the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists who had discovered the gene through their work with jellyfish .", "questions": "Which of the following might be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["a new gene", "a clever cat", "a glowing cat", "a clevel clevel cat"], "human": ["Mr Green Genes", "One Cat ' s Life", "An experiment on cats", "A Glowing Cat"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
