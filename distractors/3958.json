{"id": "3958", "article": "About a third of all common cancers in the United States , China and Britain could be prevented each year if people ate healthier food , drank less alcohol and exercised more , health experts said on Friday . Reports from the World Cancer Research Fund ( WCRF ) suggest that making simple lifestyle changes could prevent some 40 percent of breast cancers alone in Britain and the United States , as well as tens of thousands of stomach cancers . \" Even in 2011 , people are dying unnecessarily from cancers that could be prevented through keeping a healthy weight , diet , physical activity and other lifestyle factors , \" said a WCRF medical and scientific adviser . WCRF findings are supported by World Health Organization ( WHO ) reports , which say regular exercise can prevent many diseases such as cancers and heart diseases . Cancer is a leading cause of death around the world and its incidence is rising . Each year around 12 . 7 million people discover they have cancer and 7 . 6 million people die from some form of the disease . There are about 200 known types of cancer . Rachel Thompson , the WCRF ' s head of science , said that while the message was simple - - that not smoking , eating good food and being a healthy weight can help _ many cancers - - it was still a difficult one to get across . The WHO says adults should do at least 150 minutes of exercise a week . This could be done by walking for 30 minutes five times per week or by cycling to work every day . Peter Baldini , head of the World Lung Foundation , also called on all governments to introduce smoke - free laws and raise the price of cigarettes . Tobacco kills millions of smokers every year , and tobacco - related lung cancers also kill hundreds of thousands of people who do n ' t smoke but have been exposed to it second - hand . \" There is n ' t a magic bullet to cure all forms of cancer , but we have the opportunity and the duty to protect people from developing cancer wherever possible , \" Baldini said .", "questions": "Which of the following can be the best title of this text ?", "options": {"model": ["a new way to prevent cancers", "simple life changes could stop millions of cancers", "a new lifestyle change could prevent cancers", "a new way to cure cancer"], "human": ["Cancer is a leading cause of death", "Our bad lifestyle caused many diseases", "The incidence of common cancers is rising", "Simple life changes could stop millions of cancers"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
