{"id": "4366", "article": "Good morning , boys and girls . Today I ' ll talk about going online . We know that there are too many net bars around us . The Internet can make our lives interesting and enjoyable . Many of us like going online very much because we can learn how to use the computer and can get more information from the Internet . We can learn English . We can read some good newspapers and magazines . It can make us clever in playing computer games . We can send e - mails to our friends quickly . We can chat freely online with our friends . It can help us to get in touch with people from all over the world . But every coin has two sides . Net bars also bring us a lot of trouble . For example , some students spend too much time in playing computer games and some stay in the net bars all day and all night . Some girls even get to have boyfriends or some boys get to have girlfriends online . They write too many letters to each other . It takes them too much time to chat online , so they do worse and worse in their lessons and they do n ' t study well any more . I think we must n ' t get online when it is time for us to study . We can do it in summer or winter holidays or at the weekend . At the same time , if we have lots of free time , we can do some out - of - class activities at school . We usually have activities from4 ' 50 to 5 - 50 in the afternoon . We can play basketball or football on Monday or Thursday afternoon . We can join some interests groups in school , such as drawing or reading on Tuesday afternoon , or singing and dancing on Wednesday afternoon . We can go to the English Corner on Friday afternoon . We hope we can spend more time on our subjects or on such activities .", "questions": "If you are free on Tuesday afternoon , what out - of - class activities can you have at school ?", "options": {"model": ["play computer games .", "drawing or reading .", "playing computer games and writing ."], "human": ["Playing basketball or football .", "Going to the English Corner .", "Drawing or reading ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
