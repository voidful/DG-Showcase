{"id": "3512", "article": "Deborah Cohen is a senior natural scientist at the Rand Corp and the author of the book A Big Fat Crisis : The Hidden Forces Behind the Obesity Epidemic and How We Can End It . According to the book , there are lots of misunderstandings of obesity . 1 . If you ' re obese , blame your genes . Obesity rates have increased . Yet , between 1980 and 2000 , the number of Americans who are obese has doubled - - too quickly for genetic factors to be responsible . At restaurants , a dollar puts more calories on our plates than ever before , because restaurant meals usually have more calories than what we prepare at home , so people who eat out more frequently have higher rates of obesity than those who eat out less . 2 . If you ' re obese , you lack self - control . Research shows that if we are faced with too much information , we have a tendency to make poor dietary choices . Our world has become so rich in temptation that we can be led to consume too much in ways we ca n ' t understand . Even the most vigilant people may not be up to the task of controlling themselves . 3 . Lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables is responsible for obesity . Although the US Department of Agriculture estimates that fewer than 5 percent of Americans live in the \" food deserts \" , about 65 percent of the nation ' s population is overweight or obese . For most of us , obesity is not related to access to more fresh fruits and vegetables , but to the choices we make in supermarkets . 4 . The problem is not that we eat too much , but that we do n ' t exercise . Michelle Obama ' s \" Let ' s Move \" campaign is based on the idea that if kids exercise more , childhood obesity rates will decrease . But there was no significant decrease in physical activity levels as obesity rates climbed in the 1980s and 1990s . In fact , although a drop in work - related physical activity may account for up to 100 fewer calories burned , leisure physical activity appears to have increased . The problem is that we eat too much .", "questions": "What ' s the best title of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["obesity and health .", "the reasons why people are obesity .", "obesity is harmful to our health .", "four misunderstandings of obesity ."], "human": ["Four rules to help you avoid obesity .", "Obesity leads to a big fat crisis .", "Lacking self - control leads to obesity .", "Four misunderstandings of obesity ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
