Keep the conversations short , allow for questions and answer honestly . Prepare : Always be prepared , that is the best advice for children . For example , when preparing for bad weather , get the tools you need , like candles , radios , food , water and medicine . Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them , if ever needed .
