The Earth ' s crust is made up of rock called plates . As these plates move , they sometimes crash against each other , causing the crust to quake . In cities such as Tokyo , where small quakes happen quite often , many modern buildings are designed to be flexible so when the Earth moves , they move with it . Earthquakes can also break up gas and oil pipes . This can cause fires to break out , which can do as much damage as the earthquake itself .
