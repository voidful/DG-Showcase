{"id": "1395", "article": "William James , the great psychologist , said that most men are \" old fogies at twenty - five \" . He was right . Most men at twenty - five are satisfied with their jobs . They have closed their minds to all new ideas ; they have stopped to grow . The minute a man stops to grow - no matter what his years - that minute he begins to be old . On the other hand , the really great man never grows old . Goethe passed away at eighty - three , and finished his only a few years earlier ; Gladstone took up a new language when he was seventy . Laplace , the astronomer , was still at work when death caught up with him at seventy - eight . He died crying , \" What we know is nothing ; what we do not know is immense ( extremely large ) . \" And there you have the real answer to the question , \" When is a man old ? \" Laplace at seventy - eight died young . He was still unsatisfied , still sure that he had a lot to learn . As long as a man can keep himself in that attitude of mind , as long as he can look back on every year and say , \" I grew \" , he is still young . The minute he ceases ( stops ) to grow , the minute he says to himself , \" I know all that I need to know , \" - that day youth stops . He may be twenty - five or seventy - five ; it makes no difference . On that day he begins to be old .", "questions": "What do we know about Laplace ?", "options": {"model": ["he thought it was a waste of time to grow .", "he thought he had a lot to learn from .", "he was not pleased with what he had learned ."], "human": ["He thought he was one of the greatest man .", "He thought he was old when he was 25 .", "He was not pleased with what he had learned ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
