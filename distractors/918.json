{"id": "918", "article": "There ' s a case to be made , from things like Google search figures , that Robert Frost ' s poem The Road Not Taken - you know , the one about two paths diverging in a wood - is the most popular in modern history . Yet people still ca n ' t agree what it means . On the surface , it ' s a fridge - magnet cliche on the importance of taking risks and choosing the road less travelled . But many argue it slyly mocks that American belief in the individual ' s power to determine his or her future . After all , the poet admits that both paths look roughly similarly well - travelled . And how could he be sure he took the right one ? He ' ll never know where the other leads . Looking back at our life histories , we tell ourselves we faced important dilemmas and chose wisely . But maybe only because it ' s too awful to admit we ' re stumbling mapless among the trees , or that our choices do n ' t make much difference . Two psychologists , Karalyn Enz and Jennifer Talarico , throw light on these matters in a new study with a title that nods to Frost : Forks In The Road . They sought to clarify how people think about \" turning points \" versus \" transitions \" in life . A turning point , by their definition , is a moment that changes your future - deciding to leave a job or marriage , say - but often is n ' t visible from the outside , at least at first . \" Transitions \" involve big external changes : going to university , marrying , emigrating . Sometimes the two go together , as when you move to a new place and realize it ' s where you belong . ( \" New Yorkers are born all over the country , \" Delia Ephron said , \" and then they come to New York and it hits them : oh , that ' s who I am . \" ) But it ' s turning points we remember as most significant , Enz and Talarico conclude , whether or not they also involve transitions . The distinction is useful : it underlines how the most outwardly obvious life changes are n ' t always those with the biggest impact . Hence the famous \" focusing illusion \" , which describes how we exaggerate the importance of a single factor on happiness", "questions": "Why do some people think the poem makes fun of the American belief ?", "options": {"model": ["because the poet ' s attitude towards the two roads", "because the two roads are more or less similar in the poet ' s view ."], "human": ["Because Americans surely know which road to take without consideration .", "Because the two roads are more or less similar in the poet ' s view ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
