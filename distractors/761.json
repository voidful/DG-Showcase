{"id": "761", "article": "Based on new analysis , we are rapidly approaching major climate change and the effects on society and the environment could be quite severe . Geographers predict that within the next eighty years , current world climate zones could shift and some could completely disappear . Polar regions will get colder while tropical regions will get even hotter , forcing animals to migrate north . Climate changes like these could lead to the spread of diseases . Tropical storms and hurricanes will not only increase but may also become more intense . If the changes come too quickly , animal and plant species may not be able to adapt fast enough and could disappear . According to Science Daily , a new study predicts that by the year 2100 , many of today ' s familiar climates will be replaced by climates unknown in today ' s world . It is urgent that we reduce the risks of these far - reaching consequences for the whole world . The planet itself has been showing signs of change . In 2004 , a serious tsunami created by a major earthquake killed thousands in Sumatra and in 2008 , thousands died in China because of another severe earthquake . Egypt was hit in 2009 with a major earthquake and Haiti was _ in 2010 by yet another massive earthquake . Within just the last few months , new reports from around the world have been coming in and most agree that our climate situation is much worse than previously thought . At this point , it does n ' t matter what is causing it , but rather , what can be done about it . What ' s more , our world is getting more and more unstable every year . There is war and threat of war everywhere . Natural disasters are becoming more frequent and serious . However , other planets are experiencing global warming as well as our own and some scientists believe there may be some connection between this . No one knows anything for sure at this point because there is simply not enough data .", "questions": "What can be inferred from the Passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the climate change has nothing to do with the earth ' s climate .", "the planet itself has been showing signs of change for now .", "there will be no changes in the near future in the near future .", "the earth is not the only planet that is experiencing climate change ."], "human": ["Animals and plants wo n ' t die out as long as climate changes slowly .", "There ' s enough data for us to predict the future of climate change .", "The world is getting more unstable because of animal migration .", "The earth is not the only planet that is experiencing climate change ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
