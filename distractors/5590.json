{"id": "5590", "article": "Every one of us gets so used to punctuation marks that not many of us give them a secondthought . Actually , the ancient Greeks wrote this way . The lack of punctuation marks probably did n ' t bother good readers , though . As they read , they just put pauses where they fit best . Also at this time , sentences switched directions . A sentence read from leftto right . The next one read right to left , and then left to right again , etc . The ancient Romans sometimes punctuatedlike this : They put somethingthat can separate words in a sentence . The wordpunctuationactually comes from this idea andthe Latin word \" punctum \" which means a lot . When the 5th century arrived , there were just twopunctuation marks : spaces and points . The spaces separated words while the points showed pauses in reading . Then in the 13th century , a printer named Aldus Manutius tried to standardize punctuation . He always used a period for a complete stop at the end of a sentence . He used a slash ( / ) toindicate a short pause . Over time . that slash was shortened and curled , and it became the modern comma . Since that time , other marks have enlarged the punctuation family . The exclamation mark comes from the Latin word \" io \" . It means \" exclamation of joy \" . The question mark originally started out as the Latin word \" questio \" , meaning \" question \" . Eventually , scholars put it attheend of a sentence to show a question . Punctuation even keeps changing nowadays . New marks are coming into existence , and old punctuation marks are used in new ways . Take for example the \" interrobang \" . This 1962 invention combines the question mark and exclamation mark for times when writers want both . For example . \" She did what ? ! \" or \" How much did you pay for that dress ? ! \" Obviously , the interrobang is not widelyused or recognized yet , but its invention shows that English is not yet finishedwith its punctuation .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["the wordpunctuation marks have been used for the first one", "exclamation and question marks came from latin", "the latin word \" io \" has a history of more than two centuries"], "human": ["ancient Romans did n ' t use any punctuation marks", "spaces and slashes were already used before the 5th century", "exclamation and question marks came from Latin"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
