{"id": "2700", "article": "Many children have a \" bug period \" - - a time of life when bugs are a source of endless fascination and learning . Naturalist Edward O . Wilson jokes that unlike other kids , he never grew out of his bug period . Luckily for this biologist , his lifelong passion for ants has led to a career rich in accomplishments and praise . He is not just the world ' s foremost expert on the social behavior of ants , but also the receiver of the National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer Prizes for nonfiction . Now , at the age of 80 , Wilson has tried his hand at fiction . His first novel , Anthill , combines two of his greatest loves - - his childhood home , Alabama , and the ants that have been his lifelong friends . Described as a \" six - legged Iliad , \" Wilson ' s Anthill draws parallels between human and ant societies . Though there are no ant bands , secret police , or schools of philosophy , both ants and man conduct wars , divide themselves into specialized classes of workers , build cities , maintain infant nurseries and cemeteries , take slaves and practice agriculture , though ant societies are more energetic , selfless , and efficient than human ones . The book ' s first and third sections deal with the adventures of an Alabama boy , Raphael Semmes Cody , who goes by the name Raff . The boy grows up knocking around the Nokobee woods ; he ' s drawn to its natural wonders , and uses the forest to escape from his parents ' unhappy marriage . In the woods he leaves almost no stone unturned as he discovers the forest ' s rich flora and fauna . Raff grows up and heads to Harvard to study law , but returns later in life to protect the Nokobee from crazy developers . But fans of Wilson ' s science will be most interested in the book ' s middle section , where the author inserts a mini - novel describing the trials and sufferings of the ants living in the endangered forest . Reviews of the book have been mixed . Writing for The New York Review of Books , Margaret Atwood praised Wilson for his first novel , saying that it is highlighted by a diversity of ideas and an imaginative plot . And - - with the exception of some dull preachiness - - it is entertaining .", "questions": "Which of the following statement is TRUE according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the book ' s first novel has been published .", "anthill is set in the author ' s home state ."], "human": ["Wilson won two Pulitzer Prizes for fiction .", "Anthill is set in the author ' s home state ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
