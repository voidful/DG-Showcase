Each person sees the same scene , but each perceives something different about it . Perceiving goes on in our minds . Of the three people who look out the window , one may say that he sees a policeman giving a motorist a ticket . Another may say that he sees a rush - hour traffic jam at the intersection . The third may tell you that he sees a woman trying to cross the street with four children in tow . For perception is the minds ' interpretation of what the senses - - in this case our eyes - - tell us . Many psychologists today are working to try to determine just how a person experiences or perceives the world around him .
