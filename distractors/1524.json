{"id": "1524", "article": "The greatest recent social changes have been in the lives of women . During the twentieth century there has been a remarkable shortening of the proportion of a woman ' s life spent in caring for the children . A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties , and would be likely to have seven or eight children , four or five of whom lived till they were five years old . By the time the youngest was fifteen , the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years , during which health made it unusual for her to get paid work . Today women marry younger and have fewer children . Usually a woman ' s youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty - five years and can be expected to live another thirty - five years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty . Even while she has to take care of children , her work is lightened by modern living conditions . This important change in women ' s life - patterns has only recently begun to have its full effect on women ' s economic position . Even a few years ago most girls took a full - time job after they left school . However , when they married , they usually left work at once and never returned to it . Today the school - leaving age is sixteen ; many girls stay at school after that age , and though women usually marry older , more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born . Many more afterwards return to full - or - part - time work . Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage , with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfactions of family life , and with both husband and wife sharing more equally in providing the money , and running the home , according to the abilities and interests of each of them .", "questions": "Nowadays , a husband tends to", "options": {"model": ["help his wife by doing much of the housework", "stay at home after that age", "stay at home after leaving school at once"], "human": ["play a greater part in looking after the children", "take a part - time job so that he can help in the home", "help his wife by doing much of the housework"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
