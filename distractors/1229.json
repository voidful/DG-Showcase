{"id": "1229", "article": "The University of South Carolina has developed a sociology course dedicated to the life , work and rise to fame of pop star Lady Gaga . Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame is to be taught by Professor Mathieu Deflem , a fan of the singer . The course , which has its own blog , is due to start in spring 2011 . The Belgian born sociologist , whose research interests also include counter - terrorism , international policing , crime control and internet technology , says he has seen Lady Gaga in concert 30 times . \" We ' re going to look at Lady Gaga as a social event , \" Prof Deflem told the USC student newspaper , the Daily Gamecock . \" So it ' s not the person , and it ' s not the music . It ' s more this thing out there in society that has 10 million followers on Facebook and six million on Twitter . I mean , that ' s a social phenomenon . \" . It will look at business and marketing strategies , the role of old and new media , fans and live concerts , gay culture , religious and political themes , sex and sexuality , and the cities of New York and Hollywood , it says . Prof Deflem said he initially planned to call the course the Sociology of Fame or the Sociology of Celebrity , and to use Lady Gaga as an example . Also a fan of Frank Zappa , Prince , Led Zeppelin , Alice Cooper , Status Quo and Ritchie Blackmore , Prof Deflem says his interest in Lady Gaga began when he first saw her perform on television on 9 January 2009 . \" They do n ' t have to be hardcore fans . The better fan will not necessarily be the better student . But you have to have some interest in the topic . So if you really do n ' t like her , you probably should n ' t take the course . \"", "questions": "As a student of learning Lady Gaga , he or she should", "options": {"model": ["look at lady gaga as a social event", "be a real fan of the singer", "be interested in the topic"], "human": ["be loyal fan of Lady Gaga", "be a friend of Lady Gaga", "be interested in the topic"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
