{"id": "5702", "article": "Choosing the Right Resolution Millions of Americans began 2014 with the same resolution they started 2013 with , a goal of losing weight . However , setting weight loss as a goal is a mistake . To reach our goal of losing weight - - - the output , we need to control what we eat - - - the input ( ) . That is , we tend to care about the output but not to control the input . This is a bad way to construce goals . The alternative is to focus your resolution on the input . Instead of resolving to lose weight , try an actionable resolution : \" I ' ll stop having desert for lunch , \" or \" I ' ll walk every day for 20 minutes . \" Creating a goal that focuses on a well - specified input will likely be more effective than concentrating on the outcome . Recently a new science behind incentives , including in education , has been discussed . For example , researcher Roland Fryer wanted to see what works best in motivating children to do better in school . In some cases , he gave students incentives based on input , like reading certain books , while in others , the incentives were based on output , like results on exams . His main finding was that incentives increased achievement when based on input but had no effect on output . Fryer ' s conclusion was that the intensives for inputs might be more effective because do not knoe how to do better on exam , aside from general rules like \" study harder . \" Reading certain books , on the other hand , is a well - set task over which they have much more control . As long as you have direct control over your goal , you have a much higher chance of success . And it ' s easier to start again if you fail , because you know exactly what you need to do . If you want to cut down on your spending , a good goal would be making morning coffee at home instead of going to a cafe , for example . This is a well - specified action - based goal for which you can measure your success easily . Spending less money is n ' t a goal because it ' s too general . Similarly , if you want to spend more time with your family , do n ' t stop with this general wish .
