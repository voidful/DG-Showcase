Many students know that if they want to get ideal jobs with good salaries , they must do well in high school so they can enter good universities . Therefore , they spend all day studying without time to relax . However , not all students can go to top universities even if they work very hard .

As a result , students are forces to work harder and harder . Furthermore , there is pressure coming from students themselves . They realize they have a slim chance of getting into a top university as competition is fierce . So , they put a lot of stress on themselves and stay in a nervous state day after day . If they keep it up , they ' ll suffer illnesses ; both psychological and physical . What students need is relaxation . This does n ' t mean that they should give up their ambitions and stop studying hard . It means \" work while you work , play while you play \" .
