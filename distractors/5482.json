{"id": "5482", "article": "Soon after you have your first child , the question of having a second one is raised by friends and family . However , as the pattern of having two children in a family is challenged by modern family units , there are a few reasons why it is not selfish to want only one child . Today , the role of women has changed a lot . But nowadays , a wife has to help her husband earn the bread and butter as well as well as looking after her family . In demanding times like these , a woman has to put in more physical and emotional effort than any other member of the family . Raising a child comes at a cost that remains only heard of , until you find yourself paying it . The good reality of double income with no kids suddenly comes crashing down when there is a child involved in the picture . When one parent ( the mother ) needs to take some time off to look after the newborn , only one person becomes the earning member . Of course , the expenses went up rapidly . According to Susan Newman , PhD , a social psychologist , the average cost of raising a child is $ 227 , 000 from birth to college . Most young mothers also think that having one child would mean that there is more income for the child , and thus , better facilities can be provided . It is much easier to educate a single child at a good school , and give him / her better life with more resources at hand . With several children in the house , it becomes increasingly difficult to find ways to spend time with all of them . Dividing your time with just one child means that you can devote a little more time to doing the things you want to . In a single child unit , there are less comparison and more chances for positive motivation to learn new things . A happy child , who deserves the rightful attention , love , care , and time from both the parents , always gets a meaningful childhood , for both the parents and the child .", "questions": "Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage to support the writer ' s opinion ?", "options": {"model": ["less generation gap .", "more income for children ."], "human": ["better care .", "less generation gap ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
