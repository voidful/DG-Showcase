{"id": "1996", "article": "Bobby Moresco grew up in New York ' s Hell ' s Kitchen , a poor working - class neighborhood on Manhattan ' s West Side . But Hell ' s Kitchen lies right next door to Broadway , and the bright lights attracted Bobby from the time he was a teen . Being stage - struck was hardly what a street kid could admit to his partners . Fearing their making fun of him , he told no one , not even his girlfriend , when he started taking acting lessons at age 17 . If you were a kid from the neighborhood , you became a cop , construction worker , longshoreman or criminal . Not an actor . Moresco struggled to make that long walk a few blocks east . He studied acting , turned out for all the cattle calls - - and during the decade of the 1970s made a total of $ 2 , 000 . \" I was n ' t a good actor , but I had a driving need to do something different with my life , \" he says . He moved to Hollywood , where he drove a cab and worked as a waiter . \" My father said , ' Stop this craziness and get a job ; you have a wife and daughter . ' \" But Moresco kept working at his chosen career . Then in 1983 his younger brother Thomas was murdered in a killing . Moresco moved back to his old neighborhood and started writing as a way to explore the pain of Hell ' s Kitchen . Half - Deserted Streets , based on his brother ' s killing , opened at a small Off - Broadway theater in 1988 . A Hollywood producer saw it and asked him to work on a screenplay . His reputation grew , and he got enough assignments to move back to Hollywood .

The two worked on the writing Crash , but every studio in town turned it down . They kept trying . Studio executives , however , thought no one wanted to see hard lives in modern America .
