{"id": "1954", "article": "If you ' re like most students , you probably read both at home and outside your home : perhaps somewhere on your schoolyard and maybe even at work during your breaks . Your reading environment can have a great effect on your understanding , so give some thought to how you can create or choose the right reading environments . The right environment allows you to stay alert and to keep all of your attention on the text , especially when it is both interesting and difficult . When you ' re at home , you can usually create effective conditions for reading . You might want to choose a particular place - a desk or table , for example - where you always read . Make sure the place you choose is well lighted , and sit in a chair that requires you to sit straight . Reading in a chair that ' s too soft and comfortable is likely to make you sleepy ! Keep your active reading tools ( pens , markers , notebooks or paper ) and a dictionary close at hand . Before you sit down for a reading period , try to reduce all possible interruptions . Turn off your phone , the television , and the radio . Tell your family members or roommates that you ' ll be busy for a while . If necessary , put a \" Do not disturb \" sign on your door ! The more interruptions you must deal with while you read , the harder it will be to keep your attention on the task at hand .", "questions": "The author believes that the right reading environment", "options": {"model": ["helps readers improve their reading habits", "allows you to keep all of your attention on the text", "helps readers to be more active in reading", "helps readers a lot in their reading tasks"], "human": ["helps readers a little in their reading tasks", "can only be created at one ' s home", "can only be created outside one ' s home", "helps readers a lot in their reading tasks"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
