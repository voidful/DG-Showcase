In 1958 , a man named Godtfred created the plastic building bricks that can now be found in almost every child ' s toy box . The simple building block has become one of the most well - known and popular toys around the world . \" The Lego brick continues to be very attractive , because it allows children , and others , to develop their creativity and imagination , \" said Charlotte Simonsen , a spokeswoman of Lego . The company ' s building brick allows an endless number of links . With just two bricks there are 24 different links , and with six , there are 915 million possibilities , according to Lego . A half century after its creation , more than 400 million children and adults spend five billion hours a year putting the bricks together and pulling them apart . Also , the bricks made today can still link with those made in 1958 . Lego bricks are n ' t just child ' s play : they also attract the interest of adults . South Korean adventurer , Heo Young Ho , who climbed Mount Everest in 1987 , left a Lego toy behind in the snow during his climb . After its great success Lego experienced a serious crisis at the end of the 1990s , hit hard by competition from electronic games . Lego then suffered a dark period that lasted several years . With great efforts , the company began to be popular again , and in 2006 it earned about 1 . 5 billion dollars in 130 countries . Seven boxes of Lego are now sold every second around the world , and 19 billion bricks are produced each year : enough to encircle the Earth five times !", "questions": "The best title for this passage may be", "options": {"model": ["the importance of lego buildings", "the influence of lego", "the brilliant history of lego bricks", "the importance of the lego building bricks"], "human": ["Lego Bricks : Creativity and Imagination", "The Attraction of Lego Bricks", "Children and Lego Bricks", "The Brilliant History of Lego Bricks"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
