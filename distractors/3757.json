His wife had a natural delivery when she was 34 and their first child , a boy , is now 7 . The couple are now hoping to have a daughter through _ in the US . \" My wife could n ' t bear another delivery because of her heart condition and her age . Surrogacy helps avoid the risks to older mothers , \" Tang said , \" Moreover , our second child will be born in the US and become a citizen there . That is not a bad choice . \" The couple spent weeks researching their move , looking for a reliable agency that provides surrogacy services overseas . Surrogacy is still illegal in many countries , including China . \" We will be taking much higher risks by relying on a surrogate mother in China because we are not protected by any regulation or law . You pay a lot of money but may meet with many problems , \" Tang said . \" You might not even get your baby back . \" Tang and his wife are part of an increasing number of Chinese couples who are turning to surrogacy services . Tang also considered surrogacy in Thailand but dropped the idea after recent reports about a baby with Down Syndrome who was delivered through surrogacy and said to have been deserted in Thailand by the biological parents from Australia . Instead , Tang chose the California Surrogacy Center agency as his first option after reading the detailed introduction on its website . Compared with many other agencies that he could contact only via e - mail , the center has a consulting office in Beijing , Tang said . The center is in San Diego , California , and has satellite offices in Los Angeles and Beijing .
