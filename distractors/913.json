{"id": "913", "article": "The oddness of life in space never quite goes away . Here are some examples . First consider something as simple as sleep . Its position presents its own challenges . The main question is whether you want your arms inside or outside the sleeping bag . If you leave your arms out , they float free in zero gravity , often giving a sleeping astronaut the look of a funny balled dancer . \" I ' m an inside guy , \" Mike Hopkins says , who returned from a six - month tour on the International Space Station . \" I like to be wrapped up . \" On the station , the ordinary becomes strange . The exercise bike for the American astronauts has no handlebars . It also has no seat . With no gravity , it ' s just as easy to pedal violently . You can watch a movie while you pedal by floating a microcomputer anywhere you want . But station residents have to be careful about staying in one place too long . Without gravity to help circulate air , the carbon dioxide you exhale has a tendency to form an invisible cloud around you head . You can end up with what astronauts call a carbon - dioxide headache . Leroy Chiao , 54 , an American retired astronaut after four flights , describes what happens even before you float out of your seat , \" Your inner ear thinks your ' re falling . Meanwhile your eyes are telling you you ' re standing straight . That can be annoying - - that ' s why some people feel sick . \" Within a couple days - - truly terrible days for some - - astronauts ' brains learn to ignore the panicky signals from the inner ear , and space sickness disappears . Space travel can be so delightful but at the same time invisibly dangerous . For instance , astronauts lose bone mass . That ' s why exercise is considered so vital that National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) puts it right on the workday schedule . The focus on fitness is as much about science and the future as it is about keeping any individual astronauts return home , and , more importantly , how to maintain strength and fitness for the two and a half years or more that it would take to make a round - trip to Mars .", "questions": "One of the NASA ' s major concerns about astronauts is", "options": {"model": ["how they can remain healthy for long in space", "how to avoid staying in one place without gravity"], "human": ["how much exercise they do on the station", "how they can remain healthy for long in space"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
