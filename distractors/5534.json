{"id": "5534", "article": "A group of graduates , well established in their careers , were talking at a reunion and decided to visit their old university professor , now retired . During their visit , the conversation turned to complaints about stress in their work and lives . Offering his guests hot chocolate , the professor went into the kitchen and returned with a large pot of hot chocolate and other things including cups - porcelain , glass , crystal , some plain looking , some expensive , some elegant - - telling them to help themselves to the hot chocolate . When they all had a cup of hot chocolate in hand , the professor said : \" I notice that all the nice looking and expensive cups were taken , leaving behind the plain and cheap ones . While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves , that is the source of your problems and stress . The cup that you ' re drinking from adds nothing to the quality of the hot chocolate . In most cases it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink . What all of you really wanted was hot chocolate , not the cup ; but you consciously went for the best cups . . . And then you began eyeing each others cups . Now consider this : Life is the hot chocolate ; your job , money and position in society are the cups . They are just tools to hold and contain life . The cup you have does not define , nor change the quality of life you have . Sometimes , by concentrating only on the cup , we fail to enjoy the hot chocolate we have . The happiest people do n ' t have the best of everything . They just make the best of everything that they have . Live simply . Love generously . Care deeply . Speak kindly . Thank the Lord for your blessings in 2011 . And enjoy your hot chocolate in 2012 ! \"", "questions": "What is the purpose of the professor ' s words ?", "options": {"model": ["to wish them to be grateful to their life and make the best of everything that they have .", "to show that they are good at making the best of everything that they have .", "to wish them to be satisfied with their life .", "to tell them how to be satisfied with their life and life ."], "human": ["To tell them life is not easy , so try their best to be happy .", "To educate them that the happiest people do n ' t have the best of everything .", "To use different cups to tell them they should try different things in life .", "To wish them to be grateful to their life and make the best of everything that they have ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
