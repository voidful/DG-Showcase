But I know the truth about that . My mother found out from Troubled ' s mother . When Troubled ' s parents got an e - mail from Santa , saying that he would never bring Troubled another gift , they did n ' t want to tell him the truth . So now they buy presents and pretend they ' re from Santa . \" \" What did Troubled do to get Santa so mad ? \" Trogmire questioned . \" I think it had something to do with the time he put glue paper all over the living room floor on Christmas Eve , and left a sign that said , ' Trapped like a rat ! ' hanging over the fireplace . \" said Tremor . \" I guess Santa does n ' t have a sense of humour , \" sighed Trogmire . \" Well , at least I ' m not the only one who Santa scratched off his name list . \"", "questions": "Why does n ' t Santa leave presents for Trogmire or Troubled ?", "options": {"model": ["tremor does n ' t believe in santa .", "they have behaved badly .", "they do n ' t believe in santa claus ."], "human": ["Their parents wo n ' t let him leave gifts .", "He ca n ' t find their homes .", "They have behaved badly ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
