{"id": "157", "article": "A new study says that birds living in big cities sing shorter , faster songs that are higher - pitched than those sung by their brothers in the forests . The researchers think that the birds adjust their songs to allow themselves to be heard over the noises of the city , especially the low traffic noise . To study how urban birds song , Hans Slabbekoorn and Ardie den Bore , biologists at the University of Leiden in Netherlands , travelled around Europe and recorded bird songs in ten major cities and in nearby forests . The species they focused on , the great tit , is widespread across Eurasia and one of the few types of birds that _ in big cities . Singing is crucial for males , which use their songs to attract mates and mark out their territory . The changing songs could play a role in eventually causing the city birds and the forest dwellers to evolve into separate species . The findings could also help explain why usually only a few bird species thrive in cities . By contrast , many more bird species tend to be found in forests and other undeveloped habitats . Studies like this could eventually help researchers predict how urbanization will affect birds , using this knowledge could help urban planners design more pleasant city environments , study co - author Slabbe - koorn said . \" You can make a city much more livable if you pay attention to where the noise goes and where the people go , \" he said . \" It would be easy to fit the birds into those models . \" Then cities would n ' t be strictly for the people , but also for the birds .", "questions": "What is NOT the effect that studies of birds ' songs have ?", "options": {"model": ["protecting the birds from being killed .", "driving the urban birds back to the forest .", "challenging the birds ' s food for the people .", "protecting the birds from being kept in the forest ."], "human": ["Predicting how course of the city ' s expanding will affect birds .", "Helping the city planners design more pleasant city environments .", "Making cities more livable for both the birds and people .", "Driving the urban birds back to the forest ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
