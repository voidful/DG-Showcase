But in reality , the predators are under increasing threat from humans . Animal rights group PETA is hoping to use the popularity of the film to focus people ' s attention on the real life of Bengal tigers . With the rising demand for tiger parts from East Asia , illegal hunting remains a tremendous danger for the remaining cat population . Back in 1947 , there were 40 , 000 tigers in India , but the number is experiencing a sharp decline t0 1 , 706 despite campaigns to protect the animal . Rising man - animal conflict is also one of the leading causes of decline in tiger numbers . In one of numerous reported attacks on the endangered big cats , villagers near The Bangladesh - India border , armed with sticks and boat oars , set upon the animal suspected to have attacked a local fisherman and beat it to death earlier this month . So far this year , 58 tiger deaths have been reported in the country . \" The first instinct when a tiger is spotted is to just kill it , \" grieved Gurmeet Sapal , a wildlife filmmaker . \" The feeling of fear and revenge is so strong that it shuts out any other emotion . What we don ' t realize is that the tiger never attacks humans until it is forced to . \" ' India has been struggling to stop the tiger ' s decline in the face of the loss of habitat as well that encourages the animals to leave the forest for food . \" The tiger ' s rapidly exhausted prey base causes the predator to go al ! out to get its food . Consequently , livestock and human beings become easy prey , which leads inevitably to conflict , \" says a wildlife conservationist . Filmmaker Sapal says it is only normal for people to think of the tiger as a dangerous animal , but its image as a human killer bears some injustice . \" Tigers never kill for sport nor store meat . They kill their prey only in case of hunger . \"", "questions": "What contributes to the facts that livestock and human beings become easy target of tigers ?", "options": {"model": ["tigers are losing their habitat and forced to go out of the woods .", "it ' s easy for tigers to hunt for food rather than food for food .", "tigers are killing their predators only in case of hunger .", "it ' s easy for the tigers to hunt for food ."], "human": ["It is easier for tigers to hunt human beings than other animal for food .", "People hold a strong belief that tigers are a born threat to their lives .", "Tigers ca n ' t be treated equally as other animal in the forest", "Tigers are losing their habitat and forced to go out of the woods ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
