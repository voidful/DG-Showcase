{"id": "935", "article": "Modern society can not well do without the contribution that women can make in the professions and other kinds of work . There is a serious shortage of nurses and teachers , to mention only two of the occupations followed by women . It is a waste to give years of training at public expense only to have the qualified teacher or nurse marry after a year or two and be lost forever to her profession . The training , it is true , will help her in her duties as a mother , but if she continued to work , her service would be more widely useful . Many factories and shops , too , are largely staffed by women , many of them married . While here the question of training is not so important , industry and trade would be seriously short of staff if married women did not work . We can see then that there are good reasons for regarding it as desirable that married women should have some occupation outside the home . However , there are serious objections . Schools do not keep children occupied the whole day and school holidays are long . The mother ' s working day will almost certainly end well after the school day and her holiday will not begin at the same time as her children ' s . There will be therefore a period when children are not taken care of unless a substitute for the mother can be found , or unless it becomes more generally possible for women to work part - time . There seem to be some grounds for believing that there is more bad behavior among the children of working mothers than among those of mothers who stay at home , but more evidence is required before we can be certain of this . What we can be certain of , however , is that many more will continue to do so .", "questions": "According to the writer , women nurses and teachers ought to carry on their occupation after marriage because", "options": {"model": ["their training should not be wasted", "they do n ' t need to stay at home"], "human": ["they must still improve themselves as mothers", "their training should not be wasted"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
