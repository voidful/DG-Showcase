Anyone who has ever gone to high school or at least seen a John Hughes ' movie knows the answer to that question . When Theresa Sommers first discovered MySpace three years ago , the teen from Minneapolis , St . Paul thought she had found the real high school popularity contest . She could spend hours a day creating an online picture , finding cool pictures and music to make her page look more beautiful , and looking for interesting - looking people to be her online friends . And along the way , she could compete with her friends to see who had the most friends or most - visited page . The more she used the site , however , the less interested she became in only being popular ; she started using her time for more heartfelt conversations with friends and went more deeply into her personal interests . As a beginner in taking pictures , she put her best pictures on the site and looked for advice from people who are good at taking pictures . At the same time , she began to get in touch with the students of the colleges she wanted to go to . She opened up a new account on Facebook . And she even began to put some of her own creative writing on the website and would ask for advice on homework from her friends . She asked them , \" How long did you spend on your homework ? \" or \" How would you write it ? \" Often she would put her homework online .", "questions": "What ' s a John Hughes ' movies most probably about ?", "options": {"model": ["life of high school students .", "a school life of high school students ."], "human": ["How to make friends online .", "Life of high school students ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
