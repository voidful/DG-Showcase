{"id": "2184", "article": "Why are we addicted to upgrades ? According to Donald Norman , American author of the book The Design of Everyday Things , \" planned obsolescence \" is the trick behind the upgrading culture of today ' s consumer electronics industry . The New York Times cited Norman last month , saying that electronics manufactures strategically release new upgrades periodically , both for hardware and software , so that customers on every level feel the need to buy the newest version . \" This is an old - time trick - they ' re not inventing anything new , \" he said . Thomas Wensma , a Dutch designer , despises the \" planned obsolescence \" of companies , as recently reported by UK - based The Guardian . Wensma said this is a wasteful system through which companies - many of them producing personal electronics - release shoddy products simply because \" they know that , in six months or a year , they ' ll put out a new one \" . But the new psychology of consumers is part of this system , as Wensma said to the newspaper : \" We now want something new , something pretty , the next shiny thing . \" _ \" It ' s to the damage of the consumer and the environment , \" as the New York Times quoted Norman . \" But perhaps to the betterment of the stockholder . \" In its most recent fiscal year , Apple ' s profit margin was more than 21 percent , reported the Los Angeles Times . At Hewlett - Packard , the world ' s biggest PC manufacturer , it was only 7 percent . \" Steven Jobs pushed the principle of ' planned obsolescence ' to new heights , \" the newspaper commented on the company ' s profits and marketing strategy . \" Apple ' s annual upgrades of its products generate sales of millions of units as owners of one year ' s MacBook or iPhone line up to buy the newest version , even when the changes are incremental . \" Peer pressure As to Li Jijia , the need for upgrading his smart phone comes mainly from friends and classmates . When the majority of friends are switching to the latest devices , he worries about feeling left out . \" Some apps and games require better hardware", "questions": "The writer takes the example of Li Jijia to show that", "options": {"model": ["the new psychology of consumers is the best way to solve the problem of the problem of the problem", "the new psychology of consumers is the best way to solve the problems of the new psychology of consumers", "the new psychology of consumers is more important than the new psychology of consumers", "the new psychology of consumers is also to blame for the wasteful system"], "human": ["young people are always fond of something new , pretty and shiny", "if you do n ' t upgrade your smart phone , you will lose contact with your friends", "needs of consumers help to promote the development of electronics industry", "the new psychology of consumers is also to blame for the wasteful system"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
