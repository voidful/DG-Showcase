{"id": "1738", "article": "Millions of years ago dinosaurs lived on the earth . In the days of dinosaurs the whole earth was warm and wet . There were green forests and they could find enough to eat . Later , parts of the earth became cold and dry . and the forests there died . Then dinosaurs could not find enough to cat . This must be one reason why dinosaurs died out . We can guess another reason . New kinds of animals came on the earth . Some had big brains and were fast and strong . They could kill dinosaurs . There may be other reasons that we do n ' t know about yet . Scientists are trying to make more discoveries about dinosaurs . Dinosaurs were of many sizes and shapes . Some were as small as chickens , while some were about 90 feet long . There were also terrible fights between dinosaurs . They might have happened more than 100 million years ago . Though there was no man to see any of the fights , we can be told by the animal ' s footprints that fight did take place .", "questions": ".
