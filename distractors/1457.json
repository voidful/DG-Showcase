Air pollution kills more than three million people a year worldwide and leads to health problems like lung and heart disease and strokes , according to a 2016 research project in the journalNature . It is also linked to brain disease , mental illness and diabetes . Andreas Bilstein at Bitop believed that the inhaler could be useful around the world , because air pollution is not just a European problem : \" Especially in Asia - China in particular - the demand for such a product is even higher . \" Many Chinese cities have been suffering from haze . According to World Health Organization , two of the 10 most polluted cities in the world in 2015 were in China . About 800 , 000 deaths that are linked to air pollution take place in the country every year . However , such inhalers should never be an excuse for not trying to stop air pollution , said Professor Jean Krutmann at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine . \" The best thing is that we have clean air and we do n ' t need any prophylactic treatment , \" he said .", "questions": "What is the new inhaler ?", "options": {"model": ["it can help us stop air pollution .", "it can help us to protect ourselves from the dirty air .", "it can help us reduce the harm of air pollution ."], "human": ["It can solve the air pollution problem .", "It can make the dirty air clean .", "It can help us reduce the harm of air pollution ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
