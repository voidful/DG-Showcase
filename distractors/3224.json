{"id": "3224", "article": "The Cuban iguana is a species of lizard of the iguana family . It is the largest of the West Indian rock iguanas , one of the most endangered groups of lizards . This species with red eyes and a thick tail is one of the largest lizards in the Caribbean . The Cuban iguana is mainly _ : 95 % of its diet consists of the leaves , flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species , including the seaside rock bush and various grasses . However , Cuban iguanas occasionally eat animal matter , and individuals have been watched eating the dead flesh of birds , fish and crabs . The researchers wrote that quite a few people on Isla Magueyes could have caused this incident . The Cuban iguana is living throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islands with a wild population growing rapidly on Isla Magueyes , Puerto Rico . It is also found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac , where a separate subspecies occurs . Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites half destroyed by Cuban crocodiles . To avoid the attack from them , the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly - pear cacti . In general the species is decreasing , more quickly on the mainland than on the outlying islands . One of the reasons for their decrease is habitat destruction caused by the over consuming of farm animals , housing development , and the building of tourist resorts on the beaches where the animals prefer to build their nests . Although the wild population is decreasing , the numbers of iguanas have been sharply increased as a result of captive - breeding and other protection programs .", "questions": "What ' s the writer ' s purpose of writing the text ?", "options": {"model": ["to show the cuban iguana is endangered .", "to call on us to protect the endangered lizard .", "to give us a brief introduction to the cuban iguana ."], "human": ["To show he is concerned about the Cuban iguana .", "To explain reasons for the Cuban iguana ' s decrease .", "To give us a brief introduction to the Cuban iguana ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
