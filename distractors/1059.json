{"id": "1059", "article": "The name England comes from the words \" Angle land \" . The Angles were people who came from northern Germany in the 5th and 6th centuries , after the Romans had left . The French name for England is Angleterre , which also means \" Angle land \" . There were also invasions of southern England by Saxons and Jutes ( people from another part of northern Germany ) . English people are sometimes called AngloSaxons . The Celts who used to live in this area were forced to move back into Scotland , Ireland , Cornwall and into Western France ( the area known as Brittany ) . England at first became a series of kingdoms , the strongest of which was Wessex ( the name comes from WestSaxon ) . The names of many of the areas in England come from this period - - for example , the name Sussex comes from SouthSaxon , Essex from EastSaxon , and East Anglia from EastAngle . The Vikings then came from Denmark , and later the Normans invaded from France . Eventually England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland were united , forming the United Kingdom . The English language is the main language spoken throughout England , although there are many different accents . It can be difficult to know how to spell or to pronounce some English words , because the language has been influenced by Latin and Greek ( languages used at the time of the Romans , and used in religion and education until recent times ) , German ( the language of the Angles , Saxons and Jutes ) , French ( the language of the Normans ) , Gaelic / Scots ( Celtic languages ) and Danish ( the language of the Vikings ) . There are now many people throughout the United Kingdom who speak a foreign language either as their first or second language ; mainly due to immigration from Europe or the Commonwealth ( countries which used to be part of the British Empire ) .", "questions": "Why do many people in the UK speak a foreign language nowadays ?", "options": {"model": ["because they used to be part of the british empire .", "because they have moved from other countries ."], "human": ["Because they are required to learn a foreign language at school .", "Because they have moved from other countries ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
