{"id": "2731", "article": "While parents , particularly mothers , have always been attached to their infants . societal conditions frequently made this attachment difficult to maintain . First of all , the high infant death rate in the premodern times meant that such attachments often ended in hopelessness . Perhaps to prevent the sadness that infant death caused , a number of societal practices developed which worked against early attachment of mother and child . One of these premodern attachment discouraging practices was to leave infants unnamed until they had survived into the second year . Another practice that discouraged maternal attachment was tightly wrapping infants . Wrapping effectively prevented the close physical interactions like stroking and kissing that are so much a part of modern mothers ' and fathers ' affection for their infants . A third practice which had the same distancing effect was wet - nursing . Breast - feeding was not popular among the well - to - do in the early modern times ; infants were often fed by wet nurses hired for the purpose . In some places , such as nineteenth - century prefix = st1 / France , city infants were sent to wet nurses in the country . Often a wet nurse would feed her own child first , leaving little milk for the city infant - who , in many cases , died . In Rouen , the death rate for children sent to a wet nurse was 35 percent", "questions": "Babies were unnamed until they were two so that", "options": {"model": ["their parents would not be too sad if they died", "their mother and child would not die"], "human": ["maternal attachment could be maintained", "their parents would not be too sad if they died"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
