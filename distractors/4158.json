{"id": "4158", "article": "We may know that there are four basic stages that human beings pass through when they enter and live in a new culture . This process , which helps us to deal with culture shock , is the way our head and our personality react to ( . . . ) the strange new things we meet with when we move from one culture to another . Culture begins with the \" honeymoon stage \" . This is the time when we first arrive in which everything about the new culture is strange and exciting . We see new things , hear new sounds and language , eat new kinds of food . This stage can last for quite a long time because we feel we are very excited . Unluckily , the second stage can be more difficult . After we have got used to our new life , we can become very tired and begin to miss our homeland and our family , friends , pets . All the little problems in life seem to be much bigger and more disturbing when you face them in a foreign culture . This time of cultural adjustment can be very difficult and lead to pulling away from the new culture . The third stage is called the \" adjustment stage \" . This is when you begin to realize that things are not so bad in the host culture . Your sense of humor usually becomes stronger and you realize that you are becoming stronger by learning to take care of yourself in the new place . Things are still difficult , but you are now a survivor ! The fourth stage can be called \" at ease at last \" . Now you feel quite comfortable in your new place . You can deal with most problems that you have . You may still have problems with the language , but you know you are strong enough to deal with them . There is a fifth stage of culture shock which many people do n ' t know about . This is called \" reverse culture shock \" . Surprisingly , this happens when you go back to your own culture and find that you have changed and that things there have changed while you have been away . Now you feel a little uncomfortable back home .
