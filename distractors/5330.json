If I stayed for a year , I still would n ' t remember . \" Hiroshi , from Japan , ca n ' t understand why British people keep their shoes on at home . \" If a visitor kept his shoes on at home in Japan , we ' d think he was very rude or very dirty . I also ca n ' t understand why British people do n ' t wash before getting into the bath . They wash themselves in the bath , in their own dirty water ! I would n ' t feel clean if I had a bath in that way . \" Cecila Vargas , from Spain , noticed that \" strange \" way British people greet each other . \" They seem to be afraid of touching each other . When they meet , they just smile and look embarrassed ! If I did n ' t kiss or hug my friends in Spain , they ' d be very surprised . We always greet each other like that . It ' s perfectly normal . \" Roberto , Grazzi , from Italy , could n ' t understand why British people queue so much . \" At a bus stop or in a post office , they always stand in a line - - - even if there is only one other person !
