At the same time , it is fine to allow for a snack break and also to allow for stretching breaks . Also , you should remember that it is your duty to do your homework . Next time , when you want to depend on Mom and Dad for help , please try to find the answer yourself , because you will learn much , much more that way . When you have a question , especially something about a science or math , do n ' t always turn to your teacher ! It is a good idea to try to find the answer yourself . If this does n ' t work , you can also look at the materials in the back of the book . They may guide you to the pages you should look at to help you understand the problem . Finally , while doing homework , do n ' t think about or do other things . Keep working . Setting a time limit often helps with this . Different ages decide different amounts of time . 10 - 15 minutes is good for a child that ' s aged 6 - 8 . A time of 20 - 30 minutes is about right for a child aged 9 - 12 .
