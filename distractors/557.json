{"id": "557", "article": "You want to know about my staying in America , right ? Well , to tell you the truth , it is really an eye - opening experience to study here . In China , I had English classes five times a week since fifth grade . However , I did n ' t know how different textbook English could be from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School , Connecticut . When I first studied English , I was told to say , \" I am fine \" when people say \" How are you ? \" But in the US , I found that people say , \" I am good \" or \" I ' m tired \" . One day , someone greeted me with \" What ' s up ? \" It made me _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I did n ' t know what to say . Since then , I have discovered more and more differences between Chinese and US cultures . To my surprise , US girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun to get a tan . However , in China , girls try every possible way to get their skin paler , or \" whiter \" . I was also surprised by how hardworking US students are . In China , schoolwork is almost everything , so we study hard and that ' s it . But here , a \" good \" student gets good grades , does a lot of work for the public and plays sports or music . The kids here are so talented , I am starting to be sorry that I gave up playing the piano at an early age and that I have never thought about sports .", "questions": "Which of the following is NOT true ?", "options": {"model": ["american girls love to have white skin .", "chinese students do n ' t have good grades in school ."], "human": ["US students are talented and hard working .", "American girls love to have white skin ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
