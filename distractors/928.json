{"id": "928", "article": "The British usually expect one or two snowfalls each year but the amount of snow rarely affects everyday life . However , this week Britain has had the worst snow it has seen in around 18 years . Some places had more than 30 cm in a day . The bad weather caused severe disruption . More than 3000 schools had to close as teachers and pupils were unable to get to school . School children were n ' t too unhappy about it though as they headed out to play the snow , building snowmen , having snowball fights , sledging and some even snowboarding and skiing . In London , bus services were withdrawn for a day and tubes and trains were cancelled . Major motorways in the country had to close . Many people were unable to get to work and it is thought the cost of this lost labor is around & 1 billion ( 10 billion yuan ) to businesses and the economy . Anyone who wanted to leave the country had problems too . Runways were closed at all the UK ' s major airports because of the amount of snow . Hundreds of flights were cancelled leaving some passengers stranded at airports . So why is the UK so ill - prepared for snow ? The mayor of London , Boris Johnson , explained that there are n ' t enough snow - ploughs and gritters and it does n ' t make sense to buy such equipment when it snows so infrequently . The south - east of England was the hardest hit at the beginning of the week but the snow is now moving northwards where the chaos continues . More ice and snow is forecast throughout the week and the advice from travel and weather organizations is to stay indoors unless you really need to _ !", "questions": "What can we infer from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["british people do n ' t like to go to work because of the heavy snow .", "british people do n ' t like the snow in britain .", "the heavy snow has been a very rare heavy one in the uk for 18 years .", "most of the people in the uk do n ' t care about the coming snow ."], "human": ["The heavy snow is what the British have been expecting for 18 years .", "The heavy snow does n ' t please school children at all .", "The government is n ' t ill - prepared for snow .", "The heavy snow has been a very rare heavy one in the UK for 18 years ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
