Recently the Obama administration is considering disabling cell phones in cars , aiming to out down cell - phone - related road deaths . Transportation Secretaryy Ray LaHood , the nation ' s anti - distracted - driving supporter , said in an interview on November 18 that federal officials are looking at technology to disable cell phones inside cars . \" I think it will be done , \" LaHood said . \" I think the technology is there and 1 think you ' re going to see the technology become adaptable in automobiles to disable these cell phones . We need to do a lot more if we were going to save lives . \" Also on Thursday , the transportation government started a new \" Faces of Distracted Driving \" video campaign that features people who have been killed or lost their loved ones because of inattentive drivers . The video features heartbreaking stories of children killed in crashes because of phoning or text messaging , and new videos are expected to be added every few weeks . A driver is four times more likely to crash while using a mobile phone . More than 5 , 500 people were killed last year by distracted drivers , and another 500 , 000 were injured . LaHood has said it is never safe to talk on a cell phone while driving , hands - free or not , because it can really cause distraction . Incidentally , a lot of people seem to agree with this viewpoint - - a new research shows nearly two - thirds of Americans support a national ban on the use of cell phones while driving , even if the driver is using a hands - free device . But the research did n ' t ask how people feel about government - issued mobile phone scramblers or other disabling devices .", "questions": "We can infer from the text that", "options": {"model": ["disabling devices will be widely used in cars", "the writer does n ' t agree with the idea of using cell phones while driving", "the writer is not sure whether disabling devices will be accepted by the drivers", "the writer does n ' t agree with the idea of disabling devices"], "human": ["most people realize the harmfulncss of distracted driving", "most people would like to choose hands - free devices while driving", "the disabling devices in cars will be widely used if it is free", "the writer is not sure whether disabling devices will be accepted by the drivers"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
