Up until now , I had been old enough to dress myself , but today would need some help . Miss Finlayson , my kindergarten teacher , had been through brst snow days many times , but I think she may still remember this one . I managed to get into my wool snow trousers . But I struggled won my jacket because it did n ' t fit well . It was a hand - mc - down from my brother , and if made me wonder why I had to wear his ugly clothes , At least my hat and scarf were mine , and they were quite pretty . Finally it was time to have Miss Finlayson help me with my boots . In her calm , motherly voice she said , \" By the end of winter , you will all be able to put on your own boots . \" I did n ' t realize at the at the time that this was more a statement of hope than of confidence . I handed her my boots and stuck out my foot . Like most children , I expected grown - ups to do all the work . After much pushing , she managed to get first one into place and then , with a sigh , worked the second one on too . I announced , \" They ' re on the wrong feet . \" She struggled to get the boots off and went through the joyless task of putting them on again . \" They ' re my brother ' s boots , you know , \" I said . \" I hate them \" . Somehow , from long years of practice , she managed to act as though I was n ' t an annoying little girl , She struggle with me , she asked , \" Now , where are your mittens ? \" I looked into her eyes and said , \" I did n ' t want to lose them , so I hid them in the toes of my boots .", "questions": "Why does the author Miss Finlayson would remember that first snow day ?", "options": {"model": ["because the little girl did n ' t want to go through the joyless task .", "because it was the first snow of winter .", "because the little girl played a trick on her .", "because the little girl did n ' t like her new boots ."], "human": ["Because the little girl was in her brother ' s clothes .", "Because it was the most exciting day of the winter .", "Because the little girl wore a pretty scarf .", "Because the little girl played a trick on her ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
