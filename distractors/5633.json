{"id": "5633", "article": "Alaska ' s Arctic lakes now freeze later and melt earlier in the year than in 1950 , leaving them easy to suffer water loss from evaporation and possibly adding to local warming , a new study finds . The winter ice season near Barrow , Alaska , is shorter than in 1950 , researchers reported Jan . 30 in the journal The Cryosphere . Lake ice is also thinner each winter . The scientists surveyed 402 lakes on the North Slope , where permafrost ( permanently frozen ground ) and shallow lakes dominate the areA . In 2011 , the lake ice was 38 percent thinner than in 1950 , and 22 percent fewer lakes froze through to their bottoms . \" When we saw the actual numbers we were shocked at how dramatic the change has been , \" lead study author Cristina Surdu , of the University of Waterloo in Canada , said in a statement . Surdu and her co - authors analyzed the changes in lake - - ice thickness and ice cover with satellite images and climate model simulations ( satellite images are only available from 1991 ) . The climate models suggest the Arctic lakes froze almost six days later and broke up about 18 days earlier in the winter of 2011 compared with the winter of 1950 . \" The changes in ice and the shortened winter affect Northern communities that depend on ice roads to transport goods , \" Surdu saiD . For example , every winter , oil companies build roads over frozen lakes to carry supplies to Prudhoe Bay . \" The dramatic changes in lake ice may also contribute to further warming of the entire region , because open water on lakes contributes to warmer air temperatures , \" Surdu saiD . The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet , for reasons that may include its layered atmosphere , which traps heat , and the loss of sea ice and snow cover , which help reflect the sun ' s energy when present .", "questions": "According to the text , the great changes of Alaska ' s Arctic lakes", "options": {"model": ["reflect the sun ' s energy when present", "are totally beyond surdu ' s expectations"], "human": ["come as no surprise to Surdu and her co - authors", "are totally beyond Surdu ' s expectations"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
