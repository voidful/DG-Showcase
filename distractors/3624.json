A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition found organic crops have up to 60 percent more antioxidants than non - organic crops . But critics claim there is still no evidence that organic food is a healthier option . Amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables , the government is at pains to stress that families should not waste their money on organic food . Just 30 percent of people meet the recommendation to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day . Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said , \" Organic products provide a useful extension of consumer choice , but it is worth emphasizing that , nutritionally , they are no better and no worse than conventional products . The only benefit of organic farming was enjoyed by birds , insects , mammals and plants . \" \" It is up to the consumers to decide how they spend their money on their fruit and vegetables . There are many reasons why an individual might wish to choose organic products but nutritional benefit should not be one of them , \" she added . Chief Executive Helen Browning said , \" We know that people choose organic food because they believe it is better for them , also well as for wildlife , animal welfare and the environment , and this research backs up what people think about organic food . \"", "questions": "According to Baroness Jolly ,", "options": {"model": ["organic products are better than traditional products", "organic foods contain less harmful effects", "organic products are better than non - organic products", "organic products ca n ' t provide better nutrition"], "human": ["organic products are better that common food", "people should be urged to buy organic products", "organic foods are good for environment protection", "organic products ca n ' t provide better nutrition"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
