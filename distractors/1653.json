{"id": "1653", "article": "As an English teacher , one of the most common problems I ' ve found with my students is their lack of confidence with speaking , and difficulty in understanding native speakers . Another problem could be that a foreign language taught in schools can sound quite different to what native speakers actually use . There are a few English words and expressions that I ' d never heard until I came to China . The most common one in my experience is \" How are you ? I ' m fine , thank you , and you ? \" I appreciate that although this greeting is much too formal for everyday use - it ' s easy to learn and helps build confidence . However , it can be a hard habit to break . I ' ve seen many parents correct their kids if they do n ' t use that exact phrase , as if simply replying \" I ' m fine \" would somehow be rude . In fact I ' m banning my students from saying that in the classroom , insisting a simple \" I ' m fine , thanks \" is good enough . \" Seldom \" is another one that I find interesting . The first time a student told me \" I seldom watch TV \" , my initial reaction was a stupefied look , followed by \" Huh ? \" I then realized the student used \" seldom \" when it ' s more common for us to use \" rarely . \" I was just as confused when I first heard a toilet referred to as a WC ( water closet ) , another English term I ' d never heard of back in Australia . Of course , my students know the other names for it like bathroom , toilet , washroom etc . so to prefer that name is an interesting choice . I do n ' t mind that my students have substituted familiar English words with their own , far from it . It reminds me how creative they can be with not only their language , but with mine as well . It ' s healthy for English to evolve and change and I ' m happy to add these new words to my vocabulary . One important lesson I ' ve learnt is that textbooks can only help you so much . For further improvement you ' d better practice with native speakers .", "questions": "The problem with the reply \" I ' m fine , thank you , and you ? \" is that it is", "options": {"model": ["not easy to learn with native speakers", "not popular with native speakers"], "human": ["considered impolite by native speakers", "not popular with native speakers"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
