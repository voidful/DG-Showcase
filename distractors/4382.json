{"id": "4382", "article": "Dear new moms , You should teach your children manners as soon as your children can understand what you ' re saying . When your children do something right , let them know . When your children do something wrong , tell them how they should do it and why . Here are some basic manners for children : 1 . Wait for their turn and do n ' t _ other people when they are speaking . Tell them to wait until someone finishes speaking , and then ask questions . 2 . Always greet the people who come over to your house . You can teach your children to shake hands with grown - ups who come over , but it ' s not necessary to shake hands with other children . Your children should always say \" hello \" or \" hi \" when someone comes to your home so that the guest feels welcome . 3 . Say \" please \" and \" Thank you \" often . And say \" You ' re welcome \" to answer others ' \" Thank you \" . 4 . After playing a game , no matter what the result is , be pleased . If your children win , tell them not to show off , but to be kind . If they lose , tell them not to get mad and tell the other children that they did a good job or speak well of them . Yours Dr .
