{"id": "2888", "article": "The candidate longing for election to the highest office in the United States must be native - born American citizen who is at least 35 years old and who has lived in the United States for at least 14 years . The election course is complicated , and the road to the Oval Office is long . Potential candidates must present papers stating their intention to seek their party ' s recommendation ; delegates then choose from among those running some months later at the national conferences . Before that , however , each state holds a primary election that determines how the state ' s voters want the party ' s delegates to vote . Methods of choosing the delegates vary from state to state . At the conferences , there are speeches and often heated discussions . It may take several rounds of voting before delegates can agree on a candidate . On the final day of the meeting , the presidential candidate announces his or her choice for vice president . Election Day , by law , is the Tuesday that follows the first Monday in November . On this day , registered voters may cast their votes for president , vice president , and candidates for other federal , state , and local offices . The popular vote , however , does not determine who will be president . The president is chosen by a vote of the Electoral College , a group of 538 citizens from the 50 states and the District of Columbia who are chosen to cast votes for the president and vice president . The rules for choosing electors , as with the delegates , vary . Each state also decides whether its electoral votes must reflect the popular vote . The number of electors in each state is determined by the number of representatives and senators that a state sends to Congress and , therefore , may change every 10 years , depending on the results of the United States census . The winner must get at least 270 of the electoral votes when the Electoral College meets in December of the election year . The election results are not official , however , until the following January , when Congress meets in a joint conference to count the electoral votes . At the end of the road to the Oval Office is the swearing - in ceremony , at which the new or reelected president takes the oath of office on January 20 .", "questions": "We can conclude from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["there is nothing wrong with the election course", "the presidents of the united states are theoretically picked by the citizens directly", "there is nothing wrong with the government ' s way to the entrance office in the united states", "there is nothing wrong with the government ' s way of making election"], "human": ["the candidate who wins the popular vote will be the winner of the election", "the electors do n ' t have the right to vote against their registered voters ' will", "the change of a state ' s population barely has effect on the presidential election", "the presidents of the United States are theoretically picked by the citizens directly"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
