{"id": "4078", "article": "We can see waste everywhere in the school . Some students ask for more food than they can eat and others often forget to turn off the lights when they leave the classroom . They say they can afford these things . But I do n ' t agree with them . Waste can bring a lot of problems . Although China is rich in some resources , we are short of others , for example , fresh water . It is reported that we will have no coal or oil to use in 100 years . So if we go on wasting our resources , what can we use in the future and where can we move ? Think about it . I think we should say no to the students who waste things every day . Everybody should stop wasting as soon as possible . In our everyday life , we can do many things to prevent waste from happening , for example , turn off the water taps when we finish washing , turn off the lights when we leave the classroom , try not to order more food than we need and so on . Little by little , we will change everything . We can stop waste one day , if we do our best .", "questions": "Which is the best title of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["stop wasting", "the importance of waste"], "human": ["Waste in the School", "Stop Wasting"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
