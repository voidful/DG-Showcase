They also had two libraries with 3 , 000 books , excellent maps , scientific instruments , musical instruments and a new invention : a camera . Franklin and his men left Engand on May 19th , 1845 and they sailed without problems across the Atlantic towards Canada . When Franklin arrived at Baffin Bay in July 1845 , things were going very well for the expedition . On July 26th , some sailors saw Franklin ' s ships when they were entering the bay . That was the last time that anyone saw Franklin and his men alive . The British government became very worried when they heard nothing from Framklin . They sent expeditions to 1ook for him , but the expeditions all returned without any news . The government offered PS20 , 000 to anybody who could help Franklin or anybody who had information about Frailklin . Nobody came with information . Then , in August 1850 some sailors found the first signs of the Franklin Expedition while they were searching on Devon Island : some old food tins , some papers , and , something very strange , the graves of three men . The men all died in January 1846 while Franklin was waiting in Baffin Bay for the ice to melt . But why did they die ? The three men were all young and three deaths in the first months of the expedition were very strange . What happened to them ? And where were the ships and all the other sailors ? The mystery of the Franklin Expedition was growing stronger . . .", "questions": "At last the first signs of the Franklin Expedition were found", "options": {"model": ["on the coast of the atlantic", "in august 1850 on devon island", "on the atlantic island", "only on the island on the atlantic"], "human": ["in January 1846 near Baffin Bay", "on May 19th , 1845 near Baffin Bay", "in January 1846 on Devon Bay", "in August 1850 on Devon Island"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
