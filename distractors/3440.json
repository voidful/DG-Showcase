Well , it happens every day to high schoolers . Just because some students have stolen things in shops , all of us are treated like _ Even though I ' d never steal , store employees looked at me like I ' m some kind of hardened criminal mastermind . For example , during one lunch period , my friend Denny and I went to the Grab \" n \" Go on Tuesday . We arrived to find a line of students waiting outside .

Not only were we considered to be shoplifters , but brilliant , greedy shoplifters . The Grab \" n \" Go is n ' t an isolated case . Earlier this year , a department store worker told me to leave my backpack at the front of the store . When I asked who was going to keep an eye on my stuff , she said , \" Do n ' t worry . It is n ' t going anywhere . \" In other words , I had to risk losing my stuff so that the store would n ' t have to risk losing theirs . \" Do n ' t worry , \" I replied , \" I do n ' t need to shop here . \" The most annoying thing , though , is the way employees watch my friends and me . It ' s almost strange and frightening . Once , at a drug store , I went down an aisle and found a guy standing on a box , stocking the shelves . He was watching my hands , which were empty . He got down off his box and rushed off , as if he was going to get the store manger . How crazy is that ? You know , _ . I work at the CD Crib , and every day I see adults commit a terrible crime .
