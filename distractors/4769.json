Wars and traffic accidents can leave people with terrible physical and mental _ Often they appear again in dreams . Now American researchers think they are close to developing a pill , which will help people forget bad memories . The pill is designed to be taken immediately after a frightening experience . They hope it might reduce , or possibly erase the effect of sad memories . In November , some scientists tested a drug on people in the US and France . The drug stops the body producing chemicals that fix memories in the brain . So far the research has suggested that only the mental effects of memories may be reduced , not that the memories are erased . The research has caused plenty of argument . Some think it is a bad idea , while others support it . Supporters say it could lead to pills that prevent or treat soldiers ' troubling memories after war . They say that there are many people who suffer from terrible memories . \" Some memories can destroy people ' s lives . They come back to you when you do n ' t want to have them in a dream . They usually come with very sad feeling . \" said Roger Pitman , a scientist of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School . \" This could relieve a lot of that suffering . \" But those who are against the research say that it is very dangerous to change memories because memories give us our identity . They also help us all get away from the mistakes of the past . \" All of us can think of bad events in our lives that were terrible at the time but make us who we are . I ' m not sure we want to erase those memories , \" said Rebecca Dresser .", "questions": "The drug tested on people can", "options": {"model": ["prevent body producing certain chemicals", "help people to remember bad memories", "stop people from remembering bad experiences", "make people who do n ' t want to suffer from bad memories"], "human": ["cause the brain to fix memories", "stop people remembering their experiences", "erase the emotional effects of memories", "prevent body producing certain chemicals"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
