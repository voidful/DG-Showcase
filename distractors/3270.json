{"id": "3270", "article": "Over the years I ' ve been teaching my grandchildren about a simple but powerful concept - - the ant philosophy . I think everybody should study ants . They have an amazing four - part philosophy , and here is the first part : Ants never quit . If they ' re headed somewhere and you try to stop them , they ' ll look for another way . They ' ll climb over , or around . They keep looking for another way to get where they ' re supposed to go . What a great philosophy . Second , ants think summer all winter . That ' s an important perspective . You ca n ' t be so childish as to think summer will last forever . So ants are gathering their winter food in the middle of summer . The third part of the ant philosophy is that ants think winter all summer . That is so significant . During the winter ants remind themselves , \" This wo n ' t last long ; we ' ll soon be out of here . \" And on the first warm day , the ants are out . If it turns cold again , they ' ll dive back down , but then they come out on the first warm day . They ca n ' t wait to get out . And here ' s the last part of the ant philosophy . How much will an ant gather during the summer to prepare for the winter ? All he possibly can . What an incredible philosophy , the \" all - you - possibly - can \" philosophy . Wow , what a great lecture to attend - - the ant seminar !", "questions": "Which of the following might be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["ants ' ts", "ants ' expects", "the ant philosophy", "the ants"], "human": ["The Ant Life", "The Ant Teamwork", "The Ant University", "The Ant Philosophy"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
