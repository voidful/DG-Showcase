{"id": "2800", "article": "Remind children that bad things do n ' t last . It may sound simple , but the message is extremely important . \" Children often do n ' t have the experience to know that when something bad happens - - - they lose an important game or their best friend lets them down - - - it ' s not the end of the world , \" explains Nancy Leffert , a senior research scientist with the Research Institute , an American adolescents and children ' s research group . \" They think their bad feelings will last for ever , or that one failure will ruin everything . \" Unfortunately , that kind of thinking discourages motivation . \" If a child believes that the cause of her upset is lasting , or that nothing she does will make a difference , it decreases her ability to keep on trying . \" says Dorothy Rich , president of the MegaSkills Education Center of the Home and School Institute , based in Washington . Any time you can help your child see that a situation is not lasting , that a result can be changed , or that one opinion does not reflect reality , you give her reason to hope . Case in point : \" When my daughter Kathy was eight , art was one of her favorite subjects , \" says Beth , a mother of two . \" Then she got an art teacher who gave a great deal of praise to one student and barely noticed the rest . Kathy was ready to give up until I explained to her , \" Never stop doing your best just because one person does n ' t give you praise . \" Beth had to repeat the advice often , and finally her daughter got the message . \" Kathy is 12 now , and art is still one of her strongest subjects . \"", "questions": "Which of the following is RIGHT about Nancy Leffert ?", "options": {"model": ["she is concerned about children ' s attitudes towards failure .", "she thinks highly of children ' s attitude .", "she does n ' t believe the reason why children do n ' t have the experience to know how to avoid mistakes ."], "human": ["She strongly believes that bad things wo n ' t last long .", "She is the director of the Research Institute .", "She is concerned about children ' s attitudes towards failure ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
