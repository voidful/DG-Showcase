{"id": "300", "article": "The accident at Lake Sherwood was in our backyard . An SUV had gone off the road , down a hill , and collided with a tree . When we heard the wreck , I remembered to say \" call 911 \" . My family was the first on the scene . Nick , my son , was on the cell phone with 911 . He saw a friend who was a victim in the crash who was a 15 years old girl who was badly disfigured and had died instantly . It was a terrible scene . There had been six people in the truck , all between 15 and 17 years old . My husband and I checked all the victims , and I picked one who was conscious and stayed with him . I talked with him and had him lay on the ground . When I asked him if he was hurt , he said he was sore all over . When help arrived , they asked me to stay and continue working with them . I did as Debbie Romine , . my instructor , said in class , and did what they wanted . They even said thank you before they left . The sheriff deputies came by Saturday night to get our statements and play the 911 tape back , so Nick could identify all the voices in the background . They said over and over that the way he handled the call was the best they had heard in a long time . He was calm and worked with them even when he saw his friend who had died . The Sheriff ' s Department is sending some people over to help us work through our emotions . The first aid and CPR course I took in January really helped me . I just did n ' t expect to put it to good use so soon . Pennyd .
