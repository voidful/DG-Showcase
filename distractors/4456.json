It took me hours to get there and I drove round and round looking for a place to park my car . At last I found a place in a back street .

Making my way rapidly along the street , I could not help thinking that it was much easier to walk than to drive . At noon , I left my friend ' s office . It suddenly stuck me that I had no idea where I had parked my car . Walking down street after street , I examined each car closely and was greatly relaxed to see a small green car just behind an old truck .
