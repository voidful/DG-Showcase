{"id": "428", "article": "Chicago is considering firm measures to prevent the Asian carp , a giant fish native to the Far East , from coming into North America ' s Great Lakes in large numbers . Such a move could cost up to $ 18bn , a heavy economic burden to the city . This species , more than a metre in length , was originally introduced to southern US states three decades ago to control weeds in sewage treatment plants . But they escaped into the Mississippi River and increased in number quickly , making their way north towards the Great Lakes and threatening the native fish species along the way . \" Dozens of them will often leap out of the water as boats approach . ' ' Michael Beecham , a local environmental expert , described how frightening the scene was . \" I ' ve gone down the river and seen these fish jump up and hit me in the face . It is a big problem for our native species , \" he said . A meeting has been organized to find a technological solution to the carp problem , one of which involves blocking parts of Chicago ' s canal system . Listening at the meeting was John Goss , who was worried about the effect that having barriers in the canal system would have on industry . \" It would certainly increase the cost of transportation , \" he told . \" It is currently very cheap and efficient to bring materials and finished goods down the Chicago ship canal . ' ' Another cheaper option is to eat the fish out of existence . Dirk Fucik is selling carp burger at his fish shop not far from downtown Chicago . He thinks the carps are a great resource . \" To catch it and throw it away is a waste , \" he says . \" Eating them helps solve the problem and also provides jobs . \" But the idea has not yet caught on . So far , he is the only person in Chicago selling carp burgers .", "questions": "In John Goss ' s point of view , the building of barriers", "options": {"model": ["may lead to the increasing cost of industrial products", "is a waste of money to solve the problem", "is a waste of money to solve the problem of the carp problem"], "human": ["can force the Asian carp out of the Great Lakes", "will help the canal system work more efficiently", "may lead to the increasing cost of industrial products"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
