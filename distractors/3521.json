{"id": "3521", "article": "I was driving home one evening at about 5 , caught in traffic , and the car started to die - - I hardly managed to get into a gas station , glad only that I would have a warm spot to wait for the tow truck . Before I could make the call , I saw a woman walking out of the \" Quickie Mart \" building , then suddenly she slipped on some ice and fell down , so I got out to see if she was okay . When I got there , it looked like she had been overcome by weep than that she had fallen ; she was a young woman who looked _ with dark circles under her eyes . She dropped something as I helped her up , and I picked it up and gave it to her . It was a coin . At that moment , everything came into focus for me : the crying woman , the ancient Suburban packed full of stuff and three kids in the back , and the gas pump reading $ 4 . 95 . I asked her if she was okay and if she needed help , and she just kept saying \" I do n ' t want my kids to see me crying , \" so we stood at the other side of the pump from her car . She said she was driving to California for Christmas and that things were very hard for her right now . I took out my credit card and swiped it through the card reader on the pump so that she could fill up her car completely , and I bought two big bags of food for her kids in the car who attacked it like wolves . While it was fueling , she asked , \" So , are you an angel or something ? \" I said , \" At this time of year , angels are really busy , so sometimes God uses common people . \" It was unbelievable to be part of someone else ' s miracle . And of course , you guessed it , when I got in my car it started right away and got me home with no problem . Sometimes , angels fly close enough to you that you can hear the flutter of their wings .", "questions": "The young woman cried because", "options": {"model": ["she did n ' t want to see her", "her situation was very terrible"], "human": ["she fell down and got injured", "her situation was very terrible"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
