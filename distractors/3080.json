In order to shop at the store , he needed to put money into the shopping cart to use it . Annoyed that he had to \" pay to shop , \" Lasn jammed the coin into the cart so that it would n ' t work . It was an act of _ - - the first of many - - for Lasn . Born in Estonia , Kalle Lasn moved to Australia as a young man and then later to Japan , where he founded a marketing research firm in Tokyo . Eventually , Lasn moved to Canada and for several years produced documentaries for public television . In the late 1980s , Lasn made an advertisement that spoke out against the logging industry and the deforestation going on in the Pacific Northwest . When he tried to show his ad on TV , though , no station in this area would give him airtime . In response , Lasn and a colleague founded Adbusters Media Foundation , a company for the \" Human right to communicate . Adbusters produces magazine , newspaper , and TV ads with a social message . Many use humor and irony to make their points : In one , for example , a man chain smokes a brand of cigarettes called \" Hope \" . In another , a child is dressed in an outfit used in fast - food ads . Next to the child is a note from its mother telling the restaurant to leave her child alone . Adbusters also has a magazine and a web site , the Culture Jammers Network , whose members include students , artists , and activists as well as educators and businesspeople interested in social change . Many of these \" culture jammers \" are working to raise awareness about different social issues by hosting events like \" Buy Nothing Day \" , \" No Car Day \" and \" TV Turnoff Week \" .
