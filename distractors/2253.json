{"id": "2253", "article": "Two years ago , the Funk family of suburban Chicago adopted a Chinese baby girl who had been abandoned on a sidewalk near a Yangzhou textile factory . Last year and halfway across the United States , the Ramirez family of suburban Miami adopted a girl who had been abandoned a week later on the same spot . Both families named their daughters Mia . It turns out , a first name and Chinese heritage are n ' t the only things the three - year - olds have in common . The girls ' mothers - - Holly Funk and Diana Ramirez - - met on a website for parents who had gone through international adoptions . After a flurry of e - mails comparing photographs and biographical details , DNA testing proved the families ' suspicions : The girls are probably fraternal twins . \" I was in shock , \" said Ramirez , who lives with her husband Carlos in Pembroke Pines , Florida . \" Well , now this is for real . \" The Internet and Web groups revolving around international orphanages are increasingly being used to link adopted children with biological kin . The site that the Funks and Ramirezes used has a membership of 137 people , with 15 sets of twins and seven sets of siblings whose relationships have been confirmed . At a reunion on Friday at Chicago ' s O ' Hare International Airport , Mia Diamond Funk Mia Hanying Ramirez shyly surveyed each other , then reached for each other ' s hand . DNA tests established an 85 percent probability that the girls are at least half sisters . Scientists did not have a biological parent to test and reach a greater certainty , but given their ages and physical similarities , experts say it is likely they are fraternal twins . Douglas and Holly Funk hope to take Mia to Miami in October . Both sets of parents say they are committed to staying in touch and often let the twins talk to each other on the phone .", "questions": ".
