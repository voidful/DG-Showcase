{"id": "654", "article": "I passed all the other courses that I took at my university , but I could have never passed botany . This was because all botany students had to spend several hours a week in a laboratory looking through a microscope at plant cells , and I could never once see a cell through a microscope . This used to make my professor angry . He would wander around the laboratory pleased with the progress all the students were making in drawing the structure of flower cells , until he came to me . I would just be standing there . \" I ca n ' t see anything , \" I would say . He would begin patiently enough , explaining how anybody can see through a microscope , but he would always end up angrily , claiming that I could too see through a microscope but just pretended that I could n ' t . \" It takes away from the beauty of flowers anyway . \" I used to tell him . \" We are not concerned with beauty in this course , \" he would say . \" We are concerned with the structure of flowers . \" \" Well , \" I ' d say . \" I ca n ' t see anything . \" \" Try it just once again , \" he ' d say , and I would put my eye to the microscope and see nothing at all , except now and again something unclear and milky . \" You were supposed to see a clear , moving plant cells shaped like clocks . \" \" I see what looks like a lot of milk . \" I would tell him . This , he claimed , was the result of my not having adjusted the microscope properly , so he would readjust it for me , or rather , for himself . And I would look again and see milk . I failed to pass botany that year , and had to wait a year and try again , or I could n ' t graduate . The next term the same professor was eager to explain cell - structure again to his classes . \" Well , \" he said to me , happily , \" we ' re going to see cells this time , are n ' t we ? \" \" Yes , sir , \" I said . Students to the right of me and to the left of me and in front of me were seeing cells ; what ' s more ,", "questions": "Why could n ' t the writer see the flower cells through the microscope ?", "options": {"model": ["because he did n ' t have to pay attention to the plant cells", "because he could n ' t see anything at all", "because he was not able to adjust the microscope properly"], "human": ["Because the microscope did n ' t work properly", "Because he was just playing jokes on his professor by pretending not to have seen it", "Because he was not able to adjust the microscope properly"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
