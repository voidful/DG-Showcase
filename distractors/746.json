About 45 percent of children suffer passive smoking in families , 50 percent in public places , and almost 6 percent on public transportation , shows a research released by the Shanghai Children ' s Medical Center on Tuesday . \" Not only adults but also children and newborn babies are at risk for the adverse effects of passive smoking , \" said Tang Jingyan , a doctor at the Shanghai Children ' s Medical Center . \" Actually , those young children whose bodies are still growing and developing are more sensitive to the effects of secondhand smoke . \" Research has shown that children who are exposed to secondhand smoke will suffer from more colds , coughs and sore throats , and they are more likely to suffer from bronchitis , pneumonia and will have a higher risk of developing cancer . Doctors even suggested that children suffering passive smoking are more likely to have behavioral problems and may not develop mentally as quickly as their peers . Other research by the Shanghai Children ' s Medical Center has found that more than 80 percent of child patients in the center live in a smoke - filled household , where one or both parents smoke . \" Though doctors have stressed the harm of passive smoking over and over , it is still hard to reach a totally ' smoke free ' home , \" said a pediatrician named Zhang Yiwen , noting that parents are often tempted to smoke even though they have learned the harmful effects of secondhand smoke . China has 540 million people suffering from passive smoke , 180 million of them younger than 15 . The age of smokers is also getting lower , earlier reports said . \" There are more young smokers than before . You can see young people wearing a school uniform and carrying a schoolbag light a cigarette on the street . Some of them are even female students , \" said Jing Xingming , a professor of children ' s developmental behavior at the center . \" Children like to imitate adults , especially their parents . If parents often smoke at home , it is very likely children will develop a smoking habit , which can cause a vicious circle , \" Jin said .
