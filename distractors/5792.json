What is the sun ? The sun is a star . The stars we can see have their own light . There are many big stars we can not see . Their light had burned out . Others are still bright , but they are so far away that we can not see them . The sun looks bigger and much brighter than other stars because it is the nearest of all stars . The sun and the other stars we see are very hot , but the air around us saves us from the heat of the sun . The sun gives us light and warmth . It makes plants grow and turns leaves green .
