{"id": "518", "article": "There are no days when men and women could n ' t associate with each other . When we are asked if boys and girls can associate with each other , most of us will say , \" Yes , of course . Why not ? \" If we want to deal with the association between boys and girls properly , here are some tips for you to follow . 1 ) Keep a normal and healthy state of mind . Our schools and classes are made up of boys and girls . It is very natural for the boys and girls to contact each other and build up the friendship with the students of the other sex . Generally speaking , we should broaden the circle of the association . We should make as many friends as possible . We should have more friends of the other sex instead of one or two . We should contact the students in public , not in secret . 2 ) Contact students of the other sex warmly , generously and sincerely . Do n ' t be too nervous or too shy in contact with a person of the other sex , because no one likes a person who is too shy to say a word . 3 ) Don ' t fall into the ditch of early love . The boys and the girls at adolescence are rich in feelings and full of imagination . They are easy to regard the friendship as a sign of love and fall in love with each other at an early age . In my opinion , early love is a green apple that ca n ' t be eaten . An apple wo n ' t taste sweet until it is fully ripe . Do keep out of early love .", "questions": "The main idea of the passage is to", "options": {"model": ["explain why we should make friends with the boys and girls", "give some advice on how to associate between boys and girls", "tell us that we should make friends with the boys and girls", "tell boys how to make friends with girls"], "human": ["tell students to keep away from early love", "say contacts does good not only to boys but also to girls", "teach boys how to talk with girls", "give some advice on how to associate between boys and girls"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
