{"id": "3050", "article": "\" It hurts me more than you \" , and \" This is for your own good \" - - these are the statements my mother used to make years ago when I had to learn Latin , clean my room , stay home and do homework . That was before we entered _ in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school . The schools and the educators made it easy for us . They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let - alone policy . We stopped making our children do homework . We gave them calculators , turned on the television , left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation . Now teachers , faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years , are realizing we ' ve made a terrible mistake . One such teacher is Sharon Klompus who says of her students \" so passive \" and wonders what has happened . Nothing is demanded of them , she believes . Television , says Klompus , contributes to children ' s passivity . \" We ' re talking about a generation of kids who ' ve never been hurt or hungry . They have learned somebody will always do it for them , instead of saying ' go and look it up ' , you tell them the answer . It takes greater energy to say no to a kid . \" Yes , it does . It takes energy and it takes work . It ' s time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work . It ' s time to take the car away , to turn the TV off , to tell them it hurts you more than them but it ' s for their own good . It ' s time to start telling them no again .", "questions": "What is the main idea of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["parents should allow their children to do homework .", "it ' s time to be stricter with our kids .", "parents should set a good example to their children ."], "human": ["Parents should leave their kids alone", "Parents should set a good example to their kids .", "It ' s time to be stricter with our kids ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
