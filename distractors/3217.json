{"id": "3217", "article": "Searching the Internet may help middle - aged and older adults keep their memories sharp , US researchers said . Researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles , studied people doing web searches by recording their brain activity . \" What we saw was people who had Internet experience used more of their brain during the search , \" Dr . Gary Small , a UCLA expert on aging , said , \" This suggests that just searching on the Internet may train the brain and that it may keep it active and healthy . \" \" This is the first time anyone has simulated an Internet search task while scanning the brain , \" Small said . His team studied 24 normal volunteers between the ages of 55 and 76 . Half were experienced at searching the Internet and the other half had no web experience . However , the two groups were similar in age , gender and education . Both groups were asked to do Internet searches and book reading tasks while their brain activity was monitored . \" We found that in the book reading task , the visual cortex - - the part of the brain that controls reading and language - - was activated , \" Small said , \" In doing the Internet search task , there was much greater activity , but only in the Internet - savvy group . \" He said it appears that people who are familiar with the Internet can engage in much deeper level of brain activity . Activities that keep the brain engaged can preserve brain health and thinking ability . Small thinks learning to do Internet searches may be one of those activities .", "questions": "Which of the following is TRUE ?", "options": {"model": ["internet search can improve people ' s ability of reading and thinking", "internet searches can preserve brain health and thinking ability", "internet search is the most activity for middle - aged adults", "internet search is a way of reading and language ."], "human": ["When you read , the whole brain will be activated .", "Dr .
