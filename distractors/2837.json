{"id": "2837", "article": "Everything that humans hear is in the form of waves . Just as the eye sees light waves in the form of color1s , the ear hears sound waves in the form of noises . The ear and the eye turn these different waves into signals that the brain can make sense of . The ears and brain have an amazing ability to recognize particular sounds . For example , a mother often can tell when her baby is crying even if there are other crying babies in the same room . This is because the sound of her baby ' s cry has special meaning to her and the brain has recorded its importance . The ability to recognize sounds improves with experiences . As the brain receives information about sounds from day to day , it stores the information in its memory . When the brain hears new sounds , it gives meaning to them based on the information already in the memory . This is why certain words or songs can make a person happy . Often it is not the words or songs themselves that cause this feeling . The sounds are connected to happy memories for that person . Another hearing process controlled by the brain is to decide where a sound is coming from . One ear is usually closer to the source of a sound than the other ear is . Sound waves are stronger when they reach the ear that is closer . They also reach the closer ear first . The brain recognizes these differences and uses them to decide the location of the source of the sound .", "questions": "Why does a person feel happy when they hear some songs ?", "options": {"model": ["because there are different sounds .", "because there are different sounds in that person ' s brain .", "because the sounds are connected to happy memories .", "because the certain sounds are connected to happy memories for that person ."], "human": ["Because certain words or songs can make a person happy .", "Because a person has the ability to recognize the sounds", "Because the person feel the song is special", "Because the certain sounds are connected to happy memories for that person ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
