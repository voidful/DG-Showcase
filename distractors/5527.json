{"id": "5527", "article": "Scholarship Application Tips in 2014 for college students * Before you apply 1 . Work hard to get good grades . Do n ' t sweat about one bad grade , but always strive to do your best . 2 . Get involved , and stay involved , in extracurricular activities . Sports , clubs , drama , bands and orchestras - these often count toward a student ' s overall scholarship application evaluation . The same goes for paid ( or unpaid ) work experience . 3 . Begin your scholarship research early - by your sophomore or junior year of high school , if possible . Make special note of application deadlines , as they can vary from late summer to late spring . 4 . Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for - several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money . * During the application process 1 . Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program ' s focus ( community service , subject interest ) . Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind . 2 . Answer questions as they are asked . Do n ' t go off the topic . 3 . If there is a financial component to the application , make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility . 4 . Take your time . Write down everything you can think of for each question , then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off . 5 . Do n ' t wait until the last minute to complete your application , especially if you are applying online . Computer systems can get clogged with the large volume of applicants hoping to submit their qualifications during the last few days and hours before a deadline . 6 . If a third party has to complete part of your application , such as providing a letter of recommendation , make sure you ask them early on and remind them as often as necessary to ensure they provide you with the necessary materials . 7 . Last but not least , review your application with your parents to make sure you have n ' t left out any important details . Good luck to the students applying for the 2014 scholarship programs !", "questions": "Before you apply for a scholarship , it ' s best to", "options": {"model": ["start your application by yourself", "write a letter of application before the end", "begin your preparation as early as possible"], "human": ["pay more attention to grades than to extracurricular activities", "focus on only one scholarship application", "begin your preparation as early as possible"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
