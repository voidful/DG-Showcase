{"id": "2881", "article": "A Korean wave is sweeping across China , with many Chinese women worshipping South Korean actors Kim Soo Hyun and Lee Min Ho as demigods . Chinese netizens have always been divided over South Korean TV dramas , but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China . And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star , the South Korean TV series which is on the air now . Top South Korean actors Jun Ji - hyun and Kim Soo Hyun recently earned a popularity rating of 24 . 8 percent in their country , considered strong by Nielsen Korea . You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia . Besides , the book , The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane , read by the hero in You Who Came From The Star was a hard - to - get item on Amazon for a while . The two TV programs have several common elements : a tall , handsome , and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her , and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman . Both programs portray the purity of love , which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug . Perhaps that ' s the secret of their success ; perhaps people are still fascinated by Cinderella - type stories . The growing wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China , and the challenges that young people face in their search for a better life might have prompted many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich , caring men . This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV dramas portray . In fact , South Korean TV dramas are tailored to meet the market ' s demands . In contrast , Chinese TV screens are flooded by knock - off or poorly made soap operas . There are too many Chinese TV dramas that are either of the stereotyped war theme or just blindly copy foreign programs . The lack of good stories has resulted in loads of TV series on time travel or fights in the harems of Qing Dynastyemperors . These , in short , are the pain of Chinese TV productions . The shooting for South Korean productions generally starts when the scripts are just one - third ready .", "questions": "The main point the author emphasizes in this passage is", "options": {"model": ["why chinese tv dramas are more popular than chinese tv dramas", "why chinese tv dramas are more popular", "what modern tv dramas need is not copying foreign programs but innovation", "south korean tv series are more popular than other tv series"], "human": ["why Korean actors are more popular than Chinese actors", "how the three Korean actors became famous around East Asia", "the Cinderella - type stories are an ever - lasting theme people are fascinated with", "what modern TV dramas need is not copying foreign programs but innovation"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
