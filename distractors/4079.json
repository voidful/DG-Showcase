{"id": "4079", "article": "Much has been said and written recently about heroes , mainly because many people think we have too few of them . There are many different kinds of heroes , but they all seem to have two things in common . First , heroes , by their actions , show the great possibilities of human nature . Second , heroes can also stand the test of time , and their achievements will not be easily forgotten . Because of these good points , we need to choose our heroes carefully . Olympic sports star Jackie Joyner - Kersee , who is believed to be a hero , warns young people to be careful of making athletes heroes . She hopes that if someone tries to copy her , it will be because she has achieved her goals by working hard . Joyner - Kersee says that a hero should be someone who has an influence on another person ' s life . Poet Maya Angelou believes that a hero encourages people to treat others well and to be concerned about the greater good . A hero should show politeness , courage , patience , and strength all the time . A hero should encourage others to follow him with actions that improve the world , even if only in small ways . Author Daniel Boorstin suggests that , \" _ are people who make news , but heroes are people who make history . \" Thus , if a person is truly worthy to be called a hero , he or she will not be soon forgotten . We all need heroes . We need to be able to respect people who have been there , done that , and succeeded . Many times the greatest heroes are the people we deal with every day - - relatives , friends , and neighbors - - who will keep going when it is easier to give up . The parent who puts her or his family ahead of herself or himself , the teacher who will make more money at another job but chooses to help others - - all these people can be considered as heroes . A hero quietly and continuously sets a good example , an example that inspires others to follow .", "questions": "Joyner - Kersee hopes that young people", "options": {"model": ["will be better prepared for heroes", "will work hard"], "human": ["will become heroes", "will work hard"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
