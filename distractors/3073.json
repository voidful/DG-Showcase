{"id": "3073", "article": "If you put all the books you own on the street outside your house , you might expect them to disappear immediately . But one man , Hernando Guanlao in Manila , tried it and found that his collections grew . He ' s a lovely man in his early 60s , with one ever - lasting love - - books . They ' re his pride and joy , because , whether he likes it or not , they seem to be taking over his house . Guanlao has set up a \" library \" outside his home in central Manila . Readers can take as many books as they want , for as long as they want . As Guanlao says , \" The only rule is that there are no rules . \" You might consider it would end very quickly . But in fact , in the 12 years he ' s been running his library . He ' s found that his collection has grown rather than become smaller , as more and more people help the activity . \" It seems to me that the books are speaking to me , \" he says with a smile , \" The books are telling me they want to be read . \" Guanlao started his library in 2000 , shortly after the death of his parents . He was looking for something to honor their memory , and that was when he hit upon the idea of promoting the reading habit passed on to him from his parents . So he put the books outside the door of his house to see if anyone wanted to borrow them . They did , and they brought the books back with others to add to the collection . The library was born . The library is not advertised , but somehow , every day , a steady stream of people find their way there . To help the poorest communities in Manila , Guanlao does n ' t wait for them to find him on his \" book bike \" . He wants to set up a \" book boat \" , traveling around the islands of Sulu and Basilan . As we sat outside Hernando Guanlao ' s house in the midday sun , watching people look through his collection , he thought it was worth spending all his time .", "questions": "What was beyond people ' s expectation after the library was set up ?", "options": {"model": ["the library was not available at all .", "the library lasted a long time .", "people could n ' t find the library .", "the library had been closed off ."], "human": ["The library took over his house .", "The library was Guanlao ' s life center .", "The library needed help from more people .", "The library lasted a long time ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
