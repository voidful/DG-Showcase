{"id": "3446", "article": "Are we getting more stupid ? According to Gerald Crabtree , a scientist at Stanford University in the US , we are . You may not want to hear this , but Crabtree believes that human intelligence reached its peak more than 2 , 000 years ago and ever since then has been going downhill . \" If an average Greek from 1 , 000 BC were transported to modern times , he or she would be one of the brightest among us , \" Crabtree told The Guardian . At the heart of Crabtree ' s thinking is a simple idea . In the past , intelligence was critical for survival when our ancestors had to avoid dangerous animals and hunt for food . The difference of being smart or stupid is often life or death . However , after the spread of agriculture , when our ancestors began to live in dense farming communities , the need to keep their intelligence in peak condition gradually reduced . This is not hard to understand . Most of the time , pressure is what keeps us going - you need the pressure from your teachers to finish your homework ; the pressure of looking pretty prompts you to lose weight when summer comes . And the same is also true of our intelligence - if we think less , we become less smart . These mutations are harmful to our intelligence and they were all developed in the past 3 , 000 years . The other evidence that Crabtree holds is in our genes . He found that among the 2 , 000 to 5 , 000 genes that we have that determine human intelligence , there are two or more mutations in each of us . However , Crabtree ' s theory has been criticized by some who say that early humans may have better hunting and surviving abilities , but people today have developed a more diverse intelligence . For example , spearing a tiger does n ' t necessarily require more brainpower than playing chess or writing a poem . Moreover , the power of modern education means a lot more people have the opportunity to learn nowadays . \" You would n ' t get Stephen Hawking 2 , 000 years ago . He just would n ' t exist , \" Thomas Hills of the University of Warwick , UK , told Live Science . \" But now we have people of his intellectual capacity doing things and making insights that we would never have achieved in our environment of evolutionary adaptation . \"", "questions": "According to Crabtree , ancient humans", "options": {"model": ["could n ' t live a hard life or death until the spread of agriculture", "were forced to be smart due to natural selection pressures", "could n ' t have a good memory of human intelligence", "were able to control their intelligence well"], "human": ["had much more genes that determine human intelligence", "relied more on group intelligence than individual intelligence", "developed a diverse intelligence to adapt to the hard realities", "were forced to be smart due to natural selection pressures"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
