I know many kinds of collections . but do you know the collection of clocks ? My friend Mr . Clock , a short man , has the hobby . He has one thousand five hundred clocks . There are clocks here and there in his house . You can see lots of clocks on shelves . As there is not enough room for so many clocks , the man has to put clocks into some boxes under the beds in his house . Mr . Clock likes his large collection of clocks , but his wife , Mrs . Clock does not enjoy them at all . She complains every day because she has to do much work , for it is not easy to clean hundreds of clocks . She also complains about the noise . Each clock keeps a different time . So she can hear the chimes almost any time day and night . There is something even worse .
