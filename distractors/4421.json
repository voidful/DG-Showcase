Zhao jianmin , a professor at Shanghai University , said fragmented reading was part of modern life . \" The fast _ of life leaves many people no time to sit and read a whole book , \" he said . \" So making use of fragmented time to read is sure to be a trend \" Fragmented reading has its advantages .
