{"id": "249", "article": "Can you believe your eyes ? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age . Martin Doherty , a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland , led the team of scientists . In this experiment , Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people , using pictures of some orange circles . The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people . The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10 , and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25 . The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background . One of the circles was larger than the other , and these people were asked to identify the larger one . Four - year - olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time . Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time . Next , both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles , again of different sizes , were surrounded by gray circles . Here ' s where the trick lies in . In some of the pictures , the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles - - making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle , which was the real larger one . And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles - - so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle . When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures , they were n ' t fooled - - they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before . Older children and adults , on the other hand , did not do as well . Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one , and adults got it wrong most of the time . As children get older , Doherty said , their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context . In other words , they will begin to process the whole picture at once : the tricky gray circles , as well as the orange circle in the middle . As a result , they ' re more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick .", "questions": "According to the passage , we can know that", "options": {"model": ["the smaller the orange circle is , the smaller its real size is", "the smaller a circle is , the smaller it has a smaller effect on its size", "the smaller a circle is , the smaller it is", "a circle surrounded by bigger ones looks smaller than its real size"], "human": ["a smaller orange circle appears bigger on a white background", "an orange circle appears bigger than a gray one of the same size", "a circle surrounded by other circles looks bigger than its real size", "a circle surrounded by bigger ones looks smaller than its real size"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
