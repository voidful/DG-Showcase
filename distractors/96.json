{"id": "96", "article": "WASHINGTON : An analysis of global temperatures by independent statisticians shows the Earth is still warming and not cooling as some global warming skeptics are claiming . The analysis was conducted at the request of The Associated Press to investigate the legitimacy of talk of a cooling trend that has been spreading on the Internet , fueled by some news reports , a new book and temperatures that have been cooler in a few recent years . In short , it is not true , according to the statisticians who contributed to the analysis . The statisticians , reviewing two sets of temperature data , found no trend of falling temperatures over time . US government data show the decade that ends in December will be the warmest in 130 years of record - keeping , and 2005 was the hottest year recorded . The case that the Earth might be cooling partly stems from recent weather . Last year was cooler than previous years . It has been a while since the superhot years of 1998 and 2005 . So is this a longer climate trend or just weather ' s normal ups and downs ? In a blind test , the AP gave temperature data to four independent statisticians and asked them to look for trends , without telling them what the numbers represented . The experts found no true temperature declines over time . \" If you look at the data and sort of cherry - pick a microtrend within a bigger trend , that technique is particularly suspect , \" said John Grego , a professor of statistics at the University of South Carolina . Yet the idea that things are cooling has been repeated in opinion columns , a BBC news story posted on the Drudge Report and in a new book by the authors of the best - seller Freakonomics . Last week , a poll by the Pew Research Center found that only 57 percent of Americans now believe there is strong scientific evidence for global warming , down from 77 percent in 2006 .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["the earth is not becoming cooler as some people are claiming on the internet", "the earth ' s temperature growth has been influenced by the global warming", "the number of people who are suffering from the global warming is increasing", "the us government data show the decade that ends in december will be the warmest in 15 years of record - keeping ."], "human": ["five independent statisticians were given temperature data to look for trends", "more and more Americans now believe there is strong scientific evidence for global warming", "The analysis of global temperatures was required by the independent statisticians", "The earth is not becoming cooler as some people are claiming on the internet"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
