{"id": "2916", "article": "Findings from a new study were presented at a recent meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society . Researchers in the United States studied 100 , 000 women during an eight - year period , beginning in 1994 . All of the women were fifty or older . The study was part of the Women ' s Health Initiative organized by the National Institutes of Health . The women were asked questions measuring their beliefs or ideas about the future . The researchers attempted to identify each woman ' s personality eight years after gathering the information . The study found that hopeful individuals were 14 % less likely than other woman to have died from any cause . The hopeful women were also 30 less likely to have died from heart disease after the eight years , Hilary Tinkle from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania was the lead author of the report . She said the study confirmed earlier research that linked optimistic feelings to longer life . The researchers also gathered information about people ' s education , financial earnings , physical activity and use of alcohol or cigarettes . Independent of those things , the findings still showed that optimists had less of a chance of dying during the eight - year period . Some women who answered the questions were found to be hostile , or highly untrusting of others . These women were 16 % more likely to die than the others . They also were 23 % more likely to die of cancer . The study also found women who were not optimistic were more likely to smoke and have high blood pressure or diabetes . They were also more likely mot to exercise . Tindle says the study did not confirm whether optimism leads to healthier choices , or if it actually affects a person ' s physical health . She also says the study does not prove that negative emotions or distrust lead to bad health effects and shorter life . Yet there does appear to be a link that calls for more research .", "questions": "What can be inferred from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the study was carried out by the us .", "the more optimistic you are , the longer life you may enjoy .", "the more likely you live a happy life , the healthier you will be ."], "human": ["Negative emotions cause a shorter life indeed .", "It ' s uncertain whether optimism affects one ' s health .", "The more optimistic you are , the longer life you may enjoy ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
