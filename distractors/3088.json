{"id": "3088", "article": "When the US started the war in Iraq a year ago , Spain was a firm supporter . But on April 18 , the Spanish government started to remove its troops , becoming the first country in the US - led coalition to bring its soldiers home . The person behind this surprise move is the new Spanish prime minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero . A few months ago , he was hardly known outside his small hometown in northern Spain . Even a week before last month ' s general election , Zapatero was still considered an outsider for the top job . But just three days before the vote , a series of bomb attacks on three train stations in Madrid killed 191 people and injured some 1 , 900 . It was Spain ' s worst ever terrorist attack and it changed everything - - even making Zapatero prime minister . From the beginning , the 43 - year - old former lawyer , knew the weaknesses of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and his hand - picked successor , Mariano Rajoy . About 90 per cent of the Spanish people were against the war in Iraq and were unhappy that Aznar had taken them into it . So Zapatero promised : \" If this party wins the election and the UN still ca n ' t take charge in Iraq , the new government will pull its 1 , 400 troops out of Iraq . \" Despite focusing on this and other Aznar mistakes , Zapatero ' s chances of victory were still thin until the Madrid bombings . At first , the government blamed ETA , a separatist terror group from the Basque region of northern Spain . But later evidence suggested the attack was carried out by al - Qaida members angry at Spain ' s presence in Iraq . The people were upset , and they showed this by voting for Zapatero . Many accused the government of covering up information about the bombings and only blaming ETA so it would n ' t lose to an anti - war vote . In a move that was as shocking to the world as his election victory , Zapatero chose to carry out his promise the day after he took office . And its effect could be long - lasting . As the situation in Iraq worsens , several countries are considering their positions . The US is worried that other coalition members might follow Spain ' s lead", "questions": "The main idea of the passage is that", "options": {"model": ["the spanish government has taken measures to prevent the war in afghan .", "zapatero won the election and became prime minister of spain .", "zapatri was a member of spain ' s power .", "zapatat led a war in spain ."], "human": ["a series of bomb attacks happened in Madrid .", "Spain got its troops out of Iraq .", "the US feels worried about Spain ' s move out of Iraq .", "Zapatero won the election and became Prime Minister of Spain ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
