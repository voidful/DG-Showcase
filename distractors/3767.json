{"id": "3767", "article": "The Lunar New Year , which starts in late January this year , is the most important festival for Chinese people as most of them drop any business at hand to go back to their hometown to see their families . It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times , but as social mobility increases in modern times , the road to family reunions has become very uneasy . It is not the higher travel costs , nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items , but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad . I ' ve heard some colleagues complain that they have tried every means to secure a train ticket , only to find it a mission impossible . Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking ; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking . No doubt chunyun , the Spring Festival travel season , is the largest - scale annual human migration in the world . Last year , 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season , which usually lasts 40 days . It is a huge jump from 10 years ago , when the number was 128 million . With the big sudden increase in demand , the railway company has increased investment in railway construction ; still , it can not bridge the supply gap , leading to fierce public complaints and criticism . Admittedly , it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday . Moreover , any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season . What the company can reasonably do is gradually improve its capacity while focusing on better distribution of its existing resources during the special peak season . At any rate , however , the problem can not be solved overnight .", "questions": "Which of the following does the author probably agree with ?", "options": {"model": ["the latest software may increase the possibility of successful booking .", "the hot weather in the spring festival is the most important for chinese people .", "the spring festival season is the largest - frequency event in the world .", "the railway company has taken the place of the staff in the end ."], "human": ["Social mobility in modern times has n ' t changed much in these years .", "Higher travel costs discourage travelers from reunions with families .", "People nowadays cherish reunion with their families more than before .", "The latest software may increase the possibility of successful booking ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
