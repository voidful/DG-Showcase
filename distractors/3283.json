{"id": "3283", "article": "One day , Wilson was walking quietly along the road when someone hit him hard on the back of his neck . He looked behind him , and saw a young man whom he had never seen before . \" How dare you hit me like that ? \" shouted Wilson . The young man said he had mistaken Wilson for a friend of his and that he thought Wilson was making a lot of noise about nothing . This insult made Wilson even angrier , of course , and he at once decided to bring the young man before a judge . Now , the judge , who heard the case , was a friend of the young man ' s father ' s , and , although he pretended to be quite fair , he was thinking about what he could do to protect the young man from being punished while at the same time not to be appearing unfair . Finally he said to Wilson , \" I understand your feelings in this matter very well . Would you be satisfied if I let you hit the young man as he hit you ? \" Wilson said he would not be . The young man had insulted him and should be _ punished . \" Well , then , \" said the judge to the young man , \" I order you to pay ten coins to Wilson . \" Ten coins was very little for such a crime , but the young man did not have it with him , so the judge allowed him to go and get it . Wilson waited for him to return with the money . He waited an hour , and then two hours , while the judge took care of other business . When it was nearly time for the court to close , Wilson chose a moment when the judge was especially busy , came up quietly and hit him hard on the back of the neck . Then he said to him , \" I am sorry , but I ca n ' t wait any longer . When the young man comes back , tell him that I have passed my right to the ten coins on to you . \"", "questions": "Why did the young man hit Wilson from behind ?", "options": {"model": ["he was shocked at wilson ' s rude behavior .", "he had mistaken wilson for a friend of his .", "he did n ' t know he was a man .", "the young man did n ' t have the habit of having the money with him ."], "human": ["Wilson had hit him before .", "Wilson was a stranger there .", "Wilson made a lot of noise when he was walking .", "He had mistaken Wilson for a friend of his ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
