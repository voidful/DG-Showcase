{"id": "199", "article": "When Abraham Lincoln was invited to give a speech in Brooklyn , New York , in February 1860 , he was already famous throughout Illinois , but almost no one in the East knew what he looked like . The presidential election of 1860 was coming , and Lincoln , as a possible Republican candidate , wanted to increase his popularity . Hoping to introduce himself to hundreds of new voters , Lincoln eagerly accepted the invitation to the East . He wrote a powerful speech opposing slavery . Then he went to Springfield , Illinois by train . When Lincoln arrived in New York , he was surprised to learn that so many people had bought tickets for his speech that it had been moved from a small Brooklyn church to a New York City college . Lincoln got to town exhausted . His suit was badly wrinkled , and his one piece of luggage was old and covered with dust . Worst of all , his plain face , uncombed hair shocked those who greeted him . However , his admirers decided to have Lincoln photographed . If the cameraman could make Lincoln a little handsome , perhaps he could win more votes . They found the city ' s most famous photographer Brady . Brady and his assistants looked through the camera and surprised by what they saw . So they decided to make an adjustment before they took the picture . Brady walked over to Lincoln and pulled up Lincoln ' s shirt collar as high as it would go . As a result , the picture successfully covered up his long , ugly neck , which made Lincoln appear quite handsome . Lincoln ' s speech that day proved to be a triumph . So did the photograph . The photo inspired thousands of copies ; so many that Brady insisted that this picture became the means to Lincoln ' s election to the Presidency nine months later . If that ' s true it might be said that Lincoln won the election by a neck - - a neck that had been shortened in New York .", "questions": "According to the original plan , Lincoln would make a speech", "options": {"model": ["in a new york city", "at a small brooklyn church"], "human": ["in a New York City college", "at a small Brooklyn church"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
