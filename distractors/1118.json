{"id": "1118", "article": "Grand Opening Bentwood Truck Museum Saturday , November 8 , at 10 : 00 A . M . After eighteen months of hard work by more than 100 volunteers , the Bentwood Truck Museum is ready to open . The old factory had been scheduled to be destroyed . When Roger Haygood heard about the plan to tear down the building , he bought it so that he could store his collection of old trucks there . Then he had the idea of turning the building into a truck museum . During the past year and a half , the old building has been transformed into a treasure chest of memories . Instead of a dark and dull house , the building has become a cheery , bright home for all kinds of trucks from the past . The museum now houses 68 trucks , and we hope to have even more soon . There is a 1959 school bus , a 1942 bakery truck , and a 1937 fire engine . Our oldest vehicle is a 1919 milk truck . Our newest vehicle is a 1966 tow truck . You can take a ride on a fire truck , a mail truck , or an ice - cream truck . Rides are $ 2 . 00 , but you can get a ticket for a free ride at any grocery store in Bentwood . Help us celebrate our grand opening by bringing your family and friends ! There is something to interest everyone who attends . The Bentwood Truck Museum is a special piece of our history . To get to Bentwood Truck Museum , take Route 29 ( Kingston Highway ) to Palmer Street . Go south on Palmer Street for one block and take a left onto Norman Drive . You will see the museum building and the amusement park on your left . Parking is available across the street , on your right .", "questions": "What ' s the purpose of writing this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["to persuade readers to attend the opening of the museum .", "to show readers how to get to bentwood food museum .", "to introduce the history of the old building .", "to show readers how to get to the museum in a park ."], "human": ["To introduce the old history of Bentwood Truck Museum .", "To explain why Bentwood Truck Museum was set up .", "To call on the visitors to take a ride in old trucks .", "To persuade readers to attend the opening of the museum ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
