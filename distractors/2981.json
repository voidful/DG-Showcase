{"id": "2981", "article": "Time and how we experience it have always puzzled us . Physicists have created fascinating theories , but their time is measured by a pendulum and is not psychological time , which leaps with little regard to the clock or calendar . As some - one who understood the distinction observed , \" _ Psychologists have long noticed that larger units of time , such as months and years , fly on swifter wings as we age . They also note that the more time is structured with schedules and appointments , the more rapidly it seems to pass . For example , a day at the office flies compared with a day at the beach . Since most of us spend fewer days at the beach and more at the office as we age , an increase in structured tune could well be to blame for why time seems to speed up as we grow older . Expectation and familiarity also make time seem to flow more rapidly . Almost all of us have had the experience of driving somewhere we ' ve never been before . Surrounded by unfamiliar scenery , with no real idea of when we ' ll arrive , we experience the trip as lasting a long time . But the return trip , although exactly as long , seems to take far less time . The _ of the outward journey has become routine . Thus taking a different route on occasions can often help slow the clock . When was become as identical as identical as beads on a string , they mix together , and even months become a single day . To counter this , try to find ways to interrupt the structure of your day - - to stop time , so to speak . Learning something new is one of the ways to slow the passage of time . One of the reasons the days of our youth seems so full and long is that these are the days of learning and discovery . For many of us , learning ends when we leave school , but this does n ' t have to be .", "questions": "The purpose of the passage is to", "options": {"model": ["explain why time travels in different ways", "tell people how to use time to slow the clock", "explain why time flies and how to slow it down psychologically", "explain why time travels in different ways and different directionss"], "human": ["give various explanations about time", "describe how we experience time psychologically", "show the different ideas of physicists and psychologists on time", "explain why time flies and how to slow it down psychologically"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
