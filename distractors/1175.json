{"id": "1175", "article": "Besides entertainment and beautiful lanterns , another important part of the Lantern Festival , or Yuanxiao Festival is eating small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . We call these balls Yuanxiao or Tangyuan . Obviously , they get the name from the festival itself . It is said that the custom of eating Yuanxiao originated during the Eastern Jin Dynasty in the fourth century , then became popular during the Tang and Song periods . The fillings inside the dumplings or Yuansiao are either sweet or salty . Sweet fillings are made of sugar , Walnuts , sesame , osmanthus flowers , rose petals , sweetened tangerine peel , bean paste , or jujube paste . A single ingredient or any combination can be used as the filling . The salty variety is filled with minced meat , vegetables or a mixture . The way to make Yuanxiao also varies between northern and southern China . The usual method followed in southern provinces is to shape the dough of rice flour into balls , make a hole , insert the filling , then close the hole and smooth out the dumpling by rolling it between your hands . In North China , sweet or nutmeat stuffing is the usual ingredient . The fillings are pressed into hardened cores , dipped lightly in water and rolled in a flat basket containing dry glutinous rice flour . A layer of the flour sticks to the filling , which is then again dipped in water and rolled a second time in the rice flour . And so it goes , like rolling a snowball , until the dumpling is the desired size . The custom of eating Yuanxiao dumplings remains . This tradition encourages both old and new stores to promote their Yuanxiao products . They all try their best to improve the taste and quality of the dumplings to attract more customers .", "questions": "What is the best title of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the origin of traditional food .", "china ' s traditional food - - yuanxiao .", "the meaning of the chinese food .", "how to make hanxiao ."], "human": ["The Lantern Festival", "The ingredients of Yuanxiao", "The difference between Yuanxiao and Tangyuan .", "China ' s traditional food - - Yuanxiao ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
