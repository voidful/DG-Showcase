Mundine is Prime Minister Tony Abbott ' s top advisor on issues concerning Aboriginals , native Australians . \" Now , I know the government needs some necessary measures but I think punishing the parents is really the last choice . \" Mr . Mundine says the situation can be changed if the tribal leaders support education . \" We need to work with parents and communities because we are making a huge cultural change here . \" But other officials say they believe the threat of stopping aid will force families to take education more seriously . The State of South Australia says it has special programs for Aboriginal children . The students work with their parents and teachers first to develop a personal learning plan and the public schools provide special workers to work individually with Aboriginal students . At the age of seven , Aboriginal students can join a program called Enter for Success designed to attract students to school . The students can choose which high school to attend and receive support in reaching the goals on their individual learning plans . The State of Western Australia also has special programs for Aboriginal and other ethnic groups . The state operates a program called Focus Schools which centers on basic skills like reading , writing and counting . 67 % of these public focus schools serve the students in 79 very rural areas .
