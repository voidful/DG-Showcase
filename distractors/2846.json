{"id": "2846", "article": "Health officials issued a waring over common energy - saving lghtbulbs after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer . A study by the Health Protection Agency ( HPA ) found that some eco - friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation that are above recognized safety limits . The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco - friendly bulbs . The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods , such as jewellery makers , and others who might have lights close to their faces , such as car mechanics . John O ' Hagan , a scientist at the HPA ' s centre for radiation , chemical and environmental dangers , began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them . Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus , which makes people highly sensitive to light . The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation , measured 2 cm from the lightbulbs , were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer . The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn , but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this , again similar to that of sunburn . The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes . People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out . It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["people are not allowed to use open lightbalbs", "people are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work", "there is a growing problem of skin cancer in the world", "people are not allowed to use open lightbalbs for long close work"], "human": ["health officials issued a warning over common lightbulbs .", "jewellery makers should avoid working with the eco - friendly bulbs for more than one hour", "John O ' Hagan did tests on the lightbulbs with some patients", "people are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
