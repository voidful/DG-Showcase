{"id": "2411", "article": "There was a little boy with a bad temper . His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper , he must hammer a nail in the back fence . The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence . Then _ began to become less . He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence . Finally the day came when the boy did n ' t lose his temper at all . He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper . The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone . The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence . He said , \" You have done well , my son , but look at the holes in the fence . The fence will never be the same . When you say things in anger , they leave a scar just like this one . You can put a knife in a man and draw it out . It wo n ' t matter how many times you say I ' m sorry , the wound is still there . A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one . Friends are a very rare jewel , indeed . They make you smile and encourage you to succeed . They lend an ear , they share a word of praise , and they always want to open their hearts to us . Show your friends how much you care . Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND .", "questions": "The boy found", "options": {"model": ["his father was n ' t able to hold his temper at all", "his father was not able to hold his temper", "the more temper his father gave him , the more temper he would get", "the more nails he drove into the fence , the more he could control his temper"], "human": ["the more nails there were in the fence , the more he lost his temper", "the more nails there were in the fence , the easier he would lose his temper", "the more nails there were in the fence , the more he would drive them into the fence", "the more nails he drove into the fence , the more he could control his temper"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
