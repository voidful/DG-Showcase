{"id": "5111", "article": "I arrived in the UK last weekend to learn English . So far I have already made a few friends and had some traditional English food there . But after having three days of hamburgers , sandwiches and potatoes , I thought none could be more delicious than Chinese food , especially my favorite - - huo guo . You ca n ' t imagine how excited I was when I got to know that there was going to be a free meal of hotpot to welcome the new students . On the way to the canteen , I seemed to smell huo guo in the air . To my surprise , when I stepped into the room , I did n ' t see any sign of huo guo . Where was it ? With many questions in my head , I sat down to have the free meal . After talking with an English girl , I got to know that Chinese huo guo is completely different from hotpot . Chinese huo guo is written in two words - hot pot ; and hotpot , one word , is a traditional English dish . Hotpot is made from mutton and onion . On the top are pieces of potatoes . People put it in the oven all day in a heavy pot on a low heat . It takes very little effort to prepare . You can often see it at parties in the UK because it ' s easy to prepare for a large number of people and is not expensive . Hotpot does n ' t taste bad . However , I still miss huo guo - hot pot , two words !", "questions": "The writer felt excited when she learnt she would", "options": {"model": ["have her favorite food", "eat chinese huo guo"], "human": ["learn English in the UK", "have her favorite food"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
