{"id": "966", "article": "Being Authoritative Parents Phrases like \" tiger mom \" and ' ' helicopter parent \" have made their way into everyday language . Many of us find ourselves drawn to the idea that with just a bit more parental hard work and effort , we might turn out children with bright futures . But is there anything wrong with a kind of \" overparenting style \" ? Parental involvement has a long history of being studied . Many of the studies , conducted by Diana Baumrind , a famous psychologist at the University of California , Berkeley , have found that a good parent is the one who is involved and reacts to her child in a positive way , who sets high expectations but gives her child independence . These \" authoritative parents \" appear to hit the sweet spot of parental involvement and generally raise children who do better academically , psychologically and socially than children whose parents are not strict and less involved , or controlling and more involved . Why is this parenting style so successful ? Authoritative parents actually help improve motivation in their children . Carol Dweck , a social psychologist at Stanford University , has done research that indicates why authoritative parents raise more motivated children . In a typical experiment , Dr . Dweck takes young children into a room and asks them to solve a simple puzzle . Most do so with little difficulty . But then Dr . Dweck tells some , but not all , of the kids how clever they are . As it turns out , the children who are not told they ' re smart are more motivated to solve increasingly difficult puzzles . They also show higher levels of confidence and show greater progress in puzzle - solving . As the experiment suggests , praising children ' s talents and abilities seems to shake their confidence . Dealing with more difficult puzzles carries the risk of losing one ' s status as \" smart \" . Dr . Dweck ' s work strongly supports that of Dr . Baumrind , who also found that reasonably supporting a child ' s independence and limiting interference causes better academic and emotional results . The central task of growing up is to develop a sense of self that is independent and confident . If you treat your young child who is just learning to walk as if she ca n ' t walk , you reduce her confidence . Allowing children to make mistakes is one of the greatest challenges of parenting .
