{"id": "2975", "article": "The way people hold to the belief that a fun - filled , pain - free life equals happiness actually reduces their chances of ever attaining real happiness . If fun and pleasure are equal to happiness then pain must be equal to unhappiness . But in fact , the opposite is true : more often than not things that lead to happiness involve some pain . As a result , many people avoid the very attempts that are the source of true happiness . They fear the pain inevitably brought by such things as marriage , raising children , professional achievement , religious commitment , self improvement . Ask a bachelor why he resists marriage even though he finds dating to be less and less satisfying . If he is honest he will tell you that he is afraid of making a commitment . For commitment is in fact quite painful . The single life is filled with fun , adventure , excitement . Marriage has such moments , but they are not its most distinguishing features . Couples with infant children are lucky to get a whole night ' s sleep or a three - day vacation . I do n ' t know any parent who would choose the word fun to describe raising children . But couples who decide not to have children never know the joys of watching a child grow up or of playing with a grandchild . Understanding and accepting that true happiness has nothing to do with fun is one of the most liberating realizations . It liberates time : now we can devote more hours to activities that can genuinely increase our happiness . It liberates money : buying that new car or those fancy clothes that will do nothing to increase our happiness now seems pointless . And it liberates us from envy : we now understand that all those who are always having so much fun actually may not be happy at all .", "questions": "Raising children , in the author ' s opinion , is", "options": {"model": ["a pain for children", "a rewarding task"], "human": ["a source of inevitable pain", "a rewarding task"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
