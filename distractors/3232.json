{"id": "3232", "article": "A new study says one part of the human brain may become smaller as the result of a condition known as jet lag . Jet lag results from flying long distances in an airplane . Jet lag interferes with a person ' s normal times for sleeping and waking . People with jet lag may feel extremely tired for several days . They also may have problems thinking clearly and remembering . Kwangwook Cho is a researcher at the University of Bristol in Britain . He reported the findings of his jet lag study in the publication Nature Neuroscience . The study involved twenty young women who worked for international airlines . The women had served passengers on airplanes for five years . These flight attendants flew across many countries and at least seven time zones . In the study , the flight attendants had different amounts of time to recover from jet lag . Half the women spent five days or fewer in their home areas between long flights . The other half spent more than fourteen days in their home areas . Mister Cho took some fluid from the women ' s mouths to measure levels of a hormone that increases during stress . He tested them to see if they could remember where black spots appeared on a computer screen . And he took pictures of their brains using magnetic resonance imaging . This is a way to measure the size of the brain ' s temporal lobes . It was found that the women who had less time between flights had smaller right temporal lobes . This area of the brain deals with recognizing and remembering what is seen . The same group performed worse and had slower reaction times on the visual memory test . And their saliva samples showed higher levels of stress hormones . Mister Cho says he believes the brain needs at least ten days to recover after a long trip . He says airline workers told him their ability to remember got worse after working on planes for about four years . Other studies have shown that increased feelings of stress can cause a loss of cells in the part of the brain that controls memory . Scientists say more tests are needed to study the effects of jet lag on the brain . They want to find out if too much jet lag could permanently affect memory .", "questions": "What is the subject discussed in the test ?", "options": {"human": ["The cause of jet lag .", "A story of a group of flight attendance .", "The importance of having enough rest after long flights .", "A research about the effects of jet lag on the brain ."]}, "answer": {"human": 3}}
