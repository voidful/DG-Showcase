He asked how he made decisions and responded , \" lt s important to make good decisions . spend much less time and energy worrying about making the right decision and much more and energy ensuring that any decision I make turns out right . \" In fact , before we make any decisions , particularly those difficult ones , we re anxious focus on identifying the \" best \" option because of the risk of being \" wrong \" . But a side effect that mindset is that we pay too much attention to the moment of choice and sight of everything that follows . It ~ s what happens next that finally determines whether a decision was \" right \" . Another aspect of this mindset is that our focus on making the \" right \" decision can easy lead to paralysis ( , ) , because the options we - re choosing among are so difficult rank in the first place . How can we definitively determine in advance what career path will \" the best \" , or what job offer we should accept ? Obviously , we can ' ' t . Focusing on the effort after our decision not only helps us succeed , but also reminds us we play a role in every outcome . Our control should be in our day - to - day activrties rather than our one - time decision .", "questions": "Which of the following about Scott McNealy is TRUE ?", "options": {"model": ["he tries his best to follow the right decision .", "he tries his best to decide whether he is right .", "he tries his best to make his decision right in the end ."], "human": ["Making decisions is not very important for him .", "He never cares about whether his decision is good or not .", "He tries his best to make his decision right in the end ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
