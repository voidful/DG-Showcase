{"id": "5570", "article": "About ten years ago , a young and very successful businessman named Josh was traveling down a Chicago neighborhood street . He was going a bit too fast in his shiny , black , 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE , which was only two months old . He was watching for kids rushing out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something . As his car passed , no child came out , but a brick sailed out and - WHUMP ! - it hit the Jaguar ' s shiny black side door ! SCREECH . . . ! ! ! ! Immediately Josh stopped the car , jumped out , seized the kid and pushed him up against a parked car . He shouted at the kid , \" What was that all about and who are you ? Just what the heck are you doing ? ! \" \" That ' s my new Jaguar , that brick you threw is gon na cost you a lot of money . Why did you throw it ? \" \" Please , mister , please . . . I ' m sorry ! I did n ' t know what else to do ! \" begged the youngster . \" I threw the brick because no one else would stop ! \" tears were streaming down the boy ' s face as he pointed around the parked car . \" It ' s my brother , mister , \" he said . \" He rolled off the curb and fell out of his wheelchair and I ca n ' t lift him up . \" Sobbing , the boy asked the businessman , \" Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair ? He ' s hurt and he ' s too heavy for me . \" Moved by the words , the young businessman lifted the young man back into the wheelchair and took out his handkerchief and wiped the scrapers and cuts , checking to see that everything was going to be OK . He then watched the younger brother push him down the sidewalk toward their home . It was a long walk back to the black , shining , 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE - - a long and slow walk . Josh never did fix the side door of his Jaguar . He kept the dent to remind him not to go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at him to get his attention . Feel for the bricks of life coming you .", "questions": "What can we learn from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["josh was a kind - hearted man .", "the boy ' s new car was not as cheap as the boy ' s .", "josh was a young man .", "josh ' s car broke down after the kid got on ."], "human": ["Josh would accept the money from the kids .", "The two kids were Josh ' s neighbors .", "Josh ' s new car broke down easily .", "Josh was a kind - hearted man ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
