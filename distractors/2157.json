{"id": "2157", "article": "Most people think of a camel as an obedient beast of burden , because it is best known for its ability to carry heavy loads across vast stretches of desert without requiring water . In reality , the camel is considerably more than just the Arabian equivalent of mule . It also possesses a great amount of intelligence and sensitivity . The Arabs say that camels are so acutely aware of injustice and ill - treatment that a camel owner who punishes one of the beasts too hard finds it difficult to escape the camel ' s revenge . Apparently , the animal will remember an injury and wait for an opportunity to get revenge . In order to protect themselves from the vengeful beasts , Arabian camel drivers have learned to trick their camels into believing they have achieved revenge . When an Arab realizes that he has excited a camel ' s rage , he places his own garments on the ground in the animal ' s path . He arranges the clothing so that it appears to cover a man ' s body . When the camel recognizes its master ' s clothing on the ground , it seizes the pile with its teeth , shakes the garments angrily and steps on them in a rage again and again . In the end , after its rage has died away , the camel leaves , believing its revenge is completed . Only then does the owner of the garments comes out of hiding , safe for the time being , thanks to this clever trick .", "questions": "which of the following is true ?", "options": {"model": ["a camel is more likely to use water than a human .", "a man who punishes a camel harshly has to play a trick on it", "a camel is more likely to use its own clothing", "a camel is responsible for its punishment"], "human": ["A camel is very clever", "A camel is very dangerous to its owner", "The camel tramples the garments violently in the face of the owner of the garments .", "A man who punishes a camel harshly has to play a trick on it"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
