{"id": "1803", "article": "Scientists added a record of 715 more planets to the list known to the world beyond the solar system , astronomers said on Wednesday , in February 2014 . The additions include four planets about 0 . 5 - 2 times as big as Earth that are the right distance from their parent stars for liquid surface water , which is believed to be fit for life . The discoveries were made with the NASA ' s planet - hunting Kepler space telescope . The telescope , launched in 2009 , spent four productive years observing 160 , 000 target stars for signs of planets passing by , within the telescope ' s sight . The numbers of planets announced at a NASA press conference on Wednesday increased Kepler ' s confirmed planets from 246 to 961 . Combined with other telescopes ' results , the total number of planets beyond the solar system now is nearly 1 , 700 . \" We almost doubled , just today , the number of planets known to humans , \" astronomer Douglas Hudgins , head of planet exploration at NASA Headquarters in Washington , told reporters on a conference call . Many planets ' discovery is due to a new technique that analyzes potential planets in _ rather than one at a time . The method was developed after scientists realized that most planets , like those in the solar system , have similar worlds orbiting a common parent star . The newly found planets strengthen the evidence that small planets , two to three times the size of Earth , are common throughout the galaxy . \" Generally , wherever ( Kepler ) can see them , it finds them , \" said astronomer Sara Seager , with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . \" That ' s why we have confidence that there will be planets like Earth in outer space . \" Like the solar system , which has eight planets plus Pluto and other so - called \" dwarf planets , \" the newly found planets belong to families . But unlike the solar system ' s planets , which are about 150 times farther from the sun than Earth . Most of the planets fly nearer to their parent stars than Venus orbits the sun , a distance of about 67 million miles ( 108 million km . ) NASA and other space agencies are designing new telescopes to discover planets in so - called \" habit", "questions": "Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the new technique has been developed after scientists discovered many planets .", "kepler ' s discovery is based on a new method .", "kepler ' s discovery is based on the discovery of the new technique .", "there may be liquid surface water on some of the newly found planets ."], "human": ["All the planets known to the world are believed to be fit for life .", "Kepler space telescope spent four years observing 160 , 000 target planets .", "The orbits of the newly found planets are just like those of the solar system", "There may be liquid surface water on some of the newly found planets ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
