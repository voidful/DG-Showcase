So was her boyfriend . \" Later I realized that she did n ' t literally mean what she said and that she was not aware of the full meaning of the word ' hate ' in English , \" said Du . \" It was more a problem with translation , \" she added . Cultural differences can cause confusion about what words or even actions mean , an issue that has come to the forefront recently following the arrest of a Chinese doctoral degree student in New Jersey . Zhai Tiantian , who studied at the Stevens Institute of Technology , has been accused of trying to set fire to a campus building and of making threats to a professor who gave him a low mark . No physical _ took place but Zhai reportedly said something along the lines of \" at worst , I will risk anything on the line . \" The professor called the campus police . According to the indictment sheet , Zhai is facing the serious charge of making a terroristic threat . For a few days , Chinese media mistranslated , or misunderstood , the charges and reported that Zhai was being charged with terrorism . Some language experts have speculated that the disagreement between Zhai and the professor can also be chalked up to cultural and linguistic differences . \" What Chinese people regard as acceptable speech may be regarded by Americans as threats , \" said Luo Gang , the Chinese Consulate ' s Overseas Chinese Affairs consul . \" This is an unfortunate incident . Even though Zhai intended no harm , he has done himself a great deal of harm . \" Du , now 23 , said she supports Zhai ' s actions in fighting to save his academic career , but added he needs to learn more about communication in a foreign language . \" Chinese students in a foreign country must prepare more in terms of languages and conversation skills to avoid misunderstandings , \" she said .", "questions": "By saying \" It was more a problem with translation \" , what does Du Juan mean ?", "options": {"model": ["she did n ' t know what \" love \" really meant in daily development .", "her roommate did n ' t know what \" hate \" really meant in daily conservation .", "her boyfriend did n ' t know what \" hate \" mean in english ."], "human": ["Translation was not the real problem , as Du Juan and her roommate can both speak English .", "Du Juan can not understand what her roommate meant at all .", "Her roommate did n ' t know what \" hate \" really meant in daily conservation ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
