{"id": "5518", "article": "Children grow quickly , especially their feet , but many families can not buy new shoes each time a child needs them . As a result , about 300 million children around the world go barefoot . Those children risk picking up diseases and parasites from the soil . An American man may have a solution for those barefoot kids - - a shoe that grows with the child . Kenton Lee is the creator of The Shoe That Grows . He explains how the shoe works and how it is able to last so long . \" It grows in three places : the front ; it can also grow on the side with Velcro ; and on the back with our buckle . It can last up to five years . The bottom is compressed rubber like tire rubber . The top is just high - quality leather . \" The shoe comes in two sizes : small that fits children aged 4 to 9 and large for children aged 9 to 14 . Lee says he got the idea for the shoe while working as a volunteer in an orphanage in Kenya . \" . . . and there was a little girl in a white dress walking next to me . And I just remember looking down and seeing how small her shoes were . They were just way too small for her feet . They were so small that she had to cut open the front of her shoes to let her toes stick out . And I just remember thinking , would n ' t it be nice if there were a pair of shoes that could grow with her feet ? \" However , Lee says it was not easy to turn his idea into a reality . \" I kept writing down I should do this because of this or because of that . All these reasons why it really was important for me to try to make the shoes that could grow and try to help . \" Finally , in 2009 Lee founded a non - profit organization called Because International . In the office of Because International , Lee keeps a pair of his own shoes to help him remember his promise . \" I told myself I would not get new shoes until the idea was done . So , those are the shoes that I wore for a little over five years . \"", "questions": "What does Para . 4 mainly talk about ?", "options": {"model": ["how lee makes shoes for children .", "how lee got his inspiration .", "how lee created the shoe .", "how lee ' s new shoes work ."], "human": ["How the shoes work .", "How to make the new shoes .", "Where to order this kind of shoes .", "How Lee got his inspiration ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
