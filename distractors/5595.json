{"id": "5595", "article": "Every year , Americans send millions of tons of food to the landfill . What if you could use all of those rotten vegetables to heat your home ? That ' s happening in one unlikely laboratory : the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plan in Brooklyn The plant ' s longtime manager , Jimmy Pynn , shows off the plant ' s crown jewels : eight huge , shiny , oval - shaped steel tanks known as digester eggs . Each one contains millions of gallons of black material that ' s roughly pea soup . Pynn calls it \" black gold \" . \" The digesters like to be fed like us : three times a day , \" he says . \" They like to be kept warm , 98 degrees . And that ' s what we have these guys for : to make methane , which can be used to heat homes or make electricity . \" Right now , what these bacteria are digesting is mostly sewage mud . But they are being introduced to a new diet food scraps . The hope is that this plant will soon take in hundreds of tons of organic waste from houses and apartments . \" Cardboard packaging , rotten tomatoes , fats , oils , old diary products - - those are all great food - stuff for a digester , \" says Paul Sellew . \" My micro - organisms love that . That ' s their five - course meal . \" \" Everything in New York City is like big scale when you ' re talking about quantities of waste , \" says Samantha MacBride . \" Right now , it ' s all in its infancy . When you ' re in an apartment building , to separate out food scraps , it requires a lot of effort and attention , \" says MacBride . \" It does n ' t have to have unpleasant smell or be inconvenient . But it takes extra work . It ' s the first , what I will call the baby step , \" says Paul Sellew . \" Because ultimately in New York City , just the restaurants alone , you ' re talking well over a million tons a year , \" he says . This new industry is trying to build more plants and digesters to handle all of that waste , says Sellew . The costliest part may be finding good locations in or around the nation ' s biggest cities . As for the trillions of bacteria ?
