It was also said that she could be in line for a share of up to PS30 , 000 reward money . Vicki Brown , 30 , played a very important role in ending the nationwide manhunt . Vicki , who has worked at the Royal Hotel for four years , told of her terrible experience when she had to steal into Bieber ' s bedroom and to watch him secretly . Then she waited alone for three hours while armed police prepared to storm the building . She said : \" I was very nervous . But when I opened the hotel door and saw 20 armed policemen lined up in the car park I was so glad they were there . \" The alarm had been raised because Vicki became suspicious of the guest who checked in at 8 pm the day before New Year ' s Eve with little luggage and wearing sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face . She said : \" He did n ' t seem to want to talk too much and make any eye contact . \" Vicki , the only employee on duty , called her boss Margaret , 64 , and husband Stan McKale , 65 , who phoned the police at 11 pm . Officers from Northumbria Police called Vicki at the hotel in Dunston , Gateshead , at about 11 : 30 pm to make sure that this was the wanted man . Then they kept in touch by phoning Vicki every 15 minutes . \" It was about ten to two in the morning when the phone went again and a policeman said ' Would you go and make yourself known to the armed officers outside ? ' My heart missed a beat . \" Vicki quietly showed eight armed officers through passages and staircases to the top floor room and handed over the key . \" I realized that my bedroom window overlooks that part of the hotel , so I went to watch . I could not see into the man ' s room , but I could see the passage . The police kept shouting at the man to come out with his hands showing . Then suddenly he must have come out because they shouted for him to lie down while he was handcuffed . \"", "questions": "Vicki became suspicious of David Bieber because", "options": {"model": ["he did n ' t look at the man ' s eyes", "he came to the hotel with little luggage and wore sunglasses", "he looked very strange", "he came to the hotel before new year ' s eve"], "human": ["the police called her", "he came to the hotel with little luggage", "he came to the hotel the day before New Year ' s Eve", "he looked very strange"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
