{"id": "2869", "article": "I was fortunate enough to discover my love for flying when I was very young . Lucky that some things went my way : my eyesight , for example , was good enough to allow me to become a fighter pilot . And lucky that when I left the army , I found work as an airline pilot , when such jobs were n ' t plentiful . I still feel lucky , after all these years , to be able to follow my passion . The airline industry has its problems , and a lot of them can be troubling , but I still find purpose and satisfaction in flying . There ' s some freedom you feel when you ' re flying above the surface of the earth , no longer limited by gravity . Even at a thousand feet , you get a wider perspective . Problems that seem large down below feel smaller from that height , and smaller still by the time you reach thirty - five thousand feet . I love that flying is an intellectual challenge . If you change the angle of the nose by even one degree while traveling at a typical commercial airliner speed of seven miles a minute , it ' s enough to increase or decrease your rate of climb or descent by seven hundred feet per minute . I enjoy keeping track of all the calculations , staying aware of the weather conditions , working with a team while knowing closely what the plane can and can not do . I like the challenge of that . I also like sharing my passion for flying . It ' s a disappointment to me that a lot of kids today are n ' t fascinated by flight . I ' ve watched countless children walk past the plane without paying much attention ; they ' re too focused on their video games or their iPods . When there are children who eagerly want a look inside \" my office \" at the front of the plane , it ' s so rewarding to see their excitement about something I care deeply about . If we are n ' t busy during boarding , the first officer and I enjoy inviting curious children to sit in our seats in the cockpit , ask questions , and let their parents take photos of them wearing a captain ' s hat . Being a pilot has a tangible end result that is beneficial to society . It feels good to take a planeload of 183 people where they need or want to go . My job is to reunite people with family and friends , to send them on vacations , to bring them to loved ones ' funeral", "questions": "What makes the author feel lucky is that", "options": {"model": ["he was able to find a job as", "he was able to find a job as a pilot"], "human": ["he began flying even when he was very young", "he was able to find a job as a pilot"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
