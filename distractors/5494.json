{"id": "5494", "article": "Warm weather brought by El Nino has had mixed effects on animals in usually snowy places in North America , including New England , according to an Associated Press article . Some animals seem to benefit from having a chance to gather more food before winter , and from expending less energy in daily survival mode . Others , like snowshoe hares , are put at center stage in predators ' view when they lack snow for disguising their white fur - - not a good thing for them , of course . Black bears , on the other hand , have been keeping busy gathering nuts and apples , when they would normally have settled into their winter homes by now . Vermont and Massachusetts officials have asked residents to wait till snow falls to take out their bird feeders for the sake of safety , the article said . \" We suggest waiting for 6 or more inches of snow that lasts before taking out your bird feeders , especially if you have been visited in the past by bears or if there are sightings of bears in your neighborhood , \" Forrest Hammond , Vermont Fish and Wildlife ' s bear biologist , said in the article . \" Due to lack of snow and frozen ground , birds are able to seek food in fields and forests for theirnatural foods . \" Snow amounts can also determine how comfortable bears are and how quickly they consume their accumulated fat during hibernation , noted Hammond in the article . This is because snow covers and traps them in their winter homes , and also hides them from predators .", "questions": "What do the bear biologist ' s words imply ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s good to protect birds in winter .", "the weather in the winter is very warm .", "warm weather benefits birds in winter .", "it ' s good for birds to feed animals in winter ."], "human": ["A heavy snow is on the way .", "Bears are common nowadays .", "Bears live mainly on birds in winter .", "Warm weather benefits birds in winter ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
