{"id": "3354", "article": "Sri Lankan police made an appeal for the public to donate their pet dogs to help the fight against terrorism and crime on the war - torn island . \" Make your pet a hero - to detect terrorism and make our motherland Sri Lanka a country with a new facelift , \" the police department said in a public notice carried by the state - run Daily News . It said that donated dogs should be between six months and two years old and must have an impressive pedigree . German Shepherds , Labrador Retrievers , Rottweilers , Dalmatians , Cocker Spaniels and Doberman Pinschers are preferred . Chief Inspector Lal Senavirathne said 25 people donated their pets , but only 18 dogs could be enlisted as the others did not meet the recruitment . He said the dogs would be trained to identify explosives , search for buried mines , sniff down drugs , deal with criminals and even perform tricks for the public . The dogs will retire after serving a maximum period of eight years and will be returned to their original owners . \" We already have 170 dogs deployed in 30 units , including the operational area or conflict areas in the island ' s north and east \" , Senavirathne told AFP by telephone from his headquarters in the central town of Kandy . He said it was the first time they were making a public appeal because of pressure on the police kennels , which usually import about half of their annual requirement . \" This time , we hope to enlist about 50 dogs . They will be given six months extensive training and another six months on the job , \" he said . \" Thereafter they will be officially called Police Dogs . \" Sri Lanka ' s dog population is about 2 . 3 million while it has 19 . 5 million people , and about 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 people are annually treated for homeless dog bites .", "questions": "What can we infer from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["many dogs in the country are left uncared for .", "the government will raise more dogs in the country .", "the police will send the dogs to the local people in the country .", "the government will change the government ' s decision to protect dogs ."], "human": ["The number of dogs in the country is reasonable .", "Dogs will begin working immediately chosen .", "The country ' s public order is very satisfying .", "Many dogs in the country are left uncared for ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
