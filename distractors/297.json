{"id": "297", "article": "One day an ant was drinking at a small stream and fell in . She made desperate efforts to reach the side , but made no progress at all . The poor ant almost exhausted was still bravely doing her best when a dove saw her . Moved with pity , the bird threw her a blade of grass , which supported her like a raft , and thus the ant reached the bank again . While she was resting and drying herself in the grass , she heard a man come near . He was walking along barefooted with a gun in his hand . As soon as he saw the dove , he wished to kill it . He would certainly have done so , but the ant bit him in the foot just as he raised his gun to fire . He stopped to see what had bit him , and the dove immediately flew away . It was an animal much weaker and smaller than herself that had saved her life .", "questions": "Just as the man shot at the dove ,", "options": {"model": ["he saw the bird was bitten in the foot", "he was bitten by the bird", "he wanted to kill the ant", "he felt something biting him in the foot"], "human": ["the dove immediately flew away", "the dove hid himself in the grass", "the ant told the dove to leave at once", "he felt something biting him in the foot"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
