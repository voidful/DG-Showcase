{"id": "1679", "article": "The fame of Jane IN the 19th century the novel came into its own . Thousands upon thousands of novels were published . Of those novels , very few are remembered today . However , there are exceptions ; the works of Jane Austen - Pride and Prejudice , Sense and Sensibility - for example . They achieved only modest success at first but grew and grew in fame and reputation . How did Jane Austen become so popular ? Of course , the novels are romantic . Everyone knows the love story of Mr . Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett ( in Pride and Prejudice ) , and how they overcome their own pride and prejudice to live happily ever after . The lovers are almost as famous today as Romeo and Juliet . But there is more to Austen ' s popularity than the fact that she wrote about love . The books are very witty and ironic , and show a great understanding of society and of people . Pride and Prejudice opens with what must be the most famous sentence in the English novel : \" It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . \" The truth , of course , is the opposite : wealthy , unmarried young men are extremely attractive to young women . And women - especially penniless or near - penniless ones - are the subjects of Austen ' s tales . Women nowadays may be more equal to men than they were in Jane Austen ' s day . However , a sense that women still basically live in a world dominated by men ensures that Austen still has many keen readers .", "questions": "What is the point of the article ?", "options": {"model": ["to explain the reason why jane austen ' s works are popular .", "to explain why jane austen ' s novels are popular .", "to analyze why jane austen ' s novels have such a lasting appeal .", "to explain the reason why jane austen ' s works are out of popularity ."], "human": ["To describe the status of women in Jane Austen ' s time .", "To promote Jane Austen ' s novels among teenagers .", "To explore the characteristics of Jane Austen ' s novels .", "To analyze why Jane Austen ' s novels have such a lasting appeal ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
