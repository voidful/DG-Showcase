Research shows that around fifteen million Americans suffer from social anxiety disorder . People in this condition feel that they are always being watched . Even though they know these fears are unreasonable , they can not overcome their fears on their own . Social anxiety disorder sufferers are often misdiagnosed with conditions such as schizophrenia and personality disorder . Many feel lonely , and are unsure whether anyone else can understand their thoughts and emotions . This can lead to withdrawal from most social situations , even to being unable to hold employment . Those who suffer from social anxiety disorder are often dismissed as being shy . This is simply not the case ; shyness is not even a symptom of social anxiety disorder .
