{"id": "4762", "article": "Long long ago , a king had a big rock placed in the middle of a very busy road . Then he hid nearby to see if anyone would move the rock out of the way to make it convenient for others . Some of the king ' s wealthiest supporters came past and simply walked around it . Many others complained about the rock and some blamed the king for the problem . To the king ' s surprise , no one did anything about moving it out of the way . Finally , a poor farmer came along , carrying a load of old vegetables . When he saw the rock , he put down his load , and tried to move the heavy rock to the side of the road . No one stopped to help him . Many laughed at him and made jokes as they walked past . Finally , after much pushing and straining , and with no help , the farmer managed to get the rock to the side of the road . As he bent down to pick up his vegetables , he noticed a small bag lying in the road , exactly where the rock had been . There was a lot of money and a note in the bag . The note was from the king saying that the money was for the person who moved the rock out of the way . Taking responsibility is about solving hard problems . The farmer takes responsibility when no one else is prepared to . It does not always mean that you will get an instant reward , but it is a value that builds up a community , and makes life better for all of us .", "questions": "The story mainly tells us that", "options": {"model": ["everyone should learn to take responsibility", "we should take responsibility when we are doing something"], "human": ["taking responsibility always means getting a reward", "everyone should learn to take responsibility"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
