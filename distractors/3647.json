{"id": "3647", "article": "Is there a nationwide shortage of nurses ? It ' s hard to say . However , some characteristic symptoms often indicate that there is indeed a shortage . One symptom is the vacancy rate , or the percentage of budgeted positions that are unfilled . New England ' s hospitals currently report that an average of 7 to 12 percent of their registered nurse positions are vacant , the highest level since the last shortage in the late 1980s . Vermont has a ly low vacancy rate , at 7 . 8 percent . But its vacancies were at 1 . 2 percent just five years ago . Another symptom is the increased use of stopgap measures to fill empty positions . For instance , many nurses report an _ in how frequently they are asked to stay past their shifts . According to Murphy , working in the St . Elizabeth ' s Hospital , \" The shortage has definitely created a lot of opportunities of overtime for our nurses , whether they want them or not . \" Similarly , a national survey of registered nurses shows that in an average week , nurses in the U . S . work 2 . 4 more hours than they are scheduled to . Much of this extra time is voluntary , as nurses earn overtime pay when they stay to fill in blanks in the schedule . When they ca n ' t fill open positions by more traditional means , health care providers hire temporary staff to tide them over . Travelling workers are the largest part of the temporary health care workforce , hired for thirteen - week reduction at health care facilities facing short - term lack of workers . Temporary workers , mainly nurses , cost hospitals $ 7 . 2 billion in 2000 . \" Any successful solution to the shortage depends on convincing more people to become nurses , and that is not an easy goal to reach . To achieve it , \" says Buerhaus , \" society needs to place more value on nursing . Legislation ca n ' t do that - it should come from people . \" And if this continues , we might have to learn to care for ourselves in the hospital .", "questions": "The temporary staff hired by a hospital", "options": {"model": ["are the largest part of the medical care staff", "meet the need for nurses in the hospital for a short time"], "human": ["cost a large part of the hospital ' s budget", "meet the need for nurses in the hospital for a short time"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
