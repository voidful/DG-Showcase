{"id": "186", "article": "_ Countries would probably pass ' no reproduction ' laws to keep population balanced , but obviously not everyone would observe . The world ' s population would grow very quickly at that . Animals and plants would die out , because humans needed the food . There would be no room for more people in the world . Scientists would most likely try to create living ' communities ' underwater , on the moon , and in space stations . The state of starvation and lack of space would be difficult to deal with . Natural selection would happen with humans , which is when certain types of animals or plants are selected for , or selected against . For instance , rich humans and strong , tough humans would be more likely to live , because the rich could afford to buy the limited food , and the tough humans could kill people for their food , and steal the food . This possibility relates directly to the assumption that humans would not die of diseases and such , but must be killed or run out of the necessities for living . If you mean that no one could ever die , even if they were shot , burned , starved and eaten , then that would never ever happen ; _ . However , if that were the case , then at some point , if there were not more areas to live than the land that humans live on now , then we would end up so packed that it would be virtually impossible to move , and humans would be forced to be on top of other people . It would be ridiculously crowded . Although , if humans lived forever , then I assume that we would all be extremely smart , and would have figured out solutions to the living situations , like on another planet , on the moon , under water , etc .", "questions": "What is the author ' s main purpose of writing the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["to argue that no human beings will die out .", "to explain why humans will live in the future .", "to explain why humans will live forever .", "to argue that no human being is likely to live forever ."], "human": ["To analyze the possibility that animals and plants die out .", "To explain why scientists will create living areas for humans .", "To convince people that it is possible for humans to live on other planets .", "To argue that no human being is likely to live forever ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
