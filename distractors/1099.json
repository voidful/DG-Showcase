{"id": "1099", "article": "It was Saturday , so Mr . Smith did not have to go to work . It had snowed heavily the night before , and Mr . Smith ' s son Bobby had a new sledge , which he had been very eager to try out for a long while . There was a good slope in a park not far away from the Smiths ' house - - a slope which children often used for their sledges , so Mr . Smith agreed to take Bobby there in the car . They put the sledge in and went off . When they reached the park , they found that there were already a lot of boys there , each boy with a sledge of his own . They were sliding down the slope at great speed , and then pulling their sledges up again for another go . Mr . Smith stood by , watching them with a smile . It was obvious that each and every one of them had much fun . After a few moments , Mr . Smith suddenly saw among the boys a kid who was small and poorly - dressed , and did not have a sledge . This boy had flattened out one old cardboard box , and was sliding down the slope on that . Mr . Smith felt very sorry for this poor boy , and determined to tell his son Bobby to share his new sledge with the boy . But before he could catch Bobby to speak to him , he was somewhat surprised - - and much more delighted - - to notice that several of the older boys in the park were already offering the poor boy their nice sledges . Mr . Smith watched them with greater interest - - and suddenly realized that the bigger boys were not doing this because they felt sorry for the poor boy , but because they enjoyed riding on his cardboard box more than on their own sledges . They were actually waiting eagerly and impatiently for a turn on the flattened cardboard box !", "questions": "What did Mr .
