He asked how he made decisions and responded , \" lt s important to make good decisions . spend much less time and energy worrying about making the right decision and much more and energy ensuring that any decision I make turns out right . \" In fact , before we make any decisions , particularly those difficult ones , we re anxious focus on identifying the \" best \" option because of the risk of being \" wrong \" . But a side effect that mindset is that we pay too much attention to the moment of choice and sight of everything that follows . It ~ s what happens next that finally determines whether a decision was \" right \" . Another aspect of this mindset is that our focus on making the \" right \" decision can easy lead to paralysis ( , ) , because the options we - re choosing among are so difficult rank in the first place . How can we definitively determine in advance what career path will \" the best \" , or what job offer we should accept ? Obviously , we can ' ' t .
