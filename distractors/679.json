Monday at London ' s Savoy Hotel and , with autograph books and cameras , a group of brighteyed tennis fans of all ages were waiting for just a glimpse of Maria Sharapova . The 17 - year - old girl defeated champion Serena Williams 6 - 1 6 - 4 in the Wimbledon final on Saturday in London to become the first Russian to win a single title at the championships .

Nobody was complaining , though , for the 1 . 83 - metre Sharapova has created a welcome wave of interest in tennis , something missing in recent years . Not even Anna Kournikova evoked such passion when she broke on to the scene . To look good on court is one thing , but Sharapova can actually play the game too . Extremely well . She proved it over 13 days at the world ' s most prestigious tournament . Playing tennis of the highest quality throughout , the Russian ' s triumph not only lifted the tournament from fits of rain - induced depression but also salvaged ( ; ) the season for the woman ' s tour . Sharapova was given no easy ride in the tournament , having to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals and twice - champion Serena Williams for the title .

Sharapova will return to her adoptive Florida home knowing life will never be the same again . But the girl who arrived in the US aged seven with her father and just US $ 700 is determined not to let fame and riches detract from her number one love , tennis . \" I know things will start coming up and that many more things will want to get involved , but I want to keep my head cool and play tennis , \" she said .", "questions": "Who has won the most times in Wimbledon ?", "options": {"model": ["serena williams .", "rzarva ."], "human": ["Sharapova .", "Serena Williams ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
