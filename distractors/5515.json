{"id": "5515", "article": "Two new studies have investigated why fewer women , compared to men , study and work in the so - called STEM subjects in the United States : science , technology , engineering and mathematics . The American Association of University Women ( AAUW ) examined existing research . Its report \" Why So Few ? \" suggested ways to interest more girls and women in the STEM fields . The researchers found that cultural and environmental factors make a difference . Researcher Christianne Corbett says more boys than girls score very high on math tests in most countries , but Iceland and Thailand are exceptions . \" This is something that we point out in our report - - that cultural factors and societal factors can make a difference in who achieves at the very high levels and whether girls are achieving or not . \" Another study carried out by the Campos Company for the Bayer Corporation in the United States asked more than 1 , 000 women and minority members of the American Chemical Society about their experiences . 77 % said not enough women and minorities are working in STEM today , because they were not encouraged to study those subjects in school . The study , producing results similar to the AAUW research showed there ' s still a lot of work to be done . \" They say their interest in science begins before the age of eleven . So we need programs that get in front of kids while they ' re young in elementary school . \" Increasing diversity in professions leads to better products , better science . And developing this science and engineering workforce is important to the nation ' s economic development . \" No matter what career you go into , whether it ' s accounting , human resources or science career , it ' s important that you can think creatively , you can work in teams , you can adapt to change and that ' s important for everybody , \" says Rebecca Lucore .", "questions": "What ' s the importance of having more women engaged in STEM subjects ?", "options": {"model": ["men and women in stem subjects are more creative than women in stem subjects .", "having both women and men in science and engineering can produce better scientific achievement .", "men and women in the same field have both subjects .", "more and more women are taking part in the research ."], "human": ["Women can help men in science and engineering work .", "Women are wiser and more cooperative than men .", "Women play a more important part in scientific research .", "Having both women and men in science and engineering can produce better scientific achievement ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
