{"id": "3550", "article": "Dear mommy and daddy , I write this letter to you in hopes that you should consider your method of parenting me before I arrive . I am a joyous child . I expect love and respect , order and discipline . When I arrive , I will seem very small to you . Even though I do n ' t look like an adult , please understand that I am a human being . Even though I will not speak words to you , I will know you with my heart . I will feel all your feelings , absorb your thoughts . I will come to know you more than you may know yourself . Do not be misled by my silence . I am open , growing and learning more rapidly than you can imagine . I will keep in heart all that I see , so please give me sweet music and language that tells me how much I am loved . Give me silence to rest my ears . I will absorb all that I feel , so please wrap life in love . I am waiting patiently to be with you . I am so happy to have the opportunity to be alive . Maybe when you see me you will remember how precious life is too ! Your joyous child", "questions": "The child in the text required all the following EXCEPT that", "options": {"model": ["the child wanted to be thankful to his parents", "it wanted to be with the parents an soon as possible"], "human": ["it wanted a place full of beautiful music and love language", "it wanted to be with the parents an soon as possible"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
