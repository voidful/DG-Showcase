{"id": "5361", "article": "For my brother and I , mowing yards during the summer is a good way to earn pocket change . Dad was our salesman . He traded our service to neighbors at a low price they could not refuse . My brother and I got $ 10 per yard . However , I later found out our competitors were charging $ 20 or more for the same amount of work . One afternoon we were cutting our neighbor ' s yard . When I was finishing up , I was tired and sweaty . I pictured the tall glass of icy drink I would have to cool down soon . I was just about to cut off the lawn mower when I saw Dad pointing to one piece . I thought about the poor change I was getting paid for cutting grass so high that it almost broke the mower . I ignored him and kept walking . Dad called me out , \" You missed a piece . \" I frowned , hoping he would let me slide and go home . He kept pointing . So angry , I went back to cut that piece of grass . I said to myself , \" That one piece is n ' t hurting anyone . Why wo n ' t he just let it go ? \" But when I became an adult , I understood his message : When you are running a business , the work you do says a great deal about you . If you want to be seen as a businessman with honesty , you must deliver a quality product . That single piece of grass meant the job was not done . Other neighbors took notice of the good work we did and we soon got more business . We started out with one client , but by the end of the summer we had five . The lesson my dad taught me stayed with me : If you say you are going to perform a job at a certain time , keep your word . Give your customers the kind of service you would like to receive . It shows how sincere you are and how much pride you take in your work .", "questions": "Which of the following statement is true ?", "options": {"model": ["his father ' s service was good but cheap .", "his father did n ' t allow him to go out of the shop ."], "human": ["His neighbors thought their service was poor .", "His father ' s service was good but cheap ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
