But there are some people who seem able to \" fast \" for very long periods . Various records are claimed for long fast , but in most cases there is no medical proof and so the records are doubtful . One South African woman claimed that she lived for 102 days on nothinig but water and soda water . There are great differences among living things in the ability to survive without food . For example , a tick , which lives on animals , may survive a whole year . Warm - blooded animals use up their stores of food in the body more quickly . In fact , the smaller and more active the animal , the more quickly it uses up its reserves . A small bird starves to death in about five days , a dog in about twenty . In general , we can say that a warm - blooded creature will die when it has lost about half its normal weight . This matter of weight is important . Man and other creatures live in a state of metabolic equiplibrium which means maintaining the body weight once a certain point has been reached . This regulation of body weight is done by thirst , hunger , and appetite . When your blood lacks nutritional materials , this registers in the hunger center of the brain and you feel \" hungry \" . The body is crying out for any kind of fuel ( food ) . And it is our appetite that sees to it hat we chooose a mixed diet , which is the kind the body needs .", "questions": "A tick can survive much longer than a bird because", "options": {"model": ["a bird is more active", "a bird is more active than a bird"], "human": ["a tick lives on animals", "a bird is more active"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
