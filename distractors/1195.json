{"id": "1195", "article": "Recently , a small group of birdwatchers spent three weeks around Mount Vernon . They were busy counting wild birds on Mount Vernon ' s wetlands , south of Washington , D . C . They began in the middle of December and worked until the beginning of January , 2015 . The birdwatchers were among 70 , 000 volunteers who collected information for the National Audubon Society , a U . S . conservation group . They counted birds in more than 2 , 400 areas in the United States , Canada , the Caribbean Sea and other parts of the Americas . The Audubon Society ' s first \" Christmas Bird Count \" took place 115 years ago in 1900 . At that time , a man named Frank Chapman suggested a new Christmas tradition that people count birds instead of shooting them around the holiday . Harry Glasgow has taken part in the Christmas Bird Count for the past 10 years . This year , he was one of the volunteer birdwatchers at Mount Vernon . \" I think it ' s a tremendous use of a lot of unofficial talent around the nation to keep track of birds . Birds are one of the surest indicators of the health of ecology . \" Last year , the bird count recorded over 66 million birds of 2 , 403 different species . Gary Langham is chief scientist with the National Audubon Society . \" The Audubon climate report says that half the birds in North America - - 314 out of 588 species - - are seriously threatened by climate change . The impacts sort of cut across all birds , all sizes , all kinds , all places . \" Information from the bird counts has shown that birds are staying farther north during the winter months because of warmer weather . Birdwatcher Jaime Reidy has noted the difference close to Washington , in the state of Virginia . \" You get to see them at odd times of the year , a little earlier , staying a little later . \" Gary Langham says other conditions are affecting bird populations . \" You can imagine the birds that live along the beach or along the rocky shore line as sea levels are rising around the world . That is impacting them , you know . \" David Yarnold is president of the Audubon Society .
