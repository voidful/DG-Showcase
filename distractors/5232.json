Our bodies : Levels of obesity are rising , especially young children . But this is n ' t just a problem about what we eat . Many people , especially teenagers , like sitting in front of TV sets or computers for hours , just watching or playing games . As a result , they do less exercise . Our brains : Research into the effects on the human brain while playing computer games is ongoing .
