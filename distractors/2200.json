{"id": "2200", "article": "A person who is deaf when he is born is usually dumb as well . There may be nothing wrong with his mouth and tongue , but he can not speak . This is because he can not hear people , so he has nothing to imitate . He may try to make sounds himself , but can not hear his own voice . However , even though he finds it difficult to speak and can not hear , he can learn to read . Nowadays such persons can also be taught to speak because we have modern methods and equipment , but we did not have these when Helen Keller was born . Even with modern methods and equipment , however , it is not easy for deaf children to learn to speak , though most of them succeed . When a child is deaf and blind as well , it becomes much more difficult , though it is possible . Helen Keller was born in 1880 . She became very ill at the age of nineteen months . Medical knowledge was not as great then as it is now . She did not die but lost her sight and hearing . As a result , she became dumb as well . Her parents did their best to teach her , but she could n ' t speak by the age of six . Then , in 1887 , a teacher , Miss Sullivan , came to live with her . Miss Sullivan herself had been blind . She had been partly cured . Though she could not see very well , she was not blind . Helen was a difficult pupil at first , but in a month Helen had learned how to understand signs and how to make them herself . At last in spite of her great difficulties , Helen learned to read , write and speak , even though she was deaf and blind . She even went to college and had full education . She wrote many books , and though other people have written books about her , her own books are the ones that best explain how it feels to be deaf , dumb and blind . Her best book is The Story of My Life . Perhaps you have read it . Though it was written in 1902 , it is still a very interesting book . Even if you have not read it , you may have heard of Helen Keller .", "questions": "A person who is deaf at birth is also dumb because", "options": {"model": ["he ca n ' t hear people", "he can not hear other people and he has nothing to imitate", "he can not hear people"], "human": ["he does n ' t like to speak", "he can not hear his own voice", "he can not hear other people and he has nothing to imitate"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
