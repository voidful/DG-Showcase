As we were sitting on the sidelines enjoying the game , a low - flying bird came swooping in attempting to land on my daughter ' s head ! It honestly came out of nowhere . We were seated by ourselves on the tree lined side of the field . I was able to calm my daughter ' s shock and fear once I showed her that the bird was not some wild animal , it was in fact , somebody ' s pet ! Now , we ' re sitting at the outdoor fields of the Pontiac Silverdome , far from any populated area , wondering where this very social cockatiel , an Australian parrot could have come from . I walked up to the bird and put out my hand . Immediately , it hopped on and chirped in a friendly way . We looked around us and knew that we could not just leave and suppose that the bird would return to where it came from . This was a very bird that needed help or it would not survive . The flag football game had ended so we walked the bird over to other groups of adults and asked if they knew of anyone who had lost a bird . All the kids were excited about the bird and fed it with some post game snacks . The bird ' s nails were getting long and he was looking pretty dirty , so we knew it had been out here for a long time and was hungry . Since its wings were clipped , it could fly a little but probably not more than 100 yards or so at a try . We all just scratched our heads as a group wondering what to do with the lost bird . We explained to the kids that this bird needed our help since it was someone ' s pet and would not know how to get its own food , and it could not fly well since its wings were clipped . The kids understood , and all of them wanted to take the bird home ! The parents however , knew this was not a good choice as one had a large dog , another two cats , etc . We explained to the kids that one of us could take the bird home for the night and then bring it to the Humane Society in the morning in hopes to connect it to its owners .
