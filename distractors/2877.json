{"id": "2877", "article": "Students who want to study in the United States may find that their chances for financial aid are limited . They often have to pay for their education with their own savings or their family ' s money . A recent report from the Institute of International Education in New York looked at 2008 - 2009 school year . Colleges and universities in the United States had more than half a million foreign students . 63 % of them paid for school mostly by themselves or with family help . 26 % percent were supported by the school they attended . There are other sources of financial aid for international students . These include a student ' s home government or university , or the United States government . Private sponsors , international organizations and employers may also provide support . Yet during the last school year , not many students were able to depend on any of these other sources . Current employers provided the most help . Still , they represented the main support for just four percent of international students . Those at the graduate level , however , are more likely than undergraduates to receive financial aid in the United States . More than 80 % percent of foreign undergraduates depended mostly on personal and family money to pay for school last year . The same was true of less than half of graduate students . Most of the others received financial aid from their college or university in the United States . A list of American schools that offer financial aid to foreign students can be found at a useful Web site . The address is edupass . org . This site also provides information about scholarship programs . But it warns foreign students not to pay if there is any charge for scholarship application forms . You could be cheated out of your money .", "questions": "The text mainly talks about", "options": {"model": ["different ways to help foreign students in the usa", "financial aid for foreign students in us"], "human": ["the hard life for foreign students in US", "financial aid for foreign students in US"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
