{"id": "2604", "article": "What will man be like in the future - - in 5 , 000 or even 50 , 000 years from now ? We can only make guesses , of course , but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today , for man is slowly changing all the time . Let us take an obvious example . Man , even five hundred years ago , was shorter than he is today . Now , on average , men are about three inches taller . Five hundred years is relatively a short period of time , so we may suppose that man will continue to grow taller . Again , in the modern world we use our brains a great deal . Even so , we still make use of only about 20 % of the brain ' s capacity . As time goes on , however , we shall have to use our brains more and more , and finally we shall need our brains more and more , and finally we shall need larger ones ! This is likely to bring a physical change too : the head , in particular the forehead , will grow larger . Nowadays our eyes are in constant use . In fact , we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses . But over long period of time it is likely that man ' s eyes will grow stronger . On the other hand , we tend to make less use of our arms and legs . These , as a result , are likely to grow weaker . At the same time , however , our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great deal in modern life . But what about hair ? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer . In the future , then , both sexes are likely to be bald . Perhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at ! This may well be true . All the same , in spite of all these changes , future man will still have a lot in common with us . He will still be a human being , with thoughts and motions similar to our own .", "questions": "The change in man ' s size of the forehead is probably because", "options": {"model": ["he will use his brain more and more as time goes on", "the brain ' s capacity will be grown larger in the future", "his brain will grow larger in the future", "his brain has grown larger over the past"], "human": ["he makes use of only 20 % of the brain ' s capacity", "his brain has grown larger over the past centuries", "the other 80 % of his brain will grow in due time", "he will use his brain more and more as time goes on"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
