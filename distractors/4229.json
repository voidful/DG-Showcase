{"id": "4229", "article": "You will have a lot of reading to do in this grade this year . You can do more of it in less time if you learn to read rapidly . Perhaps you have been told about some habits which keep a person from reading fast and have been strongly asked to break those which you might have . Do you still have any of these bad habits ? Check yourself by answering \" yes \" or \" no \" to these questions . ( 1 ) Do you move your lips when reading silently ? ( 2 ) Do you point to words with your finger as you read ? ( 3 ) Do you move your head from side to side as you read ? ( 4 ) Do you read one word at a time ? If you answer \" yes \" to any of these questions , start at once to break the habit . If you move your lips , hold your fingers over them , or hold a piece of paper between your lips while you are reading . Then if your lips move , you will know it and can stop them . If you point to words , hold the two sides of your book , one side with your left hand , the other side with your right hand . Then you wo n ' t have a free finger to use in pointing while reading . If you move your head , place your chin in one hand and hold your head still . If you read no more than one or two three words at a time , you need to work very hard in learning to take in more words at each glance as your eyes travel across the lines of words . Even if you do rather fast now , you can learn to read even faster . As you probably have been told , the fast reading is to take in whole groups of words as each glance . Read in thought groups and force your eyes along the lines of words as fast as you can make them go . Anyone who practices doing these things will be able to read faster", "questions": "The best title for this passage is", "options": {"model": ["what to read", "how to read rapidly", "what is reading"], "human": ["What to read", "Ways to read less in more time", "How to read rapidly"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
