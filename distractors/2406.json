{"id": "2406", "article": "Although hurricane season does n ' t begin until June 1 , a Pacific storm has already struck . El Salvador , which was ruined by a Caribbean storm in 1995 , was hit by Hurricane Adrian on Friday . This is the first Pacific - born hurricane to ever reach land in this Central American country . Some 14 , 000 people left from the western coast of El Salvador . The storm weakened as it crossed land , heading east . Heavy rains created deadly flooding problems in the hurricane ' s wake . Adrian is the first Pacific storm of the season . It reported maximum continuous winds of 75 miles per hour , the minimum strength of a hurricane . A Category 3 hurricane , Adrian also caused damage and flooding in Honduras . It is expected to break up before reaching the Caribbean Sea on the eastern coast of Central America . Hurricane season typically begins June 1 and lasts through November 30 . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) has predicted seven to nine hurricanes for the 2005 season . \" It is difficult to make any kind of an exact prediction of how many of these will strike land , \" NOAA administrator Conrad Lautenbacher said . He predicts two to three hurricanes will strike the U . S . this season . Last year , six of nine hurricanes reached Category 3 strength or higher . Four of those hit Florida within a six - week period . Altogether , Hurricanes Charley , Frances , Ivan , and Jeanne caused more than $ 40 billion in damage in the Sunshine State . This year ' s forecast is based on ocean temperatures . Warmer temperatures produce more tropical storms , which can then turn into hurricanes . \" The issue , really , this year is the unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic , \" said Frank Lepore of the National Hurricane Center .", "questions": "We can infer that warmer ocean temperatures", "options": {"model": ["will lead to the hurricanes", "will lead to the hurricanes in the usa", "are mo re likely to cause the hurricanes"], "human": ["have nothing to do with the hurricane", "cause less hurricane", "are mo re likely to cause the hurricanes"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
