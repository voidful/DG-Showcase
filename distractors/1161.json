{"id": "1161", "article": "There are many theories about how drama came into being in ancient Greece . The one most widely accepted today is based on the assumption that drama developed gradually from ceremonies . The argument for this view goes as follows . In the beginning , human beings viewed the natural forces of the world as unpredictable , and they sought through various means to control these unknown powers . Those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then kept and repeated until they hardened into fixed ceremonies . Eventually stories arose which explained the mysteries of the ceremonies . As time passed , some of them were abandoned , but the stories , later called myths , provided materials for art and drama Those who believe that drama came out of ceremonies also argue that those ceremonies contained the seed of theater because music , dance , and masks were almost always used . In addition , there were performers , and , since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in the rules of ceremonies , religious leaders usually assumed that task . Wearing masks , they often impersonated other people , animals , or supernatural beings , and performed the desired effect by gestures - - success in hunt or battle , the coming rain , the revival of the Sun - - as an actor might . Eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities . Another theory finds out the theater came from the human Interest in storytelling . According to this view , tales ( about the hunt , war , or other events ) are gradually formed , at first through the use of impersonation , action , and dialogue by a speaker and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person A closely related theory about drama _ those dances that are primarily rhythmical and gymnastic or that are imitations of animal movements and sounds .", "questions": "We can infer from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["all measures could n ' t bring the desired results", "it was impossible to control the process of the drama", "wearing masks can help to control the natural force of the world", "modern drama is better than the modern dance"], "human": ["religious leaders usually did n ' t perform in the ceremonies", "mistakes are unavoidable in the religious ceremonies", "performers usually used languages to reach the desired results", "all measures could n ' t bring the desired results"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
