{"id": "1769", "article": "The economy has developed a lot while the Internet is still not fully used in China . A study shows that about two - thirds of typical Chinese Internet users use the computer for news , often entertainment - related , or for online games , music or movies , all can be downloaded for free . Most prefers messages to e - mail , seldom makes online shopping at all . Although they are now depending on the Internet more often than before to communicate with others who have the same professions , hobbies and political interests , online shopping still remains unpopular in China . Three - quarters of users surveyed have never bought anything over the Internet , and only 10 percent do shopping even once a month . Among those who do buy online , most pay for entertainment while others buy phone cards , or computer hardware or software . \" Many people do n ' t trust the quality of goods bought online , \" the researcher said , \" If they buy it in a store and do n ' t like it , they can easily bring it back . \" The survey was done in Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou , Chengdu and Changsha . Results do not necessarily project countrywide because Internet use in the countryside is lower than in cities . The study showed that the typical netizens in the five cities are richer and more highly educated . Males make up two - thirds of the group , and more than 80 percent of users are under 24 . Surprisingly , with the ages increase , the percentage decreases . China has more than 200 million people online , however , forty - two percent say they do not use search engines . Others seek entertainment news , as well as information useful for work or study on line . Baidu . com was used by half of those surveyed , compared with a quarter for Google , the leading search engine in the United States .", "questions": "The passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["internet use in china", "china ' s internet"], "human": ["shopping online", "Internet use in China"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
