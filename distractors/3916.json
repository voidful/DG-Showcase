{"id": "3916", "article": "Babies understand what their mothers say , even when they speak a language their children have never heard before , scientists claim . The researchers found that one - year - olds reacted in exactly same way to their mothers ' voices regardless of whether they were speaking English or Greek , showing what mothers have long known - that babies pick up on tone of voice rather than the words themselves . The researchers , from Cardiff University ' s School of Psychology , observed babies as they watched their mothers perform actions with toys using the English words \" whoops \" and \" there \" . The scientists studied reactions from one - year - old babies to their mums ' voices even when they were speaking both English and Greek , and keeping the same tone of voice . The academics found that babies reproduced the same reactions regardless of whether they knew the language . Study leader Dr Merideth Gattis of Cardiff University ' s School of Psychology says , \" What this work showed was that children could have access to understanding simply through tone of voice . We did ' whoops ' and ' there ' in two languages and got exactly the same results . \" The research , published in the journal Cognitive Development , was conducted on 84 babies aged between 14 and 18 months , over the course of a year , with none of the babies having any previous exposure to Greek . Dr Gattis says that children respond to tone clues in their parents ' voices from an early age . She says , \" Tone of voice is a really useful signal of what someone is thinking . We never have direct access to other people ' s minds , except the signals in language that they give out . \" She says the study shows that it is less important what parents say than how they say it . Dr Gattis adds , \" A child may ask if you like his / her drawing , for example . You might say yes , but if you do n ' t sound enthusiastic , the meaning may not get across . \" Before children begin to speak , parents should use exaggerated tone when speaking to them .", "questions": "Which of the following is TRUE , according to the study ?", "options": {"model": ["the babies acted the same way regardless of the language .", "the babies were born to their mother ' s speech .", "the research was carried out by the researchers .", "the children could n ' t understand the meaning of the language ."], "human": ["Tone of voice is the most useful sign of what someone is thinking .", "After children begin to speak , tone becomes unimportant .", "The research was conducted on 48 babies .", "The babies acted the same way regardless of the language ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
