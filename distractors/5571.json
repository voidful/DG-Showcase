{"id": "5571", "article": "Most people know that awkward feeling when you step into an elevator with other people and try not to make eye contact . But new research suggests it may be down to a subconscious power struggle being played out as you make your way up or down . A study found that people decide where they stand based on a micro social grading , established within seconds of entering the lift . Rebekah Rousi , a Ph . D . student in cognitive science , conducted an study of elevator behaviour in two of the tallest office buildings in Adelaide , Australia . As part of her research , she took a total of 30 lift rides in the two buildings , and discovered there was an established order to where people tended stand . In a blog , she writes that more senior men seemed to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins . She said : ' In front of them were younger men , and in front of them were women of all ages . ' She also noticed there was a difference in where people directed their stare half way through the ride . Men watched the monitors , looked in the side mirrors ( in one building ) to see themselves , and in the door mirrors ( of the other building ) to also watch others . ' Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users ( unless in conversation ) and the mirrors , ' she writes . The student concluded it could be that people who are shyer stand toward the front , where they ca n ' t see other passengers , whereas brave people stand in the back , where they have a view of everyone else .", "questions": "Why do women choose to stand in the front ?", "options": {"model": ["because they are too shy to make eye contact with others .", "because they do n ' t like to watch other people ."], "human": ["Because they want to watch the monitors .", "Because they are too shy to make eye contact with others ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
