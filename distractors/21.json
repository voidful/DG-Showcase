{"id": "21", "article": "Small talk is part of everyday life , but it ' s the deep conversations that may make you happy . That ' s one possibility suggested in a new study which examined how conversation is related to happiness . Researchers , led by Matthias Mehl at the University of Arizona , looked at the different types of conversation that happy and unhappy people participate in . The study , published in the journal Psychological Science , was somewhat small , involving 79 undergraduates , but meshes well with established ideas that happiness and social life are connected . Experts found that the happiest people in the study engaged in 33 % more small talk than the unhappiest participants . Happy people tended to have twice as many deep conversations , and spent 25 percent less time alone than the unhappiest participants . These insights fit with what psychologists have seen previously : that loneliness leads to depression , and that feelings of social connectedness are important for happiness , said Susan Turk Charles , a psychologist at the University of California , who was not involved in the study . Deep conversations create a feeling of belonging that leads to happiness , she said . On the contrary , people who suffer from depression tend to withdraw from others . The method that the researchers used was creative , Charles said . Instead of bringing people into a lab , as is traditionally done in these sorts of studies , they had participants wear a recording device for four days , picking up conversations that they had . The recorder sampled 30 seconds of sound every 12 . 5 minutes , giving researchers a broad range of conversations to examine in terms of \" small talk \" vs . \" deep conversation \" . The bottom line is that maintaining friendships can help with emotional well - being ( , ) . Friends buffer the effects of negative events and provide support , Charles said . Do n ' t be too busy to have a deep conversation , she said . \" It really is important . It should be something that you should pay just as much attention to as your career , \" she said .", "questions": "According to Charles ,", "options": {"model": ["small talk is more important than the unhappiest people", "deep talks can make people happier", "deep conversations can make people happy", "small talk is a part of everyday life"], "human": ["small talk is not important", "people are too busy to have deep conversations", "people that make small talk often suffer from depression", "deep conversations can make people happy"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
