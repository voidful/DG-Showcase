{"id": "2907", "article": "Even if we have an extremely healthy diet and lifestyle , the human body is programmed to wear out at a maximum of about 120 years , and usually less . We all have a biological clock inside us which determines the moment when our organs cease to function properly . This is because our cells have stopped renewing themselves and our body can no longer repair itself . This is also the moment when we are more likely to begin to suffer from the diseases of old age such as arthritis and Alzheimer ' s . However , rapid advances in DNA research are beginning to throw light on the secrets of the ageing process . By the end of this century we could literally have the power of life over death . Although it has long been accepted that humans have a fixed lifespan , it is also a fact that certain other organisms , such as reptiles and amphibians , appear to _ . The only reason we do not see 500 - year - old alligators is because in the wild their lives are always in danger , from man , from pollution and from other animals . When they are kept in zoos they do not seem to age at all after they are fully grown . The same is true of some species of fish , which grow indefinitely and show no signs of ageing . The existence of animals with no fixed lifespan seems to indicate that an age gene really does exist . It is this gene which scientists are searching for , which may delay or repair damage to the body caused by ageing . Another new area of research involves the oxidation theory , which says that ageing is caused by the same process that makes iron rust . In controlled experiments , the lifespans of certain animals were shown to be lengthened with anti - oxidants ; for example , the lifespan of mice can be increased by 30 % . Antioxidants are already being used in face creams and other cosmetics , and they are likely to play an important part in keeping people physically young . Perhaps the most immediate advance we are likely to see in the battle to halt the ageing process will be organ replacement . By the year 2020 it is likely that we will be replacing injured bones or even organs like livers and kidneys with ones \" grown \" in laboratories .
