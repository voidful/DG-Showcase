{"id": "221", "article": "Traditional fairytales are being given up by parents because they are too scary for their young children , a study found . Research uncovered that one in five parents has got rid of old literature such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Rapunzel in favour of more modem books . One third of parents said their children have been left in tears after hearing the _ details of Little Red Riding Hood . And nearly half of mothers and fathers refuse to read Rumplesliltshin to their kids as the themes of the story are kidnapping and killing . Similarly , Goldilocks and the Three Bears was also a tale likely to be left on the book shelf as parents felt it forgives stealing . The survey of 2 , 000 adults was completed to mark the launch of the hit US drama GRIMM , which starts tonight at 9 pm on Watch , and sees six drama series based on traditional fairytales . The survey found a quarter of parents questioned would n ' t consider reading fairytales to their kids . And 52 percent of the parents said Cinderella did n ' t send a good message to their children as it describes a young woman doing housework all day . Steve Hornsey , General Manager of Watch , said : \" Bedtime stories are supposed to calm children down and send them off to sleep soundly . But as we see in GMMM , fairytales can be dark and dramatic so it ' s understandable that parents worry about reading them to young ' children . As adults we can see the innocence in fairytales , but a five - year - old child could take them too literally . Despite the dark nature of classic fairytales , as : we see in GRIMM , good will defeat evil and there is always a moral to the story . \" The study also found two thirds of mums and dads try to avoid Stories which might give their children nightmares . However half of parents said traditional tales are \" more likely to have a strong moral message than a lot of modem kids ' books , such as The Gruffato , The Hungary Caterpillar and the Mr Men books .", "questions": "A quarter of parents were unwilling to read fairy tales i d their children because", "options": {"model": ["their children could n ' t understand it", "the fairytales were too dangerous", "their children would ask too many strange questions"], "human": ["their children were too young to understand them", "fairy tales were not suitable for young children", "their children would ask too many strange questions"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
