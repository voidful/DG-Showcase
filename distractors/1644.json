When he arrived , he bounced happily up the stairs to the doorway of the house . He looked through the doorway with his ears lifted high and his tail wagging as fast as it could . To his great surprise , he found himself staring at 1 , 000 other happy little dogs with their tails wagging just as his . He smiled a great smile , and was answered with 1 , 000 great smiles just as warm and friendly . As he left the house , he thought to himself , \" This is a wonderful place . I will come back and visit often . \" In this same village , another little dog , who was not quite as happy as the first one , decided to visit the house . He slowly climbed the stairs and hung his head low as he looked into the door . When he saw the 1 , 000 unfriendly looking dogs staring back at him , he growled at them and was horrified to see 1 , 000 little dogs growling back at him . As he left , he thought to himself , \" This is a horrible place , and I will never go back there again . \" All the faces in the world are mirrors .
