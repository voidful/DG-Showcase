Sometimes the weaknesses seem to outweigh the strengths and sometimes it ' s the other way around . Some people get sick easily . Some struggle to manage their finances properly .

Eastburn has no arms or legs and yet is an inspirational speaker and find still manage to achieve tremendous things . They rise above their weaknesses and do not allow limit their possibilities . I attended a school prize - giving ceremony not so long ago and the guest speaker was Andrew Becroft , who had a severe stutter as a child . Instead of allowing this to limit him , he chose to work hard to overcome it . He is now the Principal Youth Court Judge for New Zealand . Not only did he become successful , but he did so in a profession where he had to speak in front of others regularly where his weakness is front and center for all to see . If he had n ' t worked on his speaking ability , it would have been very limiting to his life and career prospects . You can find similar people on New Zealand News channels , and I suspect the same in other countries . There are a number of presenters and reporters who have a noticeably unusual manner of speaking . Perhaps they have a peculiar accent or pitch of voice . These people have succeeded in spite of what would appear to be a weakness in their profession . Lots of people face far more significant limitations than you do .

But no matter what the limitation , you will always find people who have overcome it .", "questions": "Which of the following about Andrew Becroft is NOT right according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["he is a member of the school prize - giving ceremony .", "he is good at speaking .", "he has a severe stutter ."], "human": ["He is now the Principal Youth Court Judge for New Zealand .", "His weakness is no longer a restriction to his life and career prospects .", "He has a severe stutter ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
