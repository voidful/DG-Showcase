{"id": "604", "article": "Chinese and Western eating habits are different . In China , the dishes are placed on the table and everybody shares . It is always polite to let guests or elderly people at the table taste every dish first . But in the West , everyone has his or her own plate of food . Although there are no strict rules on how to set chopsticks and spoons , there are some things you should never do during a Chinese banquet . Firstly and most importantly , do n ' t put your chopsticks upright in the rice bowl . Instead , lay them on your dish . The reason for this is that when people die , family members give them a bowl full of rice with a pair of chopsticks sticking out upright in it . So if you stick your chopsticks in the rice bowl , it appears that you want someone at the table to die . Make sure the spout of the teapot is not facing anyone , as this is impolite . The spout should always be directed to where nobody is sitting , usually just outward from the table . Do n ' t tap on your bowl with your chopsticks . Beggars tap on their bowls , so this is not polite . Also , when the food is coming too slow in a restaurant , you should not tap on your bowl . If you are in someone ' s home , it is like the cook .", "questions": "Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["never tap on your bowls with the chopsticks during the meal .", "you ca n ' t put your chopsticks in the rice bowl .", "do n ' t put your chopsticks onto your bowl .", "it ' s impolite to use the chopsticks in the food ."], "human": ["It is polite to taste the dishes before the guests or the elderly .", "You can put your chopsticks wherever you want .", "Teenagers can stick their chopsticks in the rice bowl .", "Never tap on your bowls with the chopsticks during the meal ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
