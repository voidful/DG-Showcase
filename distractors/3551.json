But there are a few things in life I ' d probably do differently if I had the chance . I once majored in architecture - - something I had been crazy about for as long as I could remember - - and then I suddenly had a change of heart . I made an appointment with my adviser , and told him I was no longer certain I wanted to pursue a career in architecture . \" Do n ' t give up on your childhood dream ! \" \" He ' s right , \" I thought . \" I should just stick it out and I should n ' t disappoint the little girl who once loved architecture . \" It was awful . I was _ , holding on to a childhood dream that had long since faded . When I talked with a friend about it a year later , he asked : \" Right now , what do you want to do with your life ? \" That ' s when I came to the realization that dreams change over time and that you should give up the childhood dream if it ' s not what you want as an adult . Luckily , it was n ' t too late . After some serious thought , I changed my major to journalism . It was n ' t something I had always imagined myself pursuing - - but at that moment , it was what I wanted . We grow up , and sometimes our dreams change - - and that ' s perfectly OK .
