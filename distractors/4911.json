{"id": "4911", "article": "Mr . Perkin did not like to be different from other people , so he always tried to wear the same clothes , eat the same food , and do the same things after work as others . One day Mr . Perkin stood at the bus - stop . As he watched the cars go by , he noticed that many of them were new Beta 400s and most of them were yellow . The following week , Mr . Perkin bought a new bright yellow Beta 400s . He was very pleased with it , and drove to work in it the next day . He was even more pleased with his new car , when he saw all the other Beta 400s , in front , behind , and on both sides of him . Mr . Perkin parked his car near his office , and walked the rest of the way . But when he came back at five o ' clock , there were so many bright yellow Beta 400s that Mr . Perkin did n ' t know which car was his . He tried his key in some of the cars , but people gave him a strange look which he did n ' t like , so he stopped . Poor Mr . Perkin had to wait nearly two hours until there was only one yellow Beta 400S left .", "questions": "Mr .
