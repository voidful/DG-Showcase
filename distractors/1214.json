{"id": "1214", "article": "London , Reuters - - What could annoy teenagers enough to make them stop hanging out with friends and go home ? No , it ' s not a visit from their mothers , and not a threat to take away their cellphones or pocket money . It ' s high - frequency noise . The UK police recently agreed to use a device called the Sonic Teenager Deterrent . It sends out a sound that makes teenagers become so impatient and angry that they have to cover their ears tightly and walk away . The sound is at extreme high - pitch that can be heard by those under 20 . The body ' s natural ability to detect some wave bands decreases almost entirely after 20 , so few adults can hear the sounds . The black - box device , nicknamed the Mosquito because of its sound , can be fixed to the outside walls of shops , offices and homes . It sounds to youngsters like a crazy insect or a badly played violin . But it causes no physical damage . A number of police forces and councils have given permission to use the system and want to install it at trouble spots . Staffordshire Police Inspector Amanda Davies , who has given the device to shopkeepers in the Moorlands area , said , \" It is controlled by the shopkeepers - - if they can see through their window that there is a problem , they turn the device on for a while until the group has run away . \"", "questions": "From the passage we can know that", "options": {"model": ["high - frequency noise can be used as a device", "high - frequency noise is beyond the listening ability of people over 20"], "human": ["the police invented a new device to deal with teenagers", "high - frequency noise is beyond the listening ability of people over 20"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
