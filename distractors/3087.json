{"id": "3087", "article": "When the US started the war in Iraq a year ago , Spain was a firm supporter . But on April 18 , the Spanish government started to remove its troops , becoming the first country in the US - led coalition to bring its soldiers home . The person behind this surprise move is the new Spanish prime minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero . A few months ago , he was hardly known outside his small hometown in northern Spain . Even a week before last month ' s general election , Zapatero was still considered an outsider for the top job . But just three days before the vote , a series of bomb attacks on three train stations in Madrid killed 191 people and injured some 1 , 900 . It was Spain ' s worst ever terrorist attack and it changed everything - - even making Zapatero prime minister . From the beginning , the 43 - year - old former lawyer , knew the weaknesses of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and his hand - picked successor , Mariano Rajoy . About 90 per cent of the Spanish people were against the war in Iraq and were unhappy that Aznar had taken them into it . So Zapatero promised : \" If this party wins the election and the UN still ca n ' t take charge in Iraq , the new government will pull its 1 , 400 troops out of Iraq . \" Despite focusing on this and other Aznar mistakes , Zapatero ' s chances of victory were still thin until the Madrid bombings . At first , the government blamed ETA , a separatist terror group from the Basque region of northern Spain . But later evidence suggested the attack was carried out by al - Qaida members angry at Spain ' s presence in Iraq . The people were upset , and they showed this by voting for Zapatero . Many accused the government of covering up information about the bombings and only blaming ETA so it would n ' t lose to an anti - war vote . In a move that was as shocking to the world as his election victory , Zapatero chose to carry out his promise the day after he took office . And its effect could be long - lasting . As the situation in Iraq worsens , several countries are considering their positions .", "questions": "What do you think would probably happen after Sapin ' s move out of Iraq .", "options": {"model": ["some more countries would bring their troops home .", "zapatri would be in charge of the government for the election .", "the spanish government would close its control over the war .", "the spanish government would take the place of the us ."], "human": ["There would be more terrorist attacks in Spain .", "The US would also follow Spain ' s lead and pull their armies out of Iraq .", "The situation in Iraq would become better after Spain ' s move .", "Some more countries would bring their troops home ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
