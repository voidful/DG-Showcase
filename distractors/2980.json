{"id": "2980", "article": "Time and how we experience it have always puzzled us . Physicists have created fascinating theories , but their time is measured by a pendulum and is not psychological time , which leaps with little regard to the clock or calendar . As some - one who understood the distinction observed , \" _ Psychologists have long noticed that larger units of time , such as months and years , fly on swifter wings as we age . They also note that the more time is structured with schedules and appointments , the more rapidly it seems to pass . For example , a day at the office flies compared with a day at the beach . Since most of us spend fewer days at the beach and more at the office as we age , an increase in structured tune could well be to blame for why time seems to speed up as we grow older .

To counter this , try to find ways to interrupt the structure of your day - - to stop time , so to speak . Learning something new is one of the ways to slow the passage of time . One of the reasons the days of our youth seems so full and long is that these are the days of learning and discovery .
