Knowing the importance of daily matters is the first step towards good time management . Write down the things that you want to do and organize them according to their level of importance . The important thing should be done first . If there are too many things that have to be done in one day , then you have to give up doing something that is less important on your list . Besides this , you need to spend a specific amount of time doing all the activities you have written down and make sure you finish them on time . People often slow down in their work even though they know that time will never wait for them . Make sure you keep to your plan and finish the tasks one by one . Do not try to do too many things at once . Also , you can group similar activities together and do them one by one . For example , you can group all the tasks you need to do in the office together and do them while you ' re in office . Do all the tasks that have to be done in one place first , and then move to the next place to do the other tasks . \" The bad news is that time flies .
