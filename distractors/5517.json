{"id": "5517", "article": "An old man went to live with his son , daughter - in - law , and a four - year - old grandson . The family ate together at the dinner table . But the elderly grandfather ' s shaky hands and failing sight made eating rather difficult . Peas rolled onto the floor . When he took the glass , often milk spilled on the tablecloth . The son and daughter - in - law became unhappy with _ . So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner . There , grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table . Since grandfather had broken a dish or two , his food was served in a wooden bowl . Sometimes when the family glanced in grandfather ' s direction , he had a tear in his eyes as he ate alone . Still , the couple blamed him sharply when he dropped a fork or spilled food . The four - year - old son watched it all in silence . One evening , the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor . He asked the child , \" What are you making ? \" The boy responded , \" Oh , I am making a little bowl for you and mama to eat your food from when I grow up . \" The words so struck the parents that they were speechless . Then tears started to stream down their cheeks . Though no word was spoken , both knew what must be done . That evening the husband took grandfather ' s hand and gently led him back to the family table . For the rest of his days he ate every meal with the family . And for some reason , neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped , milk spilled , or the tablecloth soiled . Children are surprisingly _ . Their eyes always observe , their ears always listen , and their minds always process the messages they get . If they see us patiently provide a happy home atmosphere for family members , they will imitate that attitude for the rest of their lives . The wise parent realizes that every day is being laid for the child ' s future .", "questions": "Why were there tears in the old man ' s eyes ?", "options": {"model": ["because his son did n ' t eat out .", "because he did n ' t see his son eating alone .", "because he was made to eat alone ."], "human": ["Because he was n ' t given enough food to eat .", "Because his son did n ' t allow him to live with them .", "Because he was made to eat alone ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
