{"id": "1023", "article": "In eighteen seventy - seven , the American government decided to move the Nez Perce Indians from their land . The government had set up a reservation for them in Idaho . Chief Joseph did not want to leave the land . It was holy ground . It contained the bones of his father and mother . But , like his father in earlier times , Chief Joseph knew it would be hopeless to stay and defend the land . There were too few Indians to win a war against the white men . And so in June of eighteen seventy - seven , the Nez Perce left their home in the Wallowa Valley . They left quickly . They were able to take only a small part of what they owned , and just a few cattle and Appaloosa horses . When the Indians reached the Snake River , the water was very deep and ran very fast with melted snow from the mountains . Chief Joseph and his people made boats from sticks and dried animal skins to cross the river . While the Indians were busy , a group of white men came and stole some of the cattle waiting at the edge of the river . The other chiefs demanded that Joseph call a meeting . Two of the chiefs , White Bird and Toohoolhoolzote , spoke for War , but Joseph held different opinion . Some of the young men in White Bird ' s group were very angry . That night , they rode into the countryside and killed eleven white persons . During all his years as chief , Joseph had tried to keep the peace . Now he saw there was no hope . Although he and his young men had taken no part in the killings , he knew that the white men would blame all of the Indians . Chief Joseph said , \" I would have given my own life if I could have undone the killing of the white men . \" Many Nez Perce fled . Chief Joseph remained , because his wife was about to have a baby . After she gave birth , he and his family joined the others in White Bird Canyon to the south . Joseph wanted to lead the people to safety in the flat lands of Montana . But the United States army quickly sent horse soldiers to follow them . They were extremely tired when they reached White Bird Canyon . An Indian - - carrying a white flag - - walked forward to meet them . A soldier shot him . With that shot , war between the Nez Perce and the United States began .", "questions": "What might be the title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the government ' s decision to move the nez perce from their land", "the history of the nez perce .", "the story of chief joseph"], "human": ["Chief Joseph and his children", "The Nez Perce Indians", "The story of Chief Joseph"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
