{"id": "5326", "article": "What do Tom Sawyer and Jumping Frogs have in common ? Stories about both of them were created by one man : Mark Twain . Twain was four years old when his family moved to Hannibal , Missouri , located on the west bank of the Mississippi . Twain grew up there and was fascinated with ( . . . . . . ) life along the river - - - - the steamboats , the giant lumber rafts , and the people who worked on them . The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County is one of Twain ' s best loved short stories , and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is one of his most famous novels . Both these works are celebrated by events held during National Tom Sawyer Days , which originated in the late 1950s and became national in the 1960s . Children enter their frogs in the jumping contest during National Tom Sawyer Days . There ' s also a fence painting contest to see who can paint the fastest . The idea for this contest comes from a scene in Tom Sawyer , in which Tom has been told to paint the fence in front of the house he lives in . It ' s a beautiful day , and he would rather be doing anything else . As his friends walk by , he makes them believe that it ' s fun to paint , and they join in the \" fun \" . By the end of the day , the fence has three coats of paint ! Although the story of Tom Sawyer is a fiction , it ' s based on facts . If you go to Hannibal , you ' ll see the white fence , which still stands at Twain ' s boyhood home .", "questions": "From the white fence at Twain ' s boyhood home , we know that", "options": {"model": ["twain is tom sawyer ' s father", "tom sawyer is twain ' s most popular story .", "tom sawyer is based on twain ' s experiences .", "the story of tom sawyer is based partly on twain ' s experiences ."], "human": ["the story of Tom Sawyer is based totally on Twain ' s imagination .", "Twain ' s old house is painted by the fence painting competitors .", "Twain ' s old house is visited by people from all over the country .", "the story of Tom Sawyer is based partly on Twain ' s experiences ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
