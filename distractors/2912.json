{"id": "2912", "article": "The advantages of using flashcards to build up a vocabulary are well known . You can buy sets of cards , or make your own , and carry them with you wherever you go . There ' s no question this is useful and because you can use them in short bursts , it ' s not too much for you . It can be fun . I do n ' t recommend drilling for hours at a time with flashcards . If you want to use flashcard software , things get even better . There are many packages out there for maintaining and drilling flashcards . I recommend VTrain though there are many others . One stands out , however : SuperMemo . Similar to Pimsleur , SuperMemo is engineered according to a carefully researched methodology in order to test you on a card the very minimum number of times you need to see it for it to stick . When you look at a card , you give some feedback to the software on whether you got it right and how easy you found it . It uses this information , and that of your previous attempts , to decide when you will be shown the card next . It ' s smart and it really works . If you ' re like me , the news is even better ! I have a version of SuperMemo that runs on my PalmOS phone . Wherever I am , if I have my phone handy , I have thousands of flashcards with me too . Honestly , it would be worth purchasing a cheap Palm device only for this . You can pick one up for $ 20 or even less on eBay or elsewhere . Consider it , at least .", "questions": "With SuperMemo , whether the next card will be shown depends on", "options": {"model": ["the feedback one gives to the credit card", "the amount of time one uses to use the software", "the feedback one gives to the software"], "human": ["the time you look at the card", "the times one attempts to do with a card", "the feedback one gives to the software"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
