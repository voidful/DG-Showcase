{"id": "3203", "article": "For a long time , the traditional method of identifying liars was to watch their body language , including facial expressions . What if the person appears to be nervous ? Is the person unable to look me in the eye ? Is he or she look around the room ? What about other nervous movements , such as fidgeting or shifting from side to side ? Many people - - from parents to police officers and airport security personnel - - depend on this method . But does a person ' s body and face reveal the truth ? Not according to a new study . Talking , it seems , is the best way to smoke out a liar . That is what researchers in the United Kingdom found out recently . Their investigation took place at one place where lying can get you into big trouble - - an airport . The researchers asked volunteers to pretend they were real passengers and then lie to airport security agents . Some of the agents used spoke conversation - based methods to question these make - believe passengers . Others depended instead on the person ' s body language , like lack of eye contact and showing signs of nervousness . The agents talking with the passengers were 20 times more likely to catch the liars . The study found that these conversation - based techniques can help you recognize when a person is lying to you . Like many methods , this conversation method has a name . It is called Controlled Cognitive Engagement or CCE , for short . The British government partly financed this study . The American Psychological ( APA ) published the findings . Body language can not be trusted . Using body language and facial expressions to catch someone in a lie is really hard . And it only works , seemingly , by chance . Thomas Ormerod is the head of the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex in England . On the APA website , he reported that the \" suspicious - signs method \" - - or using body language - - \" almost completely fails \" in finding lies .", "questions": "What should volunteers in the investigation do ?", "options": {"model": ["act as passengers as researchers required .", "take place at one place where lying can get you into trouble ."], "human": ["Pretend to be airport security agents .", "Act as passengers as researchers required ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
