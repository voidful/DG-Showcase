{"id": "1827", "article": "Do you know what Fear and Faith have in common ? Fear believes in a negative future . Faith believes in a positive future . Both believe in something that has not yet happened . So I ask you , if neither the positive nor negative future has happened yet then why not choose to believe in the positive future ? I believe during these challenging times we have a choice between two roads : the positive road and the negative road . And our bus ca n ' t be on two roads at the same time . So we have to make a choice and this choice determines our belief about the future and the attitude and actions we bring to the present . I ' m not saying we should n ' t have any fear . There are times when fear is a gift . A healthy dose of fear causes us to examine our situation and plan for the future . It moves us to smell the cheese and expect change . When used wisely it allows us to manage risk and make better decisions . Some fear is good . However , what I have observed lately is a supersized , huge dose of fear that is spreading the hearts and minds of far too many people . This oversized fear is causing leaders and their organizations to either act unreasonably or to not act at all . They are either hurrying in a million different directions because of fear . In both cases , fear is leading them to take the negative road to failure . The answer is the positive road paved with faith and a belief that your best days are not behind you but ahead of you . With this belief you make the right choices and actions today that will create your positive future tomorrow . You stay calm , focused and committed to your purpose . You look for ways to save money and cut costs without making unreasonable fear - based decisions that sacrifice your future success . You identify opportunities in the midst of the challenges and you focus on solutions instead of problems . Your faith and belief in a positive future leads to powerful actions today . The future has not happened yet and you have a say in what it looks like by the way you think and act . Fear or Faith . The choice is yours .", "questions": "If we have faith in future , we will", "options": {"model": ["take powerful actions today", "have a positive future"], "human": ["have the best days ahead of us", "take powerful actions today"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
