{"id": "179", "article": "Traveling can be a very fun and exciting way to vacation with your family , but it does not always turn out as expected . I have traveled a lot with my family over the years , but some experiences are worth forgetting altogether . I remember a particular traveling experience which sticks out in my mind for the wrong reasons . My dad and stepmom had decided to drive to California for our family vacation . This was supposed to provide educational value , since we would be able to stop along the way and look at various sites in each state . Everything was going as planned until we decided to take a break and stop at the Grand Canyon . I had always wanted to see this exciting place and had decided to write a report on it for my eight - grade English class . We got out of the car and were walking on one of the paths to get to a cliff so we could take a family photo when I slipped and fell down . I fell on a piece of rock , and felt great pain run up my leg at once . My dad took me to the nearest hospital and , after an eight - hour wait in the emergency room , found out that I broke two bones in my foot . Needless to say , our vacation was no fun for me because I was in pain during the whole two - week trip . I ended up making an appointment the day we got home to see a doctor for a check - up . That was definitely not what I consider fun or a great vacation , and it really _ our sightseeing plans .", "questions": "The author slipped and fell down when he was", "options": {"model": ["taking a family picture", "walking on a path to a cliff"], "human": ["taking a photo of his family", "walking on a path to a cliff"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
