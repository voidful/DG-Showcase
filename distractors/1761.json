{"id": "1761", "article": "About 90 percent of Chinese believe the polarization between the rich and poor is \" serious \" in China , according to a survey conducted by China Youth Daily . And more than 80 percent of the respondents surveyed said something must be done to narrow the expanding gap between the rich and poor , while 14 . 1 percent said it was necessary . The polarization has aroused wide concern among the public in recent years . The State Development and Reform Commission said the _ had reached 0 . 47 for China , up from o . 29 two decades ago . Usually , a country with a number above 0 . 4 is warned to pay attention to the income inequality problem . To find out the people ' s view , the survey covered 10 , 250 respondents , between the ages of 20 and 30 with a college education and a monthly salary between 1 , 000 and 3 , 000 yuan . Surprisingly , most disagreed with the view of experts who claim the urban - rural difference is causing the widening gap . More than 70 percent of the respondents believed that \" the group of special interests \" is the prime reason for the polarization , followed by \" people in power \" 68 percent , and \" bosses \" 50 percent . Another unexpected finding is that almost all agreed that a good educational background and knowledge were not the decisive factors in gaining wealth . About 95 percent said rich people are not necessarily those who are able to speak English or have a college education . Today in China , rich people , accounting for 10 percent of the population , control 45 percent of the total social fortune , and poor people , also 10 percent of the population , only control 1 . 5 percent , according to an investigation published by the National Bureau of Statistics last June .", "questions": "What ' s the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the causes and differences of the polarization", "the causes and differences of the polarization between the rich and poor", "rich - poor divide serious , study finds"], "human": ["Close the Gap between the Rich and Poor", "Surveys conducted by China Youth Daily", "Rich - Poor Divide Serious , Study Finds"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
