{"id": "5513", "article": "Two new studies have investigated why fewer women , compared to men , study and work in the so - called STEM subjects in the United States : science , technology , engineering and mathematics . The American Association of University Women ( AAUW ) examined existing research . Its report \" Why So Few ? \" suggested ways to interest more girls and women in the STEM fields . The researchers found that cultural and environmental factors make a difference . Researcher Christianne Corbett says more boys than girls score very high on math tests in most countries , but Iceland and Thailand are exceptions . \" This is something that we point out in our report - - that cultural factors and societal factors can make a difference in who achieves at the very high levels and whether girls are achieving or not . \" Another study carried out by the Campos Company for the Bayer Corporation in the United States asked more than 1 , 000 women and minority members of the American Chemical Society about their experiences . 77 % said not enough women and minorities are working in STEM today , because they were not encouraged to study those subjects in school . The study , producing results similar to the AAUW research showed there ' s still a lot of work to be done . \" They say their interest in science begins before the age of eleven . So we need programs that get in front of kids while they ' re young in elementary school . \" Increasing diversity in professions leads to better products , better science . And developing this science and engineering workforce is important to the nation ' s economic development . \" No matter what career you go into , whether it ' s accounting , human resources or science career , it ' s important that you can think creatively , you can work in teams , you can adapt to change and that ' s important for everybody , \" says Rebecca Lucore .", "questions": "Which of the following is true about the situation in Iceland and Thailand ?", "options": {"model": ["less than half of the girls do n ' t work in the school .", "more girls score higher in math than boys ."], "human": ["Boys score higher in math tests than girls .", "More girls score higher in math than boys ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
