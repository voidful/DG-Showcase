{"id": "3156", "article": "Researchers in the US say they might have discovered how to fight against and even _ some processes of ageing , at least in mice . Injecting the blood of young mice into the older ones improved their brainpower , a study found . Scientists at Stanford University plan to carry out trials in people in the hope that new treatments for dementia can be developed . \" There are factors present in blood from young mice that can recharge an old mouse ' s brain so that it functions more like a younger one , \" says Dr . Tony from Stanford University School of medicine . In the study published in Nature Medicine , mice aged 18 months were given injections of the blood taken from mice aged 3 months . The injected mice performed better on memory tests than mice of the same age that had not been given the blood . Dr . Tony said it was not known whether the same was true of humans , but a trial was planned . A research center in UK said the treatment restored certain aspects of learning and memory in mice , but was of unknown importance to humans . The research , while very interesting , did not test the type of brain damage that was seen in dementia , which is not a necessary consequence of ageing . Meanwhile , two similar studies by a separate team have thrown more light on how young blood may benefit the old , in mice at least . A substance in the blood of mice previously shown to have an anti - ageing effect on heart muscle also improved brain cells , according to a Harvard team . The research , published in Science , found the blood factors encouraged the growth of brain cells in old mice , and restored their sense of smell . The same chemical also improved muscle power of aged mice , the researchers found .", "questions": "According to the studies , the blood from young mice benefits the old in certain ways except in", "options": {"model": ["mice ' s brain", "fur color"], "human": ["brain cells", "fur color"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
