{"id": "258", "article": "The last five pounds . The vanity pounds . The dream weight . The fantasy weight . The high school weight . Yes , many names are given to the weight - the five pounds - that seems just out of reach no matter how much we exercise and improve our eating habits . But why is it out of reach ? Is it all in our heads ? Or is it because the body has a set - point or ideal weight - a weight to which it does n ' t want to give in ? \" There is no such thing as ideal body weight , \" says James , author of \" Weight Loss That Lasts . \" \" But your body does resist you when you are trying to lose weight . It gets used to a certain weight over a long period of time and then will defend that weight . \" In other words , the body ' s \" set point \" can be lowered - or raised , he says , but it takes time to reset that new weight . That period of time is at least six months . \" I often ask patients , ' What is the lowest stable weight of your adult life ? ' to get an idea of what is realistic \" in terms of weight loss and maintenance , James says . He refers to the body ' s refusal to change , weight - wise , as an \" biological control system that prevents us from going hungry and dying - part of our primitive biology . \" Some people might get down to their dream weight for a short period but then ca n ' t keep it long because the calorie limits are too strict once the body starts defending itself against weight loss . \" That ' s why it ' s important to set realistic goals , \" he says . \" The idea of the ' ideal weight ' or ' dream weight ' is really just a useless exercise . \" But let ' s say your goal is realistic and has been set by a nutritionist or other weight - loss professionals and _ . What could be going on ? The reason is that you need fewer calories the less you weigh . So if you want to continue to drop weight , you have to drop calories and increase calorie - burn . James encourages people to tell the difference between weight loss goals for health reasons and those to do with vanity . \" They are different issues , \" James says . \" One is where important health benefits are seen and the other is about vanity - wanting to look good", "questions": "What does it mean by saying \" you are still plateauing \" ?", "options": {"model": ["your weight remains unchanged .", "your body weight will"], "human": ["Your weight keeps increasing .", "Your weight remains unchanged ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
