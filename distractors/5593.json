Research by scientists in Greece shows that living in the mountains is good for the heart and longevity . People living at higher altitude have lower possibility of dying from heart disease than those closer to sea level , even if they have factors that could increase their risk . \" Residence in mountainous areas seems to have a ' protective effect ' from heart disease , \" said Dr Nikos Baibas of the University of Athens . He and his colleagues suspect that the increased exercise from walking up mountainous area gives the heart a good workout and enables it to cope with lower levels of oxygen . Researchers studied the health records and death rates of 1 , 150 Greeks who lived in three villages near Athens over 15 years . One village was 1 , 000 meters above sea level and the other two were in low - lying areas . Although men and women living in the mountainous village had higher blood pressure rates and other risk factors than people in the other villages , they had a lower rate of death from heart disease and other causes after a fifteen year follow - up . \" The contrast was more evident among men than among women , \" Baibas added in a report in theJournal of Epidemiology and Community Health . Heart disease is one of the world ' s top killers . Smoking , high blood pressure , raised cholesterol levels , being overweight and a family history of the illness increase the possibility of developing the disease .", "questions": "The first sentence in the passage is used to", "options": {"model": ["tell readers what the passage focuses on", "tell readers the reasons for heart disease"], "human": ["warn people of the risk of heart disease", "tell readers what the passage focuses on"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
