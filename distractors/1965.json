{"id": "1965", "article": "The world is filled with smart , talented , educated and gifted people . We meet them every day . A few days ago , my car was not running well . I pulled it into a garage and the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes . He knew what was wrong by simply listening to the engine . I was amazed . The sad truth is , great talent is not enough . I am constantly shocked at how little talented people earn . I heard the other day that less than 5 percent of Americans earn more than $ 100 , 000 a year . A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling me how many doctors and dentists struggle financially . It was this business consultant who gave me the phrase , \" They are one skill away from great wealth . \" There is an old saying that goes , \" Job means ' just over broke ' \" . And unfortunately , I would say that the saying applies to millions of people . Because school does not think financial intelligence is intelligence , most workers \" _ \" . They work and they pay the bills . Instead I recommend to young people to seek work for what they will learn , more than what they will earn . When I ask the classes I teach , \" How many of you can cook a better hamburger than McDonald ' s ? \" almost all the students raise their hands . I then ask , \" So if most of you can cook a better hamburger , how come McDonald ' s makes more money than you ? \" The answer is obvious : McDonald ' s is excellent at business systems . The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on bui1ding a better hamburger and know little or nothing about business systems . The world is filled with talented poor people . They focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger .", "questions": "The main purpose of the author is to tell us", "options": {"model": ["why so many talented people are poor", "why there are so many successful people in america", "how to become a better hamburger"], "human": ["how young people can find a satisfactory job", "how McDonald ' s makes much money", "why so many talented people are poor"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
