{"id": "3910", "article": "( Reuters ) - - A group of Chinese scientists and explorers are looking for international help to organize a new search for the country ' s answer to Bigfoot , known locally as the \" Yeren \" , or \" wild man \" . Over the years , more than 400 people have said they saw the half - man , half - ape Yeren in a remote , mountainous area of the central province of Hubei , state news agency Xinhua said on Saturday . Expeditions in the 1970s and 1980s found hair , a footprint , and a sleeping nest suspected of belonging to the Yeren , but there has been no _ , the report added . Witnesses describe a creature that walks upright and is more than 2 meters tall with grey , red or black hair all over its body , Xinhua said . Now the Hubei Wild Man Research Association is looking for volunteers from around the world to join them on another expedition to look for the Yeren . \" We want the team members to be devoted , as there will be a lot of hard work in the process , \" Luo Baosheng , vice president of the group , told Xinhua .
