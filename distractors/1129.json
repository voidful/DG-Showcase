{"id": "1129", "article": "A child , who has once got interested in a tale , likes , as a rule , to have it retold in almost the same words , but this should not lead parents to treat printed fairy stories as formal texts . It is always much better to \" tell \" a story than just \" read \" it out of a book , and , if a parent can produce his own as an improvement on the printed text , according to his child ' s actual situation , so much the better . There is a charge made against some fairy tales , as they probably harm children by frightening them or leaving them sad feelings . To prove it , an experiment has been done to show that children who have heard terrible fairy stories often feel more uneasy than those who have not . As for fears , there are some cases where children get timid by some fairy story . Often , however , this arises from the child having heard the story once . Familiarity with the story by repetition may weaken the pain of fear . There are also people who object to fairy stories on the grounds that the stories are not objectively true , and that those giants , witches , two - headed dragons , magic carpets etc . do not really exist , so children should be taught to learn the reality by studying history , instead of being got fond of the strange side in fairy tales . Those , who prefer to create such stories , are so peculiar that it is hard to argue with them . If their creative exaggeration were _ , the world should be full of mad men attempting to fly from New York to Philadelphia on a stick or covering a telephone with kisses in the belief that it was their beloved girl - friend . Not once is a fairy story ever declared to be a description of the real world , but not every child is clever enough to be aware of it . Parents should choose their children ' s \" bed - time \" reading materials with much care . Only the fairy stories containing positive effect will make a clever and caring child with rich imagination .", "questions": "The author mentions \" sticks \" and \" telephones \" to prove that", "options": {"model": ["children should be taught to learn from the fairy stories", "fairy tales lead to misunderstanding", "fairy stories are too difficult for children", "fairy stories are too difficult to understand"], "human": ["fairy stories are all made up", "children are cheated by old stories", "there is more concern for children", "fairy tales lead to misunderstanding"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
