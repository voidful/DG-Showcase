{"id": "4985", "article": "My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening . The accommodation was n ' t wonderful , but we had everything we needed ( beds , blankets , food ) , and we were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air . On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group . Cameron had come along with two friends , Kevin and Simon , while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda . There were some other members I did n ' t know . We had come from different places and none of us knew the area . We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors , but none of us was sure exactly how . Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock - climbing and then we changed at lunchtime . Matt and I went to the caves first . Climbing out was harder than going in , but after a good deal of pushing , we were out at last . Though we were covered with mud , we were pleased and excited by what we ' d done . , .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["some of the group already knew each other", "the members of the group were from a different place"], "human": ["group all came from the same city", "some of the group already knew each other"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
