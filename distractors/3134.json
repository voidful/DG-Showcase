{"id": "3134", "article": "In a country that defines itself by ideals , not by shared blood , who should be allowed to come to work and live here ? In the wake of the Sept . 11 attacks these questions have never seemed more pressing . On Dec . 11 , 2001 , as part of the effort to increase homeland security , federal and local authorities in 14 states staged \" Operation Safe Travel \" - - - raids on airports to arrest employees with false identification . In Salt Lake City there were 69 arrests . But those captures were anything but terrorists , most of them illegal immigrants from Central or South America . Authorities said the undocumented workers ' illegal status made them open to blackmail by terrorists . Many immigrants in Salt Lake City were angered by the arrests and said they felt as if they were being treated like disposable goods . Mayor Anderson said those feelings were justified to a certain extent . \" We ' re saying we want you to work in these places , we ' re going to look the other way in terms of what our laws are , and then when it ' s convenient for us , or when we can try to make a point in terms of national security , especially after Sept . 11 , then you ' re disposable . They are whole families being uprooted for all of the wrong reasons , \" Anderson said . If Sept . 11 had never happened , the airport workers would not have been arrested and could have gone on quietly living in America , probably indefinitely . Ana Castro , a manager at a Ben & Jerry ' s ice cream shop at the airport had been working 10 years with the same false Social Security card when she was arrested in the December airport raid . Now she and her family are living under the threat of deportation . Castro ' s case is currently waiting to be settled . While she awaits the outcome , the government has granted her permission to work here and she has returned to her job at Ben & Jerry ' s .", "questions": "Undocumented workers became the target of \" Operation Safe Travel \" because", "options": {"model": ["the government encourages them to work in these places", "terrorists might take advantage of their illegal status", "the government encourages them to work there"], "human": ["most of them worked at airports under threat of terrorists", "they were reportedly helping hide terrorists around the airport", "terrorists might take advantage of their illegal status"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
