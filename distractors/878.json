{"id": "878", "article": "Dear Deidre , I am 17 . Further education is not for me . I want to be out seeing the world in the army . My mum and dad say they will cut me off and have nothing to do with me if I go into the military . They have other plans for me . My friends all laugh at me and say I wo n ' t ever get on . I know I am not the fittest guy in the world but I thought that would come with the training . I am now asking myself if I should just give up my lifelong ambitions and get the sort of job my parents approve of . I do n ' t want to look back with regrets but sometimes I think maybe they are right and know more than me . Samson Dear Samson , It ' s your life and your future . Your parents mean well , and may be fearful of what could happen to you if you are posted to a danger zone , but you must decide this by yourself . At least talk to an army recruitment office about what is involved and about how fit you need to be . Do your research . Find out everything you can about what choices you will have . Then go for it . Start a sensible eating and exercise plan right away . If you are motivated you can get reasonably fit in a few weeks . Tell your parents and friends you want to give it a try . If you still feel it ' s right for you , then apply . If it is n ' t for you , at least you wo n ' t regret for the rest of your life . Parents and friends may say , \" I told you so \" , but you will know that you ' ve followed your dream and made up your own mind about the sort of career for you . Talk to At East which is an independent and confidential organization providing advice and support for those who are in the military and those who would like to be . They can explain when you are allowed to leave and how much attention you have to give .
