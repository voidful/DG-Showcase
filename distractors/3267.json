{"id": "3267", "article": "Room doctors and medical groups around the world last weekend reacted with strong opposition to the news that an Italian specialist is _ cloning the first human baby . Dr . Severino Antinori , who is head of a hospital in Rome , has been referred to in an Arab newspaper claiming that one of his parents is eight weeks pregnant with a cloned baby . Antinori refused to comment on the reports , but in March 2001 he said he hoped to produce a cloned embryo for implantation with two years . So far seven different kinds of animals have already successfully been cloned , including sheep , cats and most recently rabbits . Doctors showed their doubt and were strongly opposed although they admitted that human cloning would finally come true unless there was a worldwide ban on the practice . Professor Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said , \" I find it astonishing that people do this where the result can be foretold that it will not be a normal baby . It is using humans as guinea pigs . It makes people feel sick . \" But Ronald Green , director of the Ethics Institute at Darmouth College in the USA , said it is unlikely that an eight - week - old pregnancy would lead to a birth . So far all cloned animals have suffered from some different serious disorders , many of them dying soon after their birth . Doctors are opposed to human cloning because they are worried about the welfare of the cloned child if there is one . \" There are no benefits of cloned human beings , just harm , \" said Dr . Michael Wilks of the U . K .", "questions": "What would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the first cloning humans", "the first cloned human", "a new cloning of humans", "the cloned humans"], "human": ["The Success of Cloning Humans", "The Anger at Cloning Humans", "Failure of Cloning Humans", "The first Cloned Human"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
