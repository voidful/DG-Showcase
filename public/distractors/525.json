{"id": "525", "article": "Green tea is believed to have originated in China thousands of years ago , where it was recognized for its health benefits . And scientists continue to probenew uses for it . Some studies suggest it can help protect against cancer . Thanks to the health food craze , green tea sales are currently rising sharply . The Tea Association of the USA reports that green tea sales jumped more than 60 percent in the last decade . And in Canada , government data shows that profits for green tea imports more than quadrupled . Nowadays , green tea seems to be everywhere . In shops , you can buy green tea leaves prepared in a number of ways : fried , powdered or steamed . Despite green tea ' s healthy reputation , the drink was once considered dangerous . Where did this silly opinion come from ? Blame the Victorians , of course , who lived in a period of English history in the 19th century . That ' s when some of the silliest theories about green tea arose . One 1882 book described strange experiments to show the harm of green tea . Apply some green tea below a frog ' s stomach , and you could cause paralysis in its legs , the book claimed . And injecting green tea into a dog would cause it to lose control of its legs and tail . The book went so far as to declare that green tea could kill someone . At that time , a green tea panic was sweeping England . Even Charlotte Bronte , a famous English writer , refused to touch the drink , fearing its terrible effects it would have on her nerves . Some of the fear was well reasonable , though . English consumers preferred brighter leaves , over dull olive - color1ed ones . As a result , tea sellers would dye their products , using anything including poisons like \" Prussian blue \" . Even today , mixing green tea with chemicals remains a problem . But those rare instances are n ' t stopping Westerners from raising their pinky fingers in salute to green tea and all its nutritional advantages .
