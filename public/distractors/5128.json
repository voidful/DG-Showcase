These were big bags , and they were filled with gas . Hydrogen is a useful gas for balloons . It is lighter than air . _ is also lighter than air , but it costs a lot of money . So balloons are usually filled with hydrogen . Balloons have to fly with the wind as they have no engines to drive them . Later , men made airships . They are balloons with engines . They are also filled with hydrogen . Aircrafts with wings now take people across the world . Powerful engines drive these machines across the sky . Some of the engines are like the engines of cars , but they are more powerful . There is another kind of engine , we call it the jet engine . An English engineer invented the jet engine . At the same time , Germans were also building a jet engine . In May 1941 , the English engineer ' s new engine was fixed in an aircraft , and the aircraft flew quite well . Jet engines are very powerful . Usually two to four are enough for an airplane , but some big aircraft need six . Anyone in a moving jet plane can feel the power of the engines . Jet planes can travel faster than sound . As a flying jet plane leaves its noise behind , we do not hear it until it has gone .", "questions": "According to the passage , men ca n ' t fly like birds because", "options": {"model": ["they have no engines to drive", "men do n ' t like birds", "men ' s bodies are too heavy", "they can fly"], "human": ["men do n ' t have aircraft", "men do n ' t like birds", "men ' s bodies are too light", "men ' s bodies are too heavy"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
