{"id": "1398", "article": "I think that the most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen . Just listen . Perhaps the most important thing we ever give each other is our attention and especially if its given from the heart . When people are talking , there ' s no need to do anything but receive them . Just take them in . Listen to what they ' re saying . Care about it . Most times caring about it is even more important than understanding it . When we interrupt what someone is saying to let them know that we understand , we move the focus of attention to ourselves . When we listen , they know we care . I have even learned to respond to someone crying by just listening . In the old days I used to reach for the tissues , until I realized that passing a person a tissue may be just another way to shut them down , to take them out of their experience of sadness and pain . Now I just listen . When they have cried all they need to cry , they find me there with them . This simple thing has not been that easy to learn . It certainly went against everything I had been taught since I was very young at school . I thought people listened only because they were too timid to speak or did not know the answer . A loving silence often has far more power to connect and to heal than the most well - intentioned words .", "questions": "What is probably the best title for this article ?", "options": {"model": ["do n ' t let others know you are talking", "listen , just listen"], "human": ["Listening and talking", "Listen , just listen"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
