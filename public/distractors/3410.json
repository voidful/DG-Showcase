{"id": "3410", "article": "First aid is emergency care for a victim of sudden illness or injury until more skillful medical treatment is available . It may save a life or improve certain vital signs including pulse , temperature , a clear airway , and breathing . In minor emergencies , first aid may prevent a victim ' s condition from turning worse and provide relief from pain . First aid must be done as quickly as possible . In the case of the seriously injured , a few minutes can make the difference between complete recovery and loss of life . First - aid measures depend upon a victim ' s needs and the provider ' s level of knowledge and skill . Knowing what not to do in an emergency is as important as knowing what to do . Improperly moving a person with a neck injury , for example , can lead to permanent spinal injury and paralysis . Despite the variety of injuries possible , several principles of first aid apply to all emergencies . The first step is to call for professional medical help . The victim , if conscious , should be reassured that medical aid has been requested , and asked for permission to provide any first aid . Next , assess the scene , asking other people or the injured person ' s family or friends about details of the injury or illness , any care that may have already been given , and pre - existing conditions such as diabetes or heart trouble . The victim should be checked for a medical card that describes special medical conditions . Unless the accident scene becomes unsafe or the victim may suffer further injury , do not move the victim . First aid requires rapid assessment of victims to determine whether life - threatening conditions exist . One method for evaluating a victim ' s condition is known by the acronym ABC , which stands for : A - - - Airway : is it open and clear ? B - - - Breathing : is the person breathing ? Look , listen , and feel for breathing . C - - - Circulation : is there a pulse ? Is the person bleeding extremely ? Check skin color and temperature for additional indications of circulation problems .", "questions": "First aid may bring about all the following results EXCEPT", "options": {"model": ["improving a victim ' s condition from being hurt", "asking a victim for help", "helping a person avoid sudden illness or injury", "helping a person recover"], "human": ["saving a victim ' s life", "preventing a victim ' s condition from getting worse .", "relieving a victim from pain", "helping a person avoid sudden illness or injury"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
