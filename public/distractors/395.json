{"id": "395", "article": "The health - care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships . One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or \" provider \" and purchaser or \" consumer \" in the typical doctor - patient relationship . In most sectors of the economy , it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price , quality , and use , and it is the buyer who makes the decision . Such condition , however , is not common in most of the health - care industry . In the health - care industry , the doctor - patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer . Once an individual has chosen to see a physician - - and even then there may be no real choice - - it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions : whether the patient should return \" next Wednesday \" , whether X - rays are needed , whether drugs should be prescribed , etc . It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price , especially when the disease is regarded as serious . This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care . The physician must certify the need for hospitalization , determine what procedures will be performed , and announce when the patient may be discharged . The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions , but in general it is the doctor ' s judgments that are final . Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real \" consumer \" . As a consequence , the medical staff represents the \" power center \" in hospital policy and decision - making , not the administration . Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants - - the physician , the hospital , the patient , and the payer ( generally an insurance carrier or government ) - - the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them . The hospital becomes an extension of the physician ; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the physician / hospital , and for the most part the patient plays a passive role . We estimate that about 75 - 80 percent of health - care choices are determined by physicians , not patients . For this reason , the economy directed at patients or the general is relatively ineffective .", "questions": "According to the author , when a doctor tells a patient to \" return next Wednesday \" , the doctor is in fact", "options": {"model": ["offering the patient more medical services", "receiving the patient ' s advice", "instructing the patient to buy more medical services"], "human": ["advising the patient to seek a second opinion", "warning the patient that a hospital stay might be necessary", "instructing the patient to buy more medical services"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
