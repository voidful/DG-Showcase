{"id": "2493", "article": "Take a book , leave a book . Public bookshelves are appearing across Germany on street corners , city squares and supermarkets . In these free - for - all libraries , people can take whatever they want to read , and leave behind anything they want for others . There is no need to register , no exact date to return books and you can take or give as many as you want . \" It is aimed at everyone who likes to read - - whatever age or education . It is open for everybody , \" said Michael Aubermann , a 44 - year - old who works in IT management . \" We put up our other outdoor shelves last year and it ' s been working really well , \" added Aubermann . The public book shelves , which are run with the money given by and cared for by local volunteer groups , have appeared independently of each other in many cities across Germany including Berlin , Hannover and Bonn , and also in suburbs and villages . Each shelf holds around 200 books and it takes about six weeks for a complete turnover , with new books taking the place of all the old ones , he said . While most of the shelves have so far been put up in rich neighborhoods , Aubermann and the 20 volunteers who help look after the project are planning to put up future shelves in poor neighborhoods , where people often do n ' t have such chances to read . So far , the Cologne book group has had few problems . For example , a used - book seller once emptied every copy on a shelf to sell at a market . Besides , book stores and online book sellers have their own ideas about free book exchanges .", "questions": "What ' s the text mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["germany is a country with a large number of books .", "germany is a country with a lot of public bookshelves .", "public bookshelves spread across germany ."], "human": ["Everyone has a chance to read in Germany .", "Germany is the first country to have public bookshelves .", "Public bookshelves spread across Germany ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
