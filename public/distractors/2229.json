{"id": "2229", "article": "Robinson Crusoe is a famous novel written by Daniel Defoe . The book tells the story of a man who is shipwrecked . He spends 28 years on an island near Venezuela . The book tells the story of everything that happens to Robinson Crusoe . He hopes someone will rescue him , but he has been there for so long on his own that he also begins to fear being rescued . Robinson Crusoe was published in 1719 . Most experts believe the story is based on the life of Alexander Selkirk , who was a Scottish sailor . On an expedition in 1704 , Selkirk had an argument with his ship ' s captain . Selkirk thought the ship was not safe and was about to fall apart . When the ship stopped at a remote island to get fresh water , Selkirk got off . He tried to get the other crew members to leave with him , but nobody would . The shop then sailed away without him . Selkirk spent four years and four months on his own on the island , known as Aguas Buenas . Selkirk was finally rescued by a ship that visited the island in 1709 . The ship ' s captain was grateful to Selkirk because he provided food for the crew when they arrived . Now archaeologists think they have found the remains of Selkirk ' s camp on Aguas Buenas . They found two deep holes that would have held wooden posts . The archaeologists say this is evidence that Selkirk built a shelter there . The post holes are near a fresh water stream . They are located quite high up , which would have meant that Selkirk was able to watch out for the ships coming close to the island . The most interesting evidence , the archaeologists say , is part of a piece of equipment used by sailors to navigate . Historians believe Selkirk was a navigator , so the instrument could have belonged to him . Robinson Crusoe was published ten years after Selkirk was rescued . Most experts think Daniel Defoe heard and read stories about Selkirk , which inspired him to write the book .", "questions": "The author wrote the text to", "options": {"model": ["tell a story about a crusoe", "explain the origin of robinson crusoe"], "human": ["promote sales to Robinson Crusoe", "explain the origin of Robinson Crusoe"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
