{"id": "3852", "article": "Let children learn to judge their own work . A child who learns to talk does not learn by being corrected all the time . If corrected too much . , he will stop talking . He notices a thousand times a day the differences between the language he uses and the language those around him . Little by little , he makes the necessary changes to make his language like other people ' s . In the same way , children learn to do all the other things without being taught - to walk , run , climb , whistle , ride a bicycle - compare their performances with those of more skilled people , and slowly make the needed changes . But in school we never give a child a chance to find out his mistakes and correct them himself . We do it all for his act as if we thought that he would never notice a mistake unless it was pointed out to him , or correct it unless he was made to . Let him work out , with the help of other children if he wants it , what this word says , what the answer is to that problem , whether this is a good way of saying or doing this or not . If it is a matter of right answers , as it may be in mathematics or science , give him the answer book . Let him correct his own papers . Why should we teachers waste time on such routine ( daily ) work ? Our job should be to help the children when they tell us that they ca n ' t find the way to get to measure their own understanding , how to know what they know or do not know .", "questions": "According to the writer , teachers in school should", "options": {"model": ["teach children how to do everything .", "encourage students to learn from the other language .", "encourage children to learn from each other .", "teach children to do everything without being taught ."], "human": ["point out children ' s mistakes whenever they are found .", "correct children ' s mistakes as much as possible .", "teach children more knowledge from book .", "encourage children to learn from each other ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
