{"id": "2233", "article": "Tulou , the special residential architecture of Fujian Province was included on the UNESCO ' s World Heritage List during the 32ndsession of the World Heritage Committee in Quebec , Canada . In the fourth century , Han Chinese living in the Central Plains area began to migrate south , gradually gathering in Fujian and forming the Hakka communities . As a defence against enemies , the Hakkas chose to live in compact communities , and the tulou was their preferred houses . Tens of thousands of such earthen structures were constructed in Fujian Province . Most tulous are to be found in the valleys , surrounded by high mountains , and some are in the depths of the great mountains . Most are three to four stories high , and look like circular blockhouses . Rooms on the first floor are used as kitchens , rooms on the second floor are used as barns , and rooms on the third and fourth floors are for bedrooms and living rooms . For defensive purposes , the rooms on the first floor have no windows . Raw materials for the tulou were obtained locally . Their main building material was a mixture of clay , sand , lime and water , and egg whites , brown sugar and rice water were added as adhesive agents . It was then mixed to form the walls . Once they dried , the walls were so hard that driving a nail into them would have been difficult . Fir branches , which are extremely strong and do not rot , were used to strengthen them , and many centuries later they have remained their original look . Tulous are located in a region where earthquakes happen frequently , and their circular construction helps them resist the regular shocks . The proven design even inspired one famous Peruvian architect , who paid several visits to Yongding , to build a tulou back home . Not long after , an earthquake struck only 10 kilometers away , and while all the houses around the earthen building fell down , his tulou remained .", "questions": "What would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the special earthen architecture of fujian", "the building of the hakkas in japan"], "human": ["One of UNESCO ' s World Heritage List", "The special Earthen Architecture of Fujian"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
