At lunch , I noticed that there were twin brothers who were talking to each other . I remembered my dad ' s advice , so I decided to try . I noticed that their lunchboxes were _ \" What ' s it like being a twin ? \" I asked . They looked surprised . Then one said , \" No one has ever asked us that ! \" \" Most of the time it ' s good , \" the other said . \" When you ' re a twin you always have someone to talk to and have lunch with . \" In no time we were laughing and talking . Then one of the brothers said , \" I ' m Nicholas , and this is my brother , Nathaniel . What ' s your name ? \" I took a deep breath and said , \" I ' m Chelsea Chowderhead . \" \" Chowder ?
