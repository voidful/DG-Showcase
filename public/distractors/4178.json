{"id": "4178", "article": "Smoking is harmful to our health , but many middle school students are smoking . Their teachers , parents or classmates ca n ' t stop them because they smoke anywhere they ca n ' t be seen - - on the way to school , in the dormitory , or even in the washroom . And most of the students think that smoking is very cool . But I want to tell you my story and then you will see that it ' s wrong to smoke when you are very young . When I was a middle school student , my friends at school smoked and they asked me to have a try . So I started smoking when I was fourteen . Soon I could n ' t wait to smoke as soon as I was free . After a month I could n ' t stop smoking . But two years later , I felt what smoking was doing to me . I could n ' t run far , I coughed every morning , and I got very weak . So I wanted to stop smoking . It was n ' t easy , but now I have stopped it , and I feel better . If you smoke , you will get ill more easily , and perhaps you ca n ' t grow taller , because there is something bad in cigarettes and also you may get some bad behaviors and habits such as stealing , _ and having a fight with others . So you can see smoking is a bad habit . If you smoke , try to stop . Though it is n ' t easy , you must do it as soon as possible .", "questions": "What ' s the main idea of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["students should n ' t stop smoking .", "middle school students should n ' t smoke .", "smoking is bad for middle school students .", "middle school students should stop smoking ."], "human": ["Middle school students are smoking .", "The writer stopped smoking .", "The reason why students smoke .", "Middle school students should stop smoking ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
