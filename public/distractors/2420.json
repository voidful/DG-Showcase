{"id": "2420", "article": "You ' ve see news reports about people who need help after a natural disaster or animals in need . Or perhaps you ' ve watched TV programs about how lonely older people can get . So what can you do about any of those things ? The answer : You can volunteer . Volunteering gives you an opportunity to change people ' s lives , including your own . Helping others in need is such an important part of the American way of life that many high schools require their students to spend a certain number of hours volunteering in order to graduate . Volunteering is n ' t like school : Instead of having the choices made for you about where to go and what subjects to learn , you can choose what really interests you and who ( or what ) is most deserving of your time . If you like animals , help out at a local animal shelter . Most shelters depend on volunteers to keep the cats and dogs happy and well exercised . If you have a friend or who has or had a medical problem ( like cancer , HIV , for example ) , you might be inspired to donate your time to help an organization that raises money for research , delivers meals , or offers other help to people with the illness . If you like children , there are lots of volunteering opportunities - - from being a Big Brother or Big Sister to helping out in an after - school sports program . You also can : serve food at a homeless shelter ; take part in a park cleanup day . And if you have more than one thing you love , you can combine the two . For example , if you love kids and are great at arts and crafts , visit your local children ' s hospital and offer to lead art activities for young patients .", "questions": "Which of the following is NOT a volunteer job ?", "options": {"model": ["helping sick people with cancer .", "doing some housework ."], "human": ["Helping homeless people .", "Doing some housework ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
