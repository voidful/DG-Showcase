{"id": "558", "article": "Preschool - aged children who can focus on a particular task for an extended period of time have a 50 percent greater chance of graduating from college , according to a new study from Oregon State University . Observing 430 preschoolers , researchers asked parents to rate their children based on social and behavioral skills , such as \" plays with a single toy for long periods of time \" or \" child gives up easily when difficulties are encountered . \" Additionally , in order to find out the changes happening on them , the children ' s reading and math skills were assessed at age 7 and again at age 21 . What researchers discovered was that the ability to pay attention and follow directions may be more critical than academic abilities to overall academic success . \" There is a big push now to teach children early academic skills at the preschool level , \" said Megan McClelland , an early child development researcher at Oregon State and lead author of the study , in a news release . \" Our study shows that the biggest predictor of college completion was n ' t math or reading skills , but whether or not they were able to pay attention and finish tasks at age 4 . \" Parents whose children rated higher on attention span and persistence at the age of 4 had a nearly 50 percent greater chance of completing their college degree by age 25 , according to the study . Fortunately , as McClelland noted in the news release , these social and behavioral skills can be taught , and the earlier adults step in to guide the student , the greater chances a child has to succeed academically . \" Academic ability carries you a long way , but these other skills are also important , \" McClelland said . \" Increasingly , we see that the ability to listen , pay attention , and complete important tasks is _ for success later in life . \"", "questions": "From the passage we know", "options": {"model": ["preschool children ' s academic ability can be improved .", "preschool children ' s performance can reflect their future ."], "human": ["preschool children can focus on things for a long time .", "preschool children ' s performance can reflect their future ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
