{"id": "5264", "article": "Scientists are developing a new kind of machine to take the place of humans . These machines can do jobs in places that are too dangerous for humans . For example , they are being developed to work in nuclear power center , deep under the oceans and in outer space . John Marrit , a psychologist in Williamsburg Massachusetts , helped develop the new machine . This is how they work . A machine is placed in an area far away from the person who operates it . The person wears special hard hat with television screens and sound equipment . The screens and sound equipment let the person see and hear exactly what the machine is seeing and hearing . Mr . Marrit says this gives the person the feeling of being in the same place as the machine . The idea , he says , is being there without going there . The person uses an electronic control to make the machine move . The machine copies the person ' s movements exactly . If the person raises his right arm , the machine raises the right arm , too . This means an expert can do a dangerous job while staying in the safe place . For example , a person can direct the machine to destroy a bomb without going near the bomb himself .", "questions": "The machine", "options": {"model": ["does n ' t work without the person ' s help", "does n ' t work without the person", "does exactly what the person does"], "human": ["follows the person ' s order", "is controlled by a television on the person ' s head", "does exactly what the person does"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
