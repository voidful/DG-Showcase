{"id": "3775", "article": "During a career planning class , Brenda Fabian asked how many students use Facebook , a popular online networking community for college students . Almost everyone in the room raised a hand . \" Then I asked how many knew that employers are reviewing Facebook for hiring purposes , \" says Fabian , director for Center for Career Services at Susquehanna University . \" No hands were raised , and their faces revealed the students ' surprise . \" Although some parents do keep track of their teen ' s online activities , most teenagers do n ' t realize that websites may be monitored by schools , prospective employers or anyone else who might be interested in the teenager ' s lifestyle not just today but anytime in the future . Most of us do n ' t realize that the information that gets posted on the Internet may be deleted , but it does n ' t disappear permanently . \" The stuff is there forever , \" says Jamie Riehle , director of Web Publishing at Lycos . \" It is backed up on servers and does n ' t go away . \" As company recruiters , college admission officers , law enforcement personnel and parents become more Web savvy , it becomes even more vital for teenagers to be cautious when posting any information on their websites . Even though sites that are private can be seen only by a preselected list of friends , there are companies that , for a fee , can dig deeper into cyberspace and find anything . Even government officials who thought that deleting email would exonerate ( . . . . . . ) them from wrongdoing are discovering that , on the Web , there is no such thing as private or gone forever . Steven Rothenberg , president and founder of College - Recruiter . com , suggests that teenagers think of their Web posts as tattoos . \" Inherently , there is nothing wrong with them if they are private , \" he says . \" But if they are visible or offensive , it can affect the way others see you . \"", "questions": "Steven Rothenberg believes that", "options": {"model": ["it is right to post information on the internet", "it ' s acceptable to post information online", "teenagers should be cautious about their posts online", "it is right to post information online"], "human": ["teenagers should not be allowed to post anything online", "teenagers should keep their information private online", "teenagers should be monitored online", "teenagers should be cautious about their posts online"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
