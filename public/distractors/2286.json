{"id": "2286", "article": "Many schools have established successful home visit programs . Home visits by teachers let parents and children know how much teachers care . Also , it is a way for teachers to learn more about their students , get the parents to pay more attention to their children ' s education and bridge cultural gaps that might exist between students and teachers . Most teachers report that their home visits have a lasting effect on the child , the parents and on parent - - teacher communication . The Head Start program has used home visits for many years . Head Start teachers are required to make at least two home visits for each student , regardless of their ability , during each school year in addition to regular parent - teacher conferences at school . Many U . S . kindergartens also require home visits by teachers before school starts . The visit approach varies from school to school and usually depends on the funding the source . In some schools , teachers prefer to visit in pairs . They feel more comfortable that way and sometimes need a translator in order to communicate with a child ' s parents . Other teachers visit one - on - one with parents . Some interact with both the child and the parent . Many teachers may bring along learning activities for the child that also involve the parents participation . Normally , visits can last from 30 to 90 minutes , depending on the teacher and the activities . When teachers get to know their students and their students ' families , the parents become more active in their children ' s education . Home visits , not unnecessary as some people think , can give teachers the ideas they need to help all students succeed .", "questions": "The effect of home visits is that", "options": {"model": ["teachers can improve their children ' s knowledge .", "teachers can learn more about how to help students .", "parents and teachers can help the students .", "students are more active in their parents ' studies ."], "human": ["parents have more opportunities to play with children .", "students can succeed more easily through their own efforts .", "parents play a decisive role in children ' s education .", "teachers can learn more about how to help students ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
