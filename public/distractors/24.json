{"id": "24", "article": "George Gershwin , born in 1998 , was one of America ' s greatest composers . He published his first song when he was eighteen years old . During the next twenty years he wrote more than five hundred songs . Many of Gershwin ' s songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City . These plays were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s . Many of his songs have remained popular as ever . Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way - - from jazz to country . In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music . Could jazz , some people asked , be considered serious music ? In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music . Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized he had just a few weeks to do it . And in that short time , he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called Rhapsody in Blue . Gershwin himself played the piano at the concert . The audience were thrilled when they heard his music . It made him world - famous and showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular . In 1928 , Gershwin went to Paris . He applied to study composition with the well - known musician Nadia Boulanger , but she rejected him . She was afraid that classical study would ruin his jazz - influenced style . While there , Gershwin wrote An American in Paris . When it was first performed , critics were divided over the music . Some called it happy and full of life , to others it was silly and boring . But it quickly became popular in Europe and the United States . It still remains one of his most famous works . George Gershwin died in 1937 , just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer . He was only thirty - nine years old . Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages . People mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have still written .", "questions": "What do we know about the concert organized by Whiteman ?", "options": {"model": ["it was first performed by george gershwin", "it proved jazz could be serious music", "it was performed by gershwin"], "human": ["It made Gershwin leader of the orchestra", "It caused a debate among jazz musicians", "It proved jazz could be serious music"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
