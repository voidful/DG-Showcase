{"id": "1990", "article": "The forest in Senegal , a country in western Africa , is full of the chimps ' usual noises . Suddenly dogs bark . Larger male chimps drop from the trees to face the threat while the others climb to safety . Then the dogs ' young human masters appear . One mother chimp with a tiny baby tries to run . The dogs attack and separate them . The two teenage boys quickly catch the baby chimp . But they do n ' t act out of sympathy - - - they save the baby so they can sell it . After the teenagers return to their hometown , they visit a man who is said to be very interested in chimps . When they ask the man , Johnny Kante , if he wants to buy the baby , he replies , \" That ' s not what we do . \" Kante is a member of a scientific team . Although Kante is angry with the teens for capturing the chimp , he hides his anger and persuades them to take him to the baby chimp . Unsure of what to do next upon seeing the chimp , Kante calls Jill Pruetz , the head of the chimp research team . \" I ' m really worried , \" says Pruetz , doubtful that the mother is still alive . But knowing that wild chimps sometimes adopt orphans , Kante and pruetz decide they must try to return the baby chimp to its wild community . Kante pays another visit to the teenagers . After he explains how much trouble they are in , because chimps are an endangered species , he requests they should give him the frightened baby without payment . They agree . Kante takes the baby chimp to his home and feeds her milk from a bottle whenever she cries . The next morning , Pruetz and Kante leave the baby with another team member and begin their search for the wild chimps . Pruetz quickly finds the group in the woods . She recognizes the female that is without her child . Pruetz is so excited that she runs the entire mile back to bring the baby chimp to the tree where the chimps are hanging out . The researchers place the baby on the ground near the tree", "questions": "What is the main idea of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["why the chimp is endangered in the wild .", "how caring people reunite a baby chimp with her mother .", "why the chimp is endangered .", "how the chimp is brought up by the researchers ."], "human": ["How precious chimps are .", "An adult chimp ' s deep love for her baby .", "The dangers the wild chimps are facing .", "How caring people reunite a baby chimp with her mother ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
