{"id": "1162", "article": "There are many theories about how drama came into being in ancient Greece . The one most widely accepted today is based on the assumption that drama developed gradually from ceremonies . The argument for this view goes as follows . In the beginning , human beings viewed the natural forces of the world as unpredictable , and they sought through various means to control these unknown powers . Those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then kept and repeated until they hardened into fixed ceremonies . Eventually stories arose which explained the mysteries of the ceremonies . As time passed , some of them were abandoned , but the stories , later called myths , provided materials for art and drama Those who believe that drama came out of ceremonies also argue that those ceremonies contained the seed of theater because music , dance , and masks were almost always used . In addition , there were performers , and , since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in the rules of ceremonies , religious leaders usually assumed that task . Wearing masks , they often impersonated other people , animals , or supernatural beings , and performed the desired effect by gestures - - success in hunt or battle , the coming rain , the revival of the Sun - - as an actor might . Eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities . Another theory finds out the theater came from the human Interest in storytelling . According to this view , tales ( about the hunt , war , or other events ) are gradually formed , at first through the use of impersonation , action , and dialogue by a speaker and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person A closely related theory about drama _ those dances that are primarily rhythmical and gymnastic or that are imitations of animal movements and sounds .", "questions": "The best title for the text would be", "options": {"model": ["the history of drama", "the development of drama", "the influence of dramas", "the origin of drama"], "human": ["The Development of Drama", "The History of Drama", "The Popularity of Drama", "The Origin of Drama"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
