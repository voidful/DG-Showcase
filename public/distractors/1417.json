To one ' s surprise , he managed to reach his friend , raised him onto his shoulder , and brought him back to their company ' s trench . As the two of them fell in together to the bottom of the trench , the officer checked the wounded soldier , and then looked kindly at his friend . \" I told you it would n ' t be worth it , \" he said . \" Your friend is dead , and your wound is deadly . \" \" It was worth it , though , sir . \" the soldier said . \" How do you mean ' worth it ' ? \" responded the commander . \" Your friend is dead ! \" \" Yes sir . \" the soldier answered . \" But it was worth it because when I got to him , he was still alive , and I had the satisfaction of hearing him say , ' Jim , I knew you ' d come .
