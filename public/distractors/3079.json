{"id": "3079", "article": "Kalle Lasn was in a supermarket parking lot one afternoon when he had an experience that changed his life . In order to shop at the store , he needed to put money into the shopping cart to use it . Annoyed that he had to \" pay to shop , \" Lasn jammed the coin into the cart so that it would n ' t work . It was an act of _ - - the first of many - - for Lasn . Born in Estonia , Kalle Lasn moved to Australia as a young man and then later to Japan , where he founded a marketing research firm in Tokyo . Eventually , Lasn moved to Canada and for several years produced documentaries for public television . In the late 1980s , Lasn made an advertisement that spoke out against the logging industry and the deforestation going on in the Pacific Northwest . When he tried to show his ad on TV , though , no station in this area would give him airtime . In response , Lasn and a colleague founded Adbusters Media Foundation , a company for the \" Human right to communicate . Adbusters produces magazine , newspaper , and TV ads with a social message . Many use humor and irony to make their points : In one , for example , a man chain smokes a brand of cigarettes called \" Hope \" . In another , a child is dressed in an outfit used in fast - food ads . Next to the child is a note from its mother telling the restaurant to leave her child alone . Adbusters also has a magazine and a web site , the Culture Jammers Network , whose members include students , artists , and activists as well as educators and businesspeople interested in social change . Many of these \" culture jammers \" are working to raise awareness about different social issues by hosting events like \" Buy Nothing Day \" , \" No Car Day \" and \" TV Turnoff Week \" . Lasn and his partners hope these events will encourage people to think about questions such as ; * What kinds of things are we being encouraged to buy by the media ? * Should cars be our primary means of transportation ? * How are television and radio being used now ? How could we be using them ? Some culture jammers are using other methods to challenge how people think . Some pretend to be shoppers . They move items in stores from one shelf to another making it difficult for people to find things", "questions": "Some culture jammers break into websites in order to", "options": {"model": ["ask people to be thoughtful consumers .", "make people think about their social problems .", "encourage people to think about problems"], "human": ["encourage people to think less and buy less", "challenge how people react to sudden changes", "ask people to be thoughtful consumers ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
