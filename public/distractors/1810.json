{"id": "1810", "article": "The Venice Carnival is the largest and the most important Venetian festival . It is a festival that celebrates the passage from winter to spring , a time when seemingly anything is possible , including the illusion that the people at the bottom become the most powerful by wearing masks on their faces . The Venice Carnival could date back to 1296 . It was confirmed on the day before Lent , a public holiday , but it had no direct religious connection at that time . However , the participants were not allowed to wear masks around the city at night ; men could not enter convents if they pretended to be women , and celebrations within the convents were strictly forbidden . People who broke the rules could be put into prison . The laws were not relaxed until the late 17thcentury , when the carnival - goers were allowed to wear masks throughout the carnival . Participants would wear a white mask in old days , while costumes have become even wilder today . St . Mark ' s Square is the center for the carnival , while Campo San Polo and Sestiere are two other popular places where events take place . Most of the events are free , along with several unusual masked balls for which visitors will have to buy tickets in advance . The 2012 Venetian Carnival was celebrated from February 11 to 21 . There were the liveliest celebrations of parties , performances , show , music , dances , dinner sets along streets , and hotels . It attracted a great number of visitors around the world . Many travelers booked Venice hotels and prepared costumes and masks well ahead of time so that they could n ' t be made fun of by local people .", "questions": "In the Venice Carnival people wearing masks", "options": {"model": ["can wear a white mask in old days", "can imagine they have great power"], "human": ["frighten those without masks", "can imagine they have great power"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
