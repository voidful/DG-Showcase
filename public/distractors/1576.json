Music even has the power to move us to tears when it stirs an emotional reaction . How then , does music play a role in special education ? If music has the ability to touch those hidden places we all carry inside , it proves an important tool for the special education teacher . For students with emotional problems , music can help soothe sadness . Consider the child that arrives in class depressed and upset . If music can indeed relax and calm him , he is more likely to focus and participate in class . Dr . R . Joseph , author of Behavioral Neurology , writes , \" It is well recorded that patients with left hemisphere damage , who may be unable to speak or recognize words , can sing a melody . \" For this reason , some special education teachers have found it helpful to set their lessons to music . When students can not understand or remember certain things , singing them helps make it easier . Nature magazine reported \" Music training helps underachievers . In Rhode Island , researchers studied eight public school first grade classes . Half of the classes became ' text - arts ' groups , receiving ongoing music training . After seven months , the students were given a test . The tested group had caught up with their fellow students in reading and surpassed their classmates in math by 22 percent . In the second year of the project , the tested students widened this even further . Students were also tested on attitude and behavior . Classroom teachers also noted improvement in these areas . \" It seems music does , indeed , play an important role in education . For the special education teacher , this is especially encouraging .", "questions": "According to Dr . R .
