{"id": "1304", "article": "On behalf of the Obama family , I want to wish you a very happy Thanksgiving . Like many of you . we ' ll spend the day with family and friends , catching up , eating some good food and watching a little football . Before we lift a fork , we lend a hand by going out in the community to serve some of our neighbors in need . And we give thanks for each other , and for all of God ' s blessings . We all share this day , united by the gratitude for the bounty of this nation . And we welcome the contributions of all people - no matter their origin or color or beliefs - who call America home , and who enrich the life of our nation . It is a belief as old as our founding : \" Epluribus unum \" - - _ . We are reminded that this creed , and America itself was never an inevitability , but the result of ordinary people in every generation doing their part to uphold our founding ideals - by taking the blessings of freedom , and multiplying them for those who would follow . As President Kennedy once wrote , even as we give thanks for all that we ' ve inherited from those who came before us - \" the decency ( , ) of purpose , steadfastness of resolve and strength of will , for the courage and the humility , which they possessed . \" we must also remember that \" the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them . \" Today , we are grateful to all Americans who do their part to live by those ideals , including our brave men and women in uniform overseas and their families , who sacrifice so much to keep America safe . We are grateful to the countless Americans who serve their communities in soup kitchens and shelters , looking out for those who are less fortunate , and lifting up those who have fallen on hard times . This generosity , this compassion , this belief that we are each other ' s keepers , is essential to who we are , not just on this day , but every day . It ' s easy to focus on what separates us . But as we gather with loved ones on this Thanksgiving , let ' s remember and be grateful for what ties us together . Our love of country .
