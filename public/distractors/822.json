{"id": "822", "article": "People who have a fear of ugly insects will want to stay far away from Lake Tawakoni State Park in north Texas , US . A giant spider web was recently found there . The thick web is swarming with millions of little spiders . Stretching across several acres it blankets a number of trees , bushes and even the ground . While the web may make some people nervous , it has become a big attraction for others - especially for unlucky insects . \" At first , it was so white that it looked like fairyland , \" said Donna Garde , the park ' s manager . \" Now it ' s filled with so many mosquitoes that it ' s turned a little brown . \" Most spiders work alone , which is why the discovery of the huge web has caused such a stir . Scientists across the country have been debating its origin . Some spider experts ' say the monstrous web may have been weaved by social spiders . Social spiders work together to build larger webs to catch small insects . However , those webs take years to build . Park officials say this web was formed in just a few months . Others say it could be the work of millions of tiny ballooning spiders . These types of spiders ' fly ' by throwing out thin threads of silk , which they use to ride air currents . In 2002 , a similar giant web made by ballooning spiders was discovered in a field in Canada . Texas entomologist Herbert Pase says the giant web is very unusual . \" From what I ' m hearing , it could be a once - in - a - life - time event , \" he said . But John Jackman , an entomologist and professor at Texas A & M University , disagrees . Jackman says he hears reports of similar webs , like the one in Canada , every few years . \" There are a lot of folks that do n ' t realize spiders do that , \" he said . \" Until we get some samples sent to us , we wo n ' t know what species of spider we ' re talking about . \" Park officials expect the web to last until fall when the weather gets cooler .
