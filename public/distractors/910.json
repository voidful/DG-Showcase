{"id": "910", "article": "Dear College Dean It is my understanding that this college has received a large donation to be used to enhance ( improve ) the quality of life for students : expand the bookstore or add computers to the computer lab . It is the tradition of this school to promote education and to be at the vanguard of new technology . That is why I strongly argue in favor of the addition of more computers to the computer lab . Although expanding the campus bookstore to include CDs , gifts , and a snack bar will give a nicer look to the college , we have to think about a greater goal and a more practical way to enhance the quality of life for students . What do we want for our students and our college ? Do we want our college to be known as a place with a great bookstore where you can find CDs and gifts , or as a place where the students can explore and research in their field using the best tools provided by technology ? In addition , there are already several snack bars on campus , and there are music stores nearby , so students do not depend on the college bookstore for these things . We live in a highly technological world and computers play an increasingly important role in how we live . As a learning institution , this college has the responsibility to offer its students the best technology to help them prepare for their future . Many students will be expected to be familiar with the latest software and other tools when they go on to work or to graduate school . While they are in college , students find they are expected to use computers . Many professors expect students to use computers to do homework or to complete projects . Students are asked to create PowerPoint presentations and use spreadsheets and database programs , as well as to research many topics on the Internet . Since students are competing for good grades , those who have limited access to computers are at a great disadvantage . Furthermore , being able to do projects using the computer enhances the process of learning , giving students the opportunity to find information that without a computer would be much more difficult to find . If there are more computers , students will also be able to complete their work more efficiently . No more will they have to wait in line , paper and disk in hand , while scanning the room for an empty chair and computer . No longer will they have to sit and wait while an out", "questions": "The purpose of the author in writing the passage is", "options": {"model": ["to show the importance of computers to college students", "to persuade the dean to purchase more advanced computers", "to persuade the writer to buy more computers", "to encourage students to use computers"], "human": ["to describe the problems caused by lack of computers", "to explain why students are in great need of computers", "to tell us what benefits students can gain from computers", "to persuade the Dean to purchase more advanced computers"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
