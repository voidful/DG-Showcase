{"id": "5308", "article": "Books are a high cost of higher education . But the Global Text Project hopes to create a free library of one thousand electronic textbooks for students in developing countries . The aim is to offer subjects that students may take in their first few years at university . The books could be printed or read on a computer or copied onto a CD or DVD . Richard Watson is the acting head of the department of management information systems at the University of Georgia , who says the idea goes back several years . He was teaching a computer programming class but did not have a good textbook . So he asked his students each to write part of the book that he would organize and edit . By the end of the term , Professor Watson had a finished product . Since then he has used it for other classes . Now , Professor Watson is seeking volunteers to supervise the creation of books for the library . He is looking for professors or other professionals . The Global Text Project is similar in technology to Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia ( a reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects ) that anyone can edit on the Internet . But only one or two people will be able to make the final edits in texts . The project includes a committee of scholars , mostly from developing countries , to advise on required textbooks and their contents . The group ' s first book on information systems is being tested in Ethiopia and Indonesia . The plan is to offer about ten free books within the next year , including an English grammar text . Project organizers also want to offer textbooks in Arabic , Chinese and Spanish . They are working with a translation company and students could also get involved . For example , a student learning English in an Arab country could translate part of a book into Arabic . Then another student and the class professor could check the translation .", "questions": "The main subject discussed in the passage is", "options": {"model": ["e - books for colleges in developing nations", "e - books for free", "e - books for college students", "e - books for foreign countries"], "human": ["how to create a free library", "how to edit textbooks on the Internet", "volunteers in the Global Text Project", "E - books for colleges in developing nations"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
