You could see many concerned people with masks trying their best to stop the swine flu . And the masks are n ' t only being used in Mexico . A friend of mine traveling from New York City to Florida was given a mask and a pair of gloves just after he reached the airport . And another friend went to get a haircut only to be faced with a hairdresser wearing a mask ! But do the masks really work ? Is covering your nose and mouth the key to stopping the swine flu ? To find out the truth , ABC ' s reporter Sharyn Alfonsi talked with germ expert Dr . Elaine Larsen . It turns out that when you sneeze the air coming out of your mouth at a speed of one hundred miles per hour carries germs which can travel anywhere around you and make people around you infected . However , whether you become infected actually depends on the weather . As Sharyn reported , when you sneeze , the germs leave your body in small drops of water coming out of your mouth . If the weather is wet , the wet air will make the small drops bigger and heavier and they drop down towards our feet . If this happens , we wo n ' t become infected . But if the air is dry , those small drops can float higher up , making it possible for them to touch someone else ' s nose , mouth or their mask . Larsen says the masks can stop the germs well but after a few hours , they start to get wet , holding a lot of germs they come across and causing you to breathe them in . The masks do work , but the key to stopping the germs is changing your masks often .", "questions": "What should we pay attention to when wearing masks ?", "options": {"model": ["changing the clothes of the germs .", "using them to stop the germs .", "using the masks .", "changing the masks often ."], "human": ["Keeping the masks dry .", "Choosing very thick masks .", "Wearing big masks .", "Changing the masks often ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
