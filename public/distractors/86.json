{"id": "86", "article": "Now , there is a growing movement to pay the students in American schools - - - in some cases , even just for coming to class . Students at one school in New Mexico can earn up to three hundred dollars a year for good attendance . In Baltimore , Maryland , high scores in state graduation tests can be worth more than one hundred dollars . And a New Jersey school system plans to pay students fifty dollars a week to attend after - - - school tutoring programs . Schools that pay students can be found in more than one - - - fourth of the fifty states . Other schools pay students with food or other rewards . Robert Schaefer is a public education director . He says paying students may improve performance in the short term , but students develop false expectations for the future . He sees a lack of long term planning in these programs because of the pressure on schools to raise test scores . Public schools need to show improvement under the education reform law . Low - - - performing schools may lose their federal money ; teachers and administrators may lose their jobs . Often these schools are in poor neighborhoods where getting students to go to school can be a continual problem . Critics say paying students sends a message that money is the only valuable reward . But some students say it makes school more exciting . And some teachers have reported getting more requests for extra help . In two thousand four , the city schools in Coshocton , Ohio , launched a program . They wanted to see if paying elementary school students as much as one hundred dollars would help in passing the state exams . Now , Eric Bettinger of Case Western Reserve University ( EUCWRU ) has reported mixed results . Math scores increased , but only white students were able to get paid . And there was no evidence of higher scores in reading , social studies and science . Official will decide later this year whether to continue the program .", "questions": "According to the text , Robert Schaefer", "options": {"model": ["thinks people should make a careful plan for the paying program", "thinks it ' s necessary to pay the students in the government", "thinks it ' s necessary to pay the program"], "human": ["thinks highly of paying students", "thinks students will show improvement in study in the future", "thinks people should make a careful plan for the paying program"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
