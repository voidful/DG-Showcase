{"id": "4139", "article": "Is there intelligent life on other planets ? For years , scientists said \" no \" or \" We do n ' t know . \" But today this is changing . Seth Shostak and Alexandra Barnett are astronomers . They believe intelligent life exists somewhere in the universe . They also think we will soon contact these beings . Why do Shostak and Barnett think intelligent life exists on other planets ? The first reason is time . Scientists believe the universe is about 12 billion years old . \" This is long enough for other planets to have intelligent life , \" say Shostak and Barnet . The second reason is size - - the universe is huge . \" Tools like the Hubble telescope have shown that there are at least 100 billion galaxies , \" says Shostak . \" And our galaxy , the Milk Way , has at least 100 billion stars . Some planets going around these stars might be similar to Earth . \" In the past , it was hard to look for signs of intelligent life in the universe . But now , powerful telescopes allow scientists to discover smaller planets - - the size of Mars or Earth in other solar systems . These planets might have intelligent life . Have beings from space already visited Earth ? \" Probably not , \" says Shostak . \" It ' s a long way away . However , intelligent beings may contact us in other way , such as radio signs . In fact , they may be trying to communicate with us now , but we do n ' t have the right tools to receive their messages . However , this is changing . By 2025 , we could make contact with other life forms in our universe and we might help each other . \"", "questions": "Why have n ' t beings from space visited us yet according to Shostak ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s a long way away .", "they do n ' t have the right tools to receive their messages ."], "human": ["They do n ' t know how to use radio signs .", "It ' s a long way away ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
