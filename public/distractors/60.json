{"id": "60", "article": "Dear Alcohol , You ' ve been around forever . I can remember all the pain you ' ve caused for me . Do you remember the night you almost took my father ' s life ? I do . He loves you . Sometimes I think he loves you more than he loves me . He ' s addicted to you , to the way you promise to rid him of his problems only to cause more of them . You just sat back and laughed as his car went spinning through the street , crashing into two other cars . He was n ' t the only one hurt by you that night . Do you remember the night of my first high school party ? You were there . My friends _ you . They treated you as if they were never going to see you again , drinking all of you that they could . I spent two hours that night helping my friends who had fallen completely . \" I ' m so embarrassed , \" they said as I held their hair back so that they could vomit . \" I ' m sorry , \" they said when I called taxies for them , walking them out and paying the driver in advance . \" This wo n ' t happen again , \" they said as they were sent to the hospital to have their stomachs pumped . Two 15 - year - old girls slept in hospital beds that night thanks to you . Do you remember the night when you took advantage of my 17 - year - old neighbor who had to drive to pick up his sister from her dance lessons ? Do you know how we all felt when he hit another car and killed the two people in the other car ? He died the next morning too . His sister walked home from her dance lesson , and passed police cars and a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk just two blocks away from the dance studio . She did n ' t realize her brother was in the midst of it all . She never saw him again . And it ' s all your fault . I wish you ' d walk out of my life forever . I do n ' t want anything to do with you . Look at all the pain you ' ve caused . Sure , you ' ve made people happy too from time to time . But the damage you ' ve caused in the lives of millions is inexcusable .
