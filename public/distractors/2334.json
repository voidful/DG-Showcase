{"id": "2334", "article": "I try not to be biased but I had my doubts about hiring Stevie . His social worker assured me that he would be a good , reliable busboy . But I had never had a mentally handicapped employee . He was short , a little fat , with the smooth facial features and thick - togued speech of Down ' s Syndrome . I thought most of my customers would be uncomfortable around Stevie , so I closely watched him for the first few weeks . I should n ' t have worried . After the first week , Stevie had my staff wrapped around his stubby little finger , and within a month my regular trucker customers had adopted him as their official truck stop mascot . After that , I really did n ' t care what the rest of the customers thought of him . He was like a 21 - year - old in blue jeans and Nikes , eager to laugh and eager to please , but fierce in his attention to his duties . Every salt and pepper shaker was exactly in its place , not a bread crumb or coffee spill was visible when Stevie got done with the table . Our only problem was persuading him to wait to clean a table until after the customers were finished . Over time , we learned that he lived with his mother , a widow who was disabled . Money was tight , and _ . That ' s why the restaurant was a gloomy place that morning last August , the first morning in three years that Stevie missed work . He was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester getting a heart surgery . His social worker said that people with Downs Syndrome often had heart problems at an early age and there was a good chance he would come through the surgery in good shape and be back at work in a few months . A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when word came that he was out of surgery , in recovery , and doing fine . Frannie , my head waitress , did a little dance when she heard the good news . Belle Ringer , one of our regular trucker customers , stared at her and asked , \" Okay , Frannie , what was that all about ? \" \" We just got word that Stevie is out of surgery", "questions": "Why did the author ask Stevie to clean up the mess on the table ?", "options": {"model": ["the customers did n ' t care what the rest of the customers did .", "the customers did n ' t care what the rest of his customers thought of him .", "stevie could pick up the money that was given to him .", "many customers did n ' t care about his son ' s being a worker ."], "human": ["The table was so dirty that it needed cleaning .", "It was Stevie ' s duty to clean the table .", "She wanted to congratulate Stevie on his coming back .", "Stevie could pick up the money that was given to him ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
