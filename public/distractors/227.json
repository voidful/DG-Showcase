{"id": "227", "article": "When I was eight years old , I had a big accident . I get scared even now when I think about that time . There were many people skating near my house , and seeing them skate so wonderfully , I could n ' t wait to have a try , just a piece of cake , I thought . I went with a friend who was very skillful . He spent a long time teaching me how to skate , but I still did n ' t learn much , which made him very angry . Finally , he left me and skated all around . I skated alone and soon got bored because I kept falling down so I took off my skates and just walked around on the ice in my shoes . It was cold and my feet were frozen . Suddenly , I stepped on something that was not hard . What was it ? It was a weak place in the ice . When I stepped there , I sank under the ice . I thought that I was going to die , but I did my best to grab something to get out from under the ice . I would have climbed out myself by grabbing the edge of the ice , but at that time I was only a child of eight . I cried out . Fortunately , someone helped me . He grabbed my arms and pulled me up . Those several minutes seemed a year to me . I thanked him . At that time , my friend came back . I was annoyed at him because he was supposed to take care of me , but he did n ' t . He was embarrassed . When I took a taxi home , the taxi driver was surprised and asked what had happened . I did n ' t want to say anything because I was tired and scared . Since then , I have never touched skating .", "questions": "Why did the writer ' s friend leave and skate alone ?", "options": {"model": ["he did n ' t know the writer ' s performance .", "he was disappointed at the writer ' s performance ."], "human": ["He found he had no gift for teaching others to skate .", "He was disappointed at the writer ' s performance ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
