Thanksgiving Day is really a harvest festival . This is why it is celebrated in late fall , after the crops are in . But one of the first thanksgivings in America had nothing to do with a good harvest . On December 4 , 1619 , the Pilgrims from England landed near what is now Charles City , Virginia . They knelt down and thanked God for their safe journey across the Atlantic . The first New England Thanksgiving did celebrate a rich harvest . The Pilgrims landed at what is now Plymouth , Massachusetts , in 1620 . They had a difficult time and the first winter was cruel . Many of the Pilgrims died . But the next year , they had a good harvest . So Governor Bradford declared a three - day feast . The Pilgrims invited Indian friends to join them for their special feast . Everyone brought food . In time , other colonies began to celebrate a day of thanksgiving . But it took years before there was a national Thanksgiving Day . During the Civil War , Sarah Josepha Hale persuaded Abraham Lincoln to do something about it . He proclaimed the last Thursday of November 1863 as a day of thanksgiving . Today , Americans celebrate this happy harvest festival on the fourth Thursday in November . Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving Day in much the same way as their American neighbors . But the Canadian thanks - giving Day falls on the second Monday in October .", "questions": "Which of the following is NOT true ?", "options": {"model": ["people have a good harvest as a day of gratitude .", "people have a good harvest on thanksgiving day .", "thanksgiving day is celebrated to express the american and indian people ' s thanks to god .", "the first new england thanksgiving was celebrated in the united states and canada ."], "human": ["Thanksgiving Day used to be a holiday to celebrate a good harvest .", "Abraham Lincoln was not the first to decide on thanksgiving celebrations .", "There ' s little difference between the American way and the Canadian way to celebrate Thanksgiving Day .", "Thanksgiving Day is celebrated to express the American and Indian people ' s thanks to God ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
