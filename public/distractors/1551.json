{"id": "1551", "article": "Eleven - year - old Angela was stricken with a debilitating disease involving her nervous system . She was unable to walk and her movement was restricted in other ways as well . The doctors did not hold out much hope of her ever recovering from this illness .

I moved , I moved ! \" Of course , at this very moment everyone else in the hospital was screaming , too , and running for cover .
