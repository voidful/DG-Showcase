{"id": "5676", "article": "The U . S . Department of Labor statistics show that there is an oversupply of college trained workers and that this oversupply is increasing . Already there have been more than enough teachers , engineers , physicists , aerospace experts , and other specialists . Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that are n ' t there . The result is that graduates can not enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree . On the other hand , there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts : carpenters , electricians , mechanics , plumbers , TV repairmen . These people have more work than they can deal with , and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates . The old gap that white - - collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true . The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen . The reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future . A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree . Parents begin indoctrinating their children with this myth before they are out of grade school . High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life . Under this pressure the kids fall in line . Whether they want to go to college or not does n ' t matter . Everybody should go to college , so of course they must go . And every year college enrollments go up and up , and more and more graduates are overeducated for the kinds of jobs available to them . One result of this emphasis on a college education is that _ . Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college , half of them do not graduate with their class . Many of them drop out within the first year . Some struggle on for two or three years and then give up .", "questions": "We can infer from the passage that the author believes that", "options": {"model": ["fewer people should go to college while more should be trained for skilled jobs", "more graduates should be trained to be trained", "more graduates should be trained for jobs", "more and more graduates will be trained"], "human": ["every young man and woman should go to college", "college education is a bad thing", "people with a college education should receive higher pay", "fewer people should go to college while more should be trained for skilled jobs"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
