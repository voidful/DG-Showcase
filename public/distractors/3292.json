{"id": "3292", "article": "The UK ' s \" hidden \" debt mountain stands at an estimated PS5bn , according to a new research today which reveals that as many as one in three consumers are keeping the full scale of their financial problems from their family . The research , for the Post Office , shows that while the average personal debt in the UK is PS9 , 731 . 51 , people only admit to owing half this when talking to a partner or member of their family . The new report exposes the serious emotional and physical consequences of covering up that debt , ranging from problems at work , sleepless nights and anxiety , to alcohol abuse . A recent report from the Commons public accounts committee said that in the UK , one person in 10 is struggling to manage their debts , while the total of all personal debt is some PS1 , 500bn . It warned that a government strategy to help consumers struggling with record levels of debt was \" seriously deficient \" because of poor management and a lack of leadership . The research was commissioned by the Post Office and carried out online by One Poll , which surveyed 2 , 258 UK consumers . Doug Strachan , director of financial services at the Post Office , said , \" The recession has put a massive strain on many families and people may be , for the first time , experiencing levels of debt that they can not control . The most important thing to remember is that if you do need to borrow money , make sure you are responsible about it and set out a clear repayment plan . Managing the debt effectively can mean there is no need to experience the terrible emotional and physical symptoms hiding debt can result in . \" Donna Dawson , psychologist specializing in personality , behavior and relationships , said the knock - on effects were enormous , \" hiding the extent of debt from a partner or family member may give us a false sense of control or independence , but the reality is that our mental and physical health suffers - - and once uncovered , the health of our loved ones suffers as well . The irony is that the very things we are trying to protect - - our trustworthiness and our good self - image - - are lost anyway , when all becomes revealed .", "questions": "This passage mainly tells the readers", "options": {"model": ["the bad effects of wasting money", "the effect of hiding debt", "the bad effects of spending money on money", "how to control their debts"], "human": ["the phenomenon of people ' s hiding debt in the UK", "the cause of people ' s hiding debt in the UK", "the measures of dealing with hiding debt", "the effect of hiding debt"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
