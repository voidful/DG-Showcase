There was a woman who lived there and whom I had never met , yet I could see her seated by her window each afternoon , sewing and reading . After several months had gone by , I began to notice that her window was dirty . Everything was unclear through the dirty window . I would say to myself , \" Why does n ' t that woman clean her window ? It really looks terrible . \" One bright morning I decided to clean my apartment , including cleaning the window . Late in the afternoon I finished the cleaning , I sat down by the window with a cup of coffee for a rest . What a surprise ! Across the way , the woman sitting by her window was clearly seen . Her window was clean ! Then _ . I had been criticizing her dirty window , but all the time I was watching hers through my own dirty window . That was quite an important lesson for me . How often had I looked at and criticized others through the dirty window of my heart , through my own shortcomings ?
