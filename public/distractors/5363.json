{"id": "5363", "article": "As I was reading a recent story in Slate on 20 - somethings complaining about how the economy was ruining their life plans , I could n ' t help but think the 20 - somethings sounded like a bunch of spoiled children who grew up expecting everything to be easy for them . As a 20 - something myself , I certainly share their disappointment : my husband and I probably wo n ' t be able to buy a house until we ' re in our 40s , and we too are burdened by student loans . But why should it be any different ? Being young persons in America , should n ' t they take up all of the challenges and opportunities that this country offers ? Consider some of these views shared in the Slate story : Jennifer , 29 , owner of a two - bedroom apartment with her husband , worries that she wo n ' t be able to have children for at least a decade because they ca n ' t afford to buy a house yet . I read that , and I thought , what planet is she living on where you need to own a house in order to have kids ? Has she ever visited a developing country , or even downtown areas in this one ? Home ownership is a luxury , not a fertility requirement . A 26 - year - old in the story despairs that he ca n ' t afford to get a Ph . D . in literature . Well , that sounds a bit like expressing disappointment that no one will pay you to write poetry on the beach in Thailand for five years . Yes , it ' s sad that these young people feel so lost . But I think the problem is their extremely high expectations , not economic reality . Beth Kobliner , author of Get a Financial Life : Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties , says that she thinks people ' s expectations are slowly adjusting , but today ' s 20 - somethings grew up at a time when everyone ' s wealth appeared to be expanding . Their parents probably saw their home values rise along with their investments . \" So you have people who have grown up in an environment where people had great expectations of what living well means , \" says Kobliner . This recession will certainly play a role in forcing those expectations into more", "questions": "Which of the following is not one of the complaints of the 20 - somethings ?", "options": {"model": ["they do n ' t care about their children ' s future .", "they ca n ' t afford to buy a house in their spare time .", "they have only one - bedroom apartment to live in ."], "human": ["They ca n ' t have children for at least a decade to buy a house .", "They ca n ' t buy a house until 40 because of student loans .", "They have only one - bedroom apartment to live in ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
