In the latest issue of Youth magazine , the mother shared the school advice she gave her daughters with young people across the country . \" I ' ve told my daughters many times that I do n ' t want them to choose a name , \" the mother said . \" I do n ' t want them to think , ' Oh , I should go to these top schools . ' We live in a country with hundreds of excellent universities . So the first question is : what ' s going to work for me ? \" \" When it was time to prepare for picking schools , nobody around me believed I could get into Xiamen University . But through hard work I finally made it , \" she continued . \" So , my second piece of advice is : believe in yourself , no matter what other people might say . Once your goal is set , you only need to try your best to make it come true . \" \" The last piece of advice is not to be worried even if your dreams do n ' t come true . As I ' ve said above , there are so many good universities out there . So it ' s important for everybody to understand that you can always find a university that gives you a great education . \"", "questions": "The mother shared her advice", "options": {"model": ["with the young", "in youth magazine"], "human": ["in Xiamen University", "in Youth magazine"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
