Then do you watch the popular program ? \" A Bite of China \" is a documentary on Chinese delicious food which has been broadcasted by Chinese central television . Is there any holiday that is n ' t celebrated with a special festival food ? Here are several traditional Chinese foods : Eggs hold a special meaning in many cultures , and China is no exception . The Chinese believe eggs mean producing something new . After a baby is born , parents may hold a \" red egg and ginger party , \" where they pass out eggs to announce the birth . In some areas of China the number of eggs represents the sex of the child , for example , an even number ( 1 , 3 , 5 , - - - ) for a girl , and an odd number ( 2 , 4 , 6 - - - ) if a boy has been born . Noodles are a symbol of longlife in Chinese culture . They are as much a part of a Chinese birthday celebration as a birthday cake with lit candles is in many countries . Since noodles represent long life , it is considered very unlucky to cut it off . Although westerners sometimes may be very sorry to see fish lying on a plate , in China a whole fish is a symbol of richness . In fact , at a party it is traditional to serve the whole fish last , pointed toward the valued guest . Fish also has a special meaning because the Chinese word for fish , yu , sounds like the word for richness or plenty , and it is believed that eating fish will help your wishes come true in the year to come . A very popular dish during the Dragon Boat Festival is Zongzi . This tasty dish is made of rice dumplings with meat , peanut or other delicious food in bamboo leaves . The tradition of Zongzi is meant to remind us of a great man , Qu Yuan . The 50 - minute program tries to bring something new by presenting more cultural elements , such as eating habits and the quality of eating .", "questions": "A girl has been born in Mr .
