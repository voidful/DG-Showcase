A researcher is hoping this advice will someday take hold , based on results of a \" science of honesty \" study she completed . Half of 110 participants were told to stop telling major or minor ( \" white \" ) lies for 10 weeks , while the other half ( the control group ) was given no special instructions about lying . The 110 people ranged from ages 18 to 71 and came from both sexes and all income levels . All came to a laboratory each week to complete health and relationship questionnaires and to take a test showing the number of major and minor lies they had told that week . When those in the no - lie group told three fewer white lies than in other weeks , they complained less of headaches , tenseness , anxiety and other problems than those in the control group . In addition , they reported that their close personal relationships had improved and their social interactions had gone more smoothly . \" The link was that clear , \" said study author Anita Kelly , a professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame , Indiana . \" Lying less was clearly associated with better health for those people . \" Previous research indicates that Americans average 11 lies per week , from the little white lies to save face or falsely praise others to major lies about serious matters . Kelly said her study differs from former studies because it did n ' t focus on how to detect a liar , but on the potential health consequences of telling lies . \" People might recognize the more harmful effect lying can have on relationships , but probably do n ' t recognize the extent to which it can cause a lot of stress , \" said Dr . Bryan Bruno at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City . At the end of the study , some participants had created smart ways to avoid lying . Kelly noted that some realized they could simply tell the truth about their daily achievements rather than exaggerate , while others responded to a troubling question with another question to take the person ' s attention away . They also stopped making false excuses for running late or failing to finish tasks . \" People usually think white lies are acceptable . In fact , white lies are trouble , not just major lies , \" Kelly said . \" As long as you like , you can find effective ways to avoid lying in many cases . It depends on you . \" \" But the goal does n", "questions": "The \" science of honesty \" study by Anita Kelly focused on", "options": {"model": ["the link between lying and health .", "the effect of white lies on health"], "human": ["the effect lifestyles have on health .", "the link between lying and health ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
