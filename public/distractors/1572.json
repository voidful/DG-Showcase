{"id": "1572", "article": "When you enter a crowded room or go on a picnic or to a party , who is the most attractive and appealing person ? It is the person who is cheerful , has a smiling face and behaves as if he or she is enjoying every moment of the event ! Such people have an optimistic opinion on life . They are the ones with a positive attitude . On the other hand , let ' s see that fellow in the corner with a long face . He is most probably thinking about the time and money wasted in having fun . He is a pessimist , one with a negative attitude . A person with a positive attitude gets on well with the job at hand . He does n ' t worry about what ' s gone before or what might happen in the future . If there is a problem , he quickly thinks of ways to solve it . If the problem can not be solved singly , he seeks help from someone else . He does n ' t feel that it ' s beneath his dignity to seek assistance . When Sonal lost her history notes days before an important examination , she sat down and cried . Then she pulled herself together , borrowed a friend ' s notes , worked day and night and managed to copy down whatever she had lost . Sonal passed the exam with flying color1s . It ' s just not possible , even for the greatest optimist , to smile all the time and feel good all day . Everyone has a period of blues now and then , when everything seems sad and without cheer . But once you develop a positive attitude , once you realize that life is a series of ups and downs , dark clouds and bright sunshine , in no time at all , you ' ve _ , ready to welcome the world again with open arms and a huge smile ! So from this moment on , keep your face to the sunshine and you ' ll never see the shadows .", "questions": "The case of Sonal suggested that", "options": {"model": ["a person who has a positive attitude should have a happy life", "a person may have a positive attitude", "a person with a positive attitude can solve the problem", "a person can solve the problem once he thinks of a way"], "human": ["Sonal made up for what she had lost by working day and night", "Sonal was a pessimist because he lost her history notes", "the history notes that she lost was not important for her", "a person can solve the problem once he thinks of a way"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
