{"id": "2318", "article": "The central government has announced its goal of providing everyone in the country with basic healthcare by 2020 . It ' s an ambitious goal for a nation that will have a population of 1 . 5 billion by then . Making healthcare affordable and easily available is the most important thing for many countries . But the task is much harder in China , the world ' s most populous nation . Gao Qiang , Vice Minister of Health , said , \" I think the goal of offering every Chinese basic healthcare is extremely large . It will be an arduous task . We have to make sure every citizen , including the huge rural population , will be covered . \" But the size of the population is only one of many difficulties . Gao Qiang said , \" The most obvious problem right now is that many people have no easy access to medical care . We still have a considerable number of city and rural residents who have not joined any medical insurance system . Moreover , medical services are public welfare services . We need to stop those hospitals that make profit by selling medicine . \" China started to reform its healthcare system in the early 1990s . Today , it has extended medical insurance to 170 million city residents . A rural cooperative medical insurance system was launched in 2003 to offer farmers basic healthcare . So far , more than eighty percent of the rural population have participated in the insurance scheme . And this year , unemployed city residents and children will also be covered by the system . Healthcare officials say their key work now is to help employees in small firms join the medical insurance system .", "questions": "Now their important work is to", "options": {"model": ["provide people with basic healthcare", "help people in small companies join the medical insurance system", "provide medical insurance for rural people"], "human": ["provide everyone in the country with basic healthcare", "offer farmers basic healthcare", "help people in small companies join the medical insurance system"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
