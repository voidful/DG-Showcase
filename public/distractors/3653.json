{"id": "3653", "article": "Cultural rules determine every aspect of food consumption . Who eats together defines social units . For example , in some societies , the nuclear family is the unit that regularly eats together . The anthropologist Mary Douglas has pointed out that , for the English , the kind of meal and the kind of food that is served relate to the kinds of social links between people who are eating together . She distinguishes between regular meals , Sunday meals when relatives may come , and cocktail parties for relatives and friends . The food served symbolizes the occasion and reflects who is present . For example , only snacks are served at a cocktail party . It would be inappropriate to serve a steak or hamburgers . The distinctions among cocktails , regular meals , and special dinners mark the social boundaries between those guests who are invited for drinks , those who are invited to dinner , and those who come to a family meal . In this example , the type of food symbolizes the category of guest and with whom it is eaten . In some New Guinea societies , the nuclear family is not the unit that eats together . The men take their meals in a men ' s house , separately from their wives and children . Women prepare and eat their food in their own houses and take the husband ' s portion to the men ' s house . The women eat with their children in their own houses . This pattern is also widespread among Near Eastern societies . Eating is a metaphor that is sometimes used to signify marriage . In many New Guinea societies , like that of the Lese on the island of New Ireland in the Pacific and that of the Trobriand Islanders , marriage is symbolized by the couple ' s eating together for the first time . Eating symbolizes their new status as a married couple . In U . S . society , it is just the reverse . A couple may go out to dinner on a first date . Other cultural rules have to do with taboos against eating certain things . In some societies , members of a family group , arc not allowed to eat the animal or bird that is their ancestor . Since they believe themselves to be children of that ancestor , it would be like eating that ancestor or eating themselves . There is also an association between food prohibitions and rank , which is found in its most extreme form in the caste ( social class ) system of India .", "questions": "According to the passage , who will NOT eat together ?", "options": {"model": ["men and women in a family .", "men and women in the southern countries .", "men and women in near eastern societies ."], "human": ["The English during regular meals .", "Newly - married people on the island of New Ireland .", "Men and women in Near Eastern societies ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
