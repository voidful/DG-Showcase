{"id": "4932", "article": "People can not reach an agreement on the use of science and technology . For example , will radiation from electronic equipment destroy the environment ? Should medical scientists change gene structures to prevent genetic disease or to create \" more perfect \" human beings ? While people are arguing about these and others , technology continues to influence our everyday lives - - the home , health and education , entertainment and communication , and so on . Some people carry on active social lives with computers - - their own or the ones in public places like cafes , social centers , libraries , and so on . Communicating with others in chat rooms , computer users can get to know people they might never meet in traditional ways . With live online video connections , two people with cameras in their computers can see and talk to each other from separate places . With modern telephone technology , most people stopped writing lettters - - especially personal letters and notes . But now , writing to communicate has returned in electronic form , or e - mail , which is a way of sending messages from one computer to another . For some computer users , the wish to communicate intelligently or creatively with others makes them want to write better . Computer technology has also made it possible to run a house electronically . From turning lights on and off to starting the coffee and cooking the hot meal , computers are taking care of people at home . Many modern machines have computer chips that allow their owners to program them . For instance , you can \" instruct \" a microwave oven how to cook a dish . Most entertainment equipment operates with computer technology too . Computers can even start cars automatically so that on cold winter mornings you can get into a warmed - up vehicle and drive off . Although much of the technology in our everyday lives has good effects , there are some uses that raise questions . For example , are interactive media ( i . e . , a combination of television , telephone , and computer ) going to control minds , cause people to forget about family life and personal relationships ? What effects will the genentic engineering of food have on people ' s health ? High - tech medical treatments can make a person live a much longer life , but can they improve the health and happiness of human beings ? Only time will tell , but , in the meantime , science and technology will continue to move forward .", "questions": "What is the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["computers change our living life", "computer technology and future", "computers change our lives"], "human": ["Science and New Technology", "Everyday Uses of Technology", "Computers Change Our Lives"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
