I like reading about the lives of great people . _ always gives me a lot of ideas on how to make my own life better . Great people are remembered not because they were handsome or beautiful , but because they did not give up when their lives were difficult . They used every opportunity to change their lives and make the world better . One good example is Orville and Wilbur Wright , the two brothers who invented the airplane . The plane has made the world into a small village . Hard work , not good luck , is the reason why the Wright Brothers could invent this convenient machine and become remarkable people . Today we still remember them when we see planes in the sky . When I feel sad , stories of great people always help me feel better . This is why I enjoy reading about great people ' s lives .", "questions": "Which book might the writer be most interested in ?", "options": {"model": ["michael jordan : the man who changed basketball history", "great people ' s life", "the story of great people"], "human": ["Ten Books That Have Made Our World Better", "Use Every Opportunity to Read in Your Free Time", "Michael Jordan : The Man Who Changed Basketball History"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
