{"id": "2919", "article": "I ' ve always felt a bit sad for weekend fathers , who are divorced and must maintain a bond with their children through visits on the weekend . Not having the opportunity for a lot of quality time , they go in for quantity giving lots of gifts and taking the children on non stop outings . But now I can understand . I ' m a weekend mom . My child , Henry , is a dog . Henry just returned to his father , Jack , after a happy stay with me . For ten days , I fed him the best food , canceled plans to stay home with him and let him sleep on the bed every night . Jack and I broke up a year ago . But neither of us wanted to part with Henry , so we share him . Not surprisingly , Henry is a willing participant in our contest for his love . Jack does n ' t let Henry sleep on his bed , so that ' s where I can always gain big points . I feed Henry higher quality food . I am always replacing his expensive \" thingy \" , a cotton knot he likes chewing on . It ' s his favorite toy , and the only one he has is at my house . Score another one for me . Jack now has a girlfriend , Lucy . At first she was afraid of dogs , which secretly delighted me . But that Henry , just trying to be polite ( the way I taught him to be ) , won her over . If truth be told , as time passes , there has been a slight change in Henry ' s behavior toward me . The worst was one day when Jack dropped him off for a two week stay . Henry and I were in the backyard playing as Jack was driving off . When he heard Jack ' s truck , he ran after it for two blocks until Jack had to stop and bring him back . That hurt , especially since I had friends over at the time . In a rare conciliatory mood , Jack said to me , \" You know , I ' m his best friend , but you ' ll always be his mom . \" Whatever it takes , I plan to make sure it stays that way .", "questions": "The writer feels hurt because", "options": {"model": ["jack does n ' t have enough time to take care of", "henry ' s attitude to her has changed slightly", "henry ' s father does n ' t let henry sleep on her bed", "henry is not polite to her"], "human": ["Jack has got a girlfriend", "Lucy does n ' t like Henry at all", "Jack does n ' t treat Henry as well as before", "Henry ' s attitude to her has changed slightly"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
