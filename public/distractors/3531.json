{"id": "3531", "article": "Have you ever noticed advertisements which say \" Learn a foreign language in 6 weeks , or your money back ! From the first day your pronunciation will be excellent . Just send . . . \" and so on ? Of course , it never happens quite like that . The only language that is easy to learn is one ' s mother tongue . And think how much practice that gets ! Before the Second World War people usually learnt a foreign language in order to read the literature of the country . Now speaking a foreign language is what most people want . Every year millions of people start learning one . How do they do it ? Some people try at home , with books and records of tapes ; some use radio or television programmes ; some use computers and network ; others go to evening classes . If they use the language only 2 or 3 times a week , learning it will take a long time , like learning a foreign language at school . A few people try to learn a language fast by studying for 6 or more hours a day . It is clearly easier to learn the language in the country where it is spoken . However , most people can not afford this , and for many it is not necessary . They need the language in order to do their work better . For example , scientists and doctors chiefly need to be able to read books and reports in the foreign language . Whether the language is learnt quickly or slowly , it is hard work . Machines and good books will help , but they can not do the student ' s work for him .", "questions": "Learning a foreign language is a hard job", "options": {"model": ["for most people", "for people"], "human": ["for those people at home", "for most people"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
