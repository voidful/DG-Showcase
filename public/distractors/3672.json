{"id": "3672", "article": "The vitamins necessary for a healthy body are normally supplied by a good mixed diet , including a variety of fruits and green vegetables . It is only when people try to live on a very _ diet , say that when trying to lose weight , that it is necessary to make special provisions to supply the missing vitamins . An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as \" beri - beri \" , which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer . In the early years of last century , a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri - beri . At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ . He was working in a Japanese hospital , where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain , it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest . Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard , which were fed on remains from the patients ' plates , were also showing signs of the disease . He then tried to separate the germ , which he thought was causing the disease , but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official , who ordered that the rice without coverings , even though left over by the patients , was too good for chickens . It should be recooked for the patients , and the chickens should be fed on cheap , rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain . Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet . He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice somehow prevented or cured beri - beri - - even that a lack of some ingredient in the coverings may be the cause of the disease . Indeed this was the case . The element needed to prevent beri - beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B . The milled rice , though more expensive , was in fact causing the disease the hospital was trying to cure . Nowadays , this terrible disease is much less common thanks to our knowledge of vitamins .", "questions": "What do we know about the disease beri - beri ?", "options": {"model": ["it caused the disease .", "it is not a common disease for beri - beri .", "it resulted from lack of vitamins .", "it is not a common disease ."], "human": ["It killed large numbers of people .", "It was transmitted by milled rice .", "It was caused by diseased chickens .", "It resulted from lack of vitamins ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
