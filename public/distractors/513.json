People of different ages , from 12 to 83 , were asked to have a test . During the test , these people were given all kinds of breakfasts , and sometimes they got no breakfast at all . Scientists wanted to see how well their bodies worked when they had different kinds of breakfasts . The rules show that if a person eats a right breakfast , he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast . If a student has fruit , eggs , bread and milk before going to school , he or she will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class . The result is opposite to what some people think .
