{"id": "286", "article": "Facebook is now used by 30 million people in the UK , about half the population . Joanna Shields , vice president of Facebook Europe , made the announcement this morning at a media conference in London . She said : \" We can announce today that we have reached 30 million in the UK , which we are really excited about . \" Globally , Facebook has more than 500 million registered users , a milestone it hit last summer . Last July , it also revealed that it had 26 million registered UK users . In the last eight months , it has attracted four million extra UK users , bringing the UK total to 30 million , while in January 2009 , Facebook had only 150 million registered users . Last year , Zuckerberg , Facebook ' s founder , said it was \" almost a guarantee \" that the site would hit one billion users . He explained : \" If we succeed in innovating , there is a good chance of bringing this to a billion people . . . it will be interesting to see how it comes true . \" One third of women aged 18 to 34 check Facebook when they first wake up , before even going to the toilet , according to research . Twenty - one per cent of women aged between 18 to 34 check Facebook in the middle of the night , while 42 per cent of the same group think it is fine to post drunken photos of themselves onto the social network , a study by Oxygen Media found . Shields was speaking this morning at the Financial Times Digital Media and Broadcasting Conference about the power Facebook ' s referrals can bring to media sites , such as newspapers and TV services . She explained that the average Facebook user has 130 friends who they share links to media sites with on a regular basis . \" Media companies which take advantage of that are really seeing the benefits \" , Shields said . Shields refused to say whether Facebook would develop its own mobile phone operating system and also said it was \" silly \" that Google had recently disabled the feature which allowed Google users to sync their contacts with Facebook friends .", "questions": "What is Joanna Shields content with ?", "options": {"model": ["fast growing registered users", "facebook users ' friends"], "human": ["the benefits of Facebook", "fast growing registered users"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
