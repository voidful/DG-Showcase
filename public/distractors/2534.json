My oldest we ' ve nicknamed the \" Evil Genius \" is ambitious , self - confident , and suffers no fools . Whenever we mentioned Santa my husband and I were rewarded with major eye rolling and deep sighs from my oldest . At first we both tried to ignore it . We both knew that our eldest had figured out the big secret . But I ' d be damned if he was going to ruin it for his six - year - old brother who had plenty of Santa - loving years ahead of him . I looked at my husband in the eye and said , \" I ' ll handle this . \" to which he responded \" Okay just be careful because I ' m not sure he knows - he might just be acting like it . \" But I knew .

I rushed into the play room where my oldest was playing alone . I looked him dead in the eyes and said : \" Well you know Santa is n ' t real , right ? \" And as I stared at my eight - year - old son for what seemed like a long time of silence , his eyes started to fill with tears .

Dad and I get some of them for you . So he ' s real . He ' s just got a little help from us . \" _ . He just sat there looking at me with an expression of doubt . You know when you make a terrible mistake but you ca n ' t stop yourself from making it worse ? That was me because I just had to know . I had to know why he had seemed to be over Santa . So I asked him why he rolled his eyes and sighed every time his father and I mentioned Santa .
