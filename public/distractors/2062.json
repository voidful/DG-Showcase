{"id": "2062", "article": "As South Africa starts to celebrate 20 years of freedom in South Africa , the moment is ruined with disappointment for many of the nation ' s poorest , who feel change has been slow to come . Today thousands of people are expected to gather near Cape Town to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Nelson Mandela ' s release . The moment when Mr . Mandela , who was 71 and had spent 27 years in prison on Robben Island , walked free marked a change from apartheid to multi - racial democracy . He went on to become the country ' s first black president . His African National Congress ( ANC ) party has reduced poverty , built houses and delivered water , electricity and schools to blacks . Still , though , needs remain great . With some observers comparing the event to South Africa ' s equal of the fall of the Berlin Wall , the occasion has sparked debate about unhappy promises and riots among the nation ' s very poorest , who feel short - changed . Agnes Ntali shares her two - roomed Department of Housing in Soweto with three grandchildren . The 55 - year - old widow , who first came to Soweto with her husband in the days after Nelson Mandela ' s release has been waiting 10 years to be re - housed . \" We have stayed here for a long time now but nothing has changed . Now we are free but we are not happy . . . we have no jobs and we are hungry , \" she told The Times newspaper . \" Since Mandela left , there have been no changes , \" she said . Last week the \" informal settlement \" she shares with several hundred other very poor black South Africans , broke out into violence . Tired of unhappy promises to provide electricity and toilets , some people cut off the power to new council houses nearby . A riot started and the police responded with teargas and rubber bullets . Across the nation , black townships are exploding in violent protests about services they are still waiting for . It is a sign that the poor are prepared to wait no longer for the better life which was forecast 20 years ago , but has , for thousands , failed to appear .", "questions": "What is the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["nelson mandela ' s role in south africa", "mandela ' s life in south africa", "the poor in south africa face broken dreams on mandela ' s anniversary", "the import of mandela ' s life in south africa"], "human": ["The Poor in South Africa Celebrate Mandela ' s Coming Back", "All the People in South Africa Started a Strike against the Government", "People in South Africa Help the Government Build a Bright Future", "The Poor in South Africa Face Broken Dreams on Mandela ' s Anniversary"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
