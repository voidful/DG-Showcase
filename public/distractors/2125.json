{"id": "2125", "article": "Once Dr . Mellinkoff invited me to join him at the hospital to discuss interesting cases with his students . The case at hand was a Guatemalan man , aged 34 , who had a fever and many other medical problems . His condition was not improving , and there was not much hope he would live . Dr . Mellinkoff asked to see the patient . He introduced himself in Spanish and , in a very gentle voice , asked how he felt . The patient smiled and said everything was all right . Then the doctor asked if he was able to eat . The patient said that he had no desire to eat . \" Are you getting food you like ? \" The patient said nothing . \" Do you get the kind of food you have at home ? \" The answer was no . The doctor put his hand on the man ' s shoulder and his voice was very soft . \" If , you had food that you liked , would you eat it ? \" \" Yes , yes . \" the patient said . The change in the patient ' s appearance could n ' t have been more obvious . Nothing was said , but it was easy to tell that a message had been sent and had also been received . Later , the doctor asked why the Guatemalan man was n ' t getting food he could eat . One of the students said , \" We all know how difficult it is to get the kitchen to make special meals . \" \" Suppose , \" the doctor replied , \" you felt a certain medicine was ly necessary but that our hospital did n ' t carry it , would you accept defeat or would you insist the hospital meet your request ? \" \" I would probably insist , \" the student said . \" Very well , \" the doctor said . \" You might want to try the same method in the kitchen . It wo n ' t be easy , but I can help you . Meanwhile , let ' s get some food inside this man as fast as possible , and stay with it . Or he ' ll be killed by hunger . By the way , there must be someone among you who can speak Spanish . If we want to make real progress , we need to be able to talk with him . \" Three weeks later , Dr . Mellinkoff told me that the Guatemalan man had left the hospital", "questions": "According to the passage , we can conclude that", "options": {"model": ["the hospital had n ' t enough medicine to eat .", "dr . mellinkoff had known the patient ' s appearance before .", "the patient was from another country .", "the doctor was n ' t getting the food the doctor ate ."], "human": ["the patient ' s illness was caused by hunger", "Dr .
