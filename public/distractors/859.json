{"id": "859", "article": "Some years ago I was offered a writing assignment that would require three months of travel through Europe . I had been abroad a couple of times , but I could hardly claim to know my way around the continent . Moreover , my knowledge of foreign languages was limited to a little college French . I hesitated . How would I , unable to speak the language , totally unfamiliar with local geography or transportation systems , set up interviews and do research ? It seemed impossible , and with considerable regret . I sat down to write a letter begging off . Halfway through , a thought ran through my mind : you ca n ' t learn if you do n ' t try . So I accepted the assignment . There were some bad moments . But by the time I had finished the trip I was an experienced traveler . And ever since , I have never hesitated to head for even the most remote of places , without guides or even advanced bookings , confident that somehow I will manage . The point is that the new , the different , is almost scary by definition . But each time you try something , you learn , and as the learning piles up , the world opens to you . I ' ve learned to ski at 40 , and flown up the Rhine River in a balloon . And I know I ' ll go on doing such things . It ' s not because I ' m braver or more daring than others . I ' m not . But I ' ll accept anxiety as another name for challenge and I believe I can accomplish wonders .", "questions": "The author accepted the assignment because", "options": {"model": ["he would learn something new and different by trying", "he did n ' t know how to travel through europe"], "human": ["he hardly knew any foreign languages", "he would learn something new and different by trying"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
