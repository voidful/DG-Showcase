{"id": "5329", "article": "Ms Petoskey , my seventh grade teacher at Queen of Apostles was , and still is , the greatest teacher . She was creative with her teaching styles ; every new day she brought a new way of leaning literature , by using a game rap song , and other things . I must say , the kids in my class sometimes did n ' t listen to the teachers carefully , but Ms Petoskey was able to attract their attention . Her literature classroom had bean bags and fun chairs to sit in while we read , and our desks were always set up in special positions - - all around the room . It looked messy when you walked in the room , but we liked it ! She let us choose who we sat next to , but once we talked too much , she would move us . She allowed us to make her classroom our home . She was passionate about her job . She let us choose the books we wanted to read next , which made me more interested in books . It was n ' t what we had to read , but what we wanted to read . Whenever we would present ideas about literature or poems , her eyes would light up and she would become excited . She always made sure everyone was having fun in her class and brought cakes to the classroom every Friday for our silent reading time . She was patient when we got out of hand ( , ) . She was always cheerful , which made me enjoy coming to school . Ms Petoskey is the teacher I still visit and chat with ( even after five years ) . She is the teacher I can thank for making me enjoy reading !", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that Ms Petoskey", "options": {"model": ["helps students to choose the books they want to read", "is a teacher who is good at reading", "allows students to read the books that they really want to read", "helps students to choose the right books"], "human": ["often has classes outside the classroom", "usually begins her class either with a game or a rap song", "often encourages students to read books as loudly as possible", "allows students to read the books that they really want to read"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
