{"id": "431", "article": "Just after my birth I remember lying in the stable with my mother and looking out the door , I could see a lovely , big field with trees around the edge and a good - sized pond to drink from . And there in the stable , while all of the other horses ate grass , I remember drinking my mother ' s milk . Usually , in the morning and afternoon , I would run with my mother or play with other young horses in the field . Sometimes , this play became too dangerous and my mother would come and take me away . The farmer was a good horse owner . He took good care of us all , but he seemed to prefer my mother to the other horses . And because I was her baby , he started to like me as well . Pretty soon I was eating grass like all of the other horses . Because I no longer needed her milk , and because she was his favorite horse , the farmer quickly put my mother back to work , pulling his carriage to and from the market , always coming back in the early evening . One evening I was playing with the other horses when my mother called me over to her . She told me that she never again wanted to see me playing so roughly with the others . I must grow up to be as wonderful as my ancestors , always working hard , walking proudly , and never hurting others . I promised her that I would do as she said . However , I had to admit that it was sometimes difficult to be kind to people like Dick , the worker - boy . He was always throwing rocks at us when he should have been picking fruit . We had to running around trying to avoid the rocks . Luckily , one day the farmer caught Dick behaving this way . The letter was given some money and then left the farm . That was the last time we ever saw the boy .", "questions": "My mother had to go back to work partly because", "options": {"model": ["i was old enough to eat grass", "i did n ' t like the farm", "i did n ' t want to grow up", "i did n ' t like the other horses at all"], "human": ["the horse owner no longer liked my mother", "I no longer needed my mother", "no other horses could help the farmer", "I was old enough to eat grass"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
