{"id": "1801", "article": "The latest research suggests that the key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not I . Q . , a generally bad predictor of success . Instead , it ' s purposeful practice . Top performers spend more hours practising their craft . If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop , you ' d take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability . It would n ' t have to be a big talent , just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction . Then you would want her to meet , say , a novelist , who coincidentally shared some similar qualities . Maybe the writer was from the same town , had the same family background , or shared the same birthday . This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self . It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join . It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12 , giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success . Armed with this ambition , she would read novels and life stories of writers without end . This would give her a primary knowledge of her field . She would be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings . Then she would practise writing . Her practice would be slow , painstaking and error - focused . By practising in this way , she delays the automating process . Her mind wants to turn conscious , newly learned skills into unconscious , automatically performed skills . By practising slowly , by breaking skills down into tiny parts and repeating , she forces the brain to internalize a better pattern of performance . Then she would find an adviser who would provide a constant stream of feedback , viewing her performance form the outside , correcting the smallest errors , pushing her to take on tougher challenges . By now she is redoing problems - - how do I get characters into a room - - dozens and dozens of times . She is establishing habits of thought she can call upon in order to understand or solve future problems . The primary quality our young writer possesses is not some mysterious genius . It ' s the ability to develop a purposeful , laborious and boring practice routine ; the latest research takes some of the magic out of great achievement . But it underlines a fact that is often neglected .
