{"id": "2151", "article": "Although there are many ways in which people communicate through speech , public speaking has probably received more study and attracted more attention than any other . Politicians winning an election , salespeople presenting products and etc . All depend upon this form of public communication . Even people who do not make speaking a part of their daily work are often asked to make public speeches : students at graduation , for instance , or members of churches , clubs or other organizations . Nearly everyone speaks in public at some time or other , and those who perform the task well often become leaders . There are many reasons for speaking in public . A public speaker may hope to teach an audience about new ideas , or provide information about some topic . Creating a good feeling or entertaining an audience may be another purpose . Public speakers , however , most often seek to persuade an audience to accept new opinions , to take certain actions , or to see the world in a new way . Public speakers usually know well in advance when they are scheduled to make a speech . Consequently , they are able to prepare their message before they deliver it . Sometimes , though , speakers must deliver the message unprepared , or off the cuff , such as when they are asked to speak at a wedding reception or to participate in an interview . When they do not have to speak unprepared , most speakers write their own speeches . Politicians and business managers sometimes employ professional writers who prepare their speeches for them . These professional writers may work alone or in small teams . Although the speaker may have some ideas into the contents of the speech , the writers sometimes have a great influence over the opinions expressed by their employers . Regardless of how a speech is prepared , the person who delivers it is given credit for its effect upon its hearers .", "questions": "No matter who writes a speech , the audience", "options": {"model": ["are asked to make a speech", "believe it expresses the speaker ' s idea", "are asked to listen to it", "have to listen to the audience ' s speech"], "human": ["do not believe what the speaker says", "know very well whom the speaker is", "know whose idea the speech really expresses", "believe it expresses the speaker ' s idea"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
