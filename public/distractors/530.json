Otherwise it will become a negative record in their personal credit reports , which are playing an increasingly big role in people ' s daily lives . A story carried by Chongqing Morning Post in June , underlines this trend . According to the report , a Chongqing student borrowed money from the bank to finance his university studies . After he graduated in 2005 , he went to work in Shenzhen . Later , he wanted to buy a house using loans . But several banks turned down his loan applications . The reason was that he had not paid back 1 , 500 yuan he borrowed from a bank when he was at university . A personal credit rating is becoming an essential \" pass \" in everyday life , as China establishes a nationwide credit database . Personal credit systems go back 150 years . In developed countries , enterprises and banks use them to decide whether or not to loan money or do other business with a person . A credit report estimates the credit worthiness of an individual , a company , or even a country . It is an evaluation made by credit bureaus of a borrower ' s overall credit history and his or her ability to repay debt . A poor credit rating means a high risk of defaulting on a loan , and thus leads to the refusal of a loan by the lender . Today in China , credit history in banks is the major content of a credit report . But in the future , reports will include information about the payment of telephone bills , water use fees , electricity and natural gas bills , and taxes , according to officials of the People ' s Bank of China , the central bank . Personal information such as appearance , genetic data , fingerprints , blood type , disease history , ethnic identity , family and religious beliefs are not to be included in credit reports , according to a draft regulation on credit rating issued last year by the Sate Council . The authors of the draft have just finished soliciting public opinions . The Credit Reference Center run by the People ' s Bank of China is in charge of developing a nationwide credit database . Credit reports for all people with bank transactions began in 2006 . A personal credit rating is important to the social and economic activities of a person . According to the draft , if you have a personal negative credit record , it will be kept for five years", "questions": "The author took the story as an example in order to", "options": {"model": ["show us that personal credit reports are important", "warn us of the importance of our personal credit report", "tell us how important our personal credit analysis is"], "human": ["encourage us to use credits widely", "inform us to apply for a loan at university", "warn us of the importance of our personal credit report"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
