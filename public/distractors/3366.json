Now , a study has found that while this is certainly true , men also have to deal with the fact that they are also more stupid than the fairer sex . In the study , scientists measured the IQ of 2500 brothers and sisters and they found an uneven number of men not only in the top two percent , but also in the bottom two percent . The study ' s participants were tested on science , maths , English and mechanical abilities . Though there were twice as many men as women in the smartest group , there were also twice as many men among the foolish . The total scores of men and women were similar . One of the study ' s authors , psychology professor Timothy Bates , said that the phenomenon may be because men have always been expected to be high achievers and women have been restricted to spend more time taking care of their home . \" The female developmental program may be tilted more towards ensuring survival and the safety of the middle ground . \" the Daily Mail quoted Professor Bates , of Edinburgh University , as saying . The research agrees with past results that men were more likely than women to receive first class University degrees or thirds and women secured the seconds . It has been said that men are more ready to take a risk when it comes to academics . While women have always been found to be steadier in their learning . A past study has shown that women are securing more firsts and seconds , while men are continuing to receive more thirds . The argument for the change is that the increase of coursework at the cost of exams favors women ' s steady approach .", "questions": "The purpose of the passage is to tell us that", "options": {"model": ["men and women have higher iq than women", "men are more likely to get higher scores than women in exams", "new fact about the iq of men and women has been found", "the iq of men and women has been done"], "human": ["men are smarter than women", ". men are more stupid than the women", "men are more likely to receive first class university degree", "new fact about the IQ of men and women has been found"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
