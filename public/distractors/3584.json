{"id": "3584", "article": "While others look away from trouble , this lady digs in and gets to work . Gretchen Buchenholz , the native New Yorker and mother of six , has worked on behalf of needy and margin1alized families for years in the city . She does everything from buy groceries for homeless families to start schools for children . In 1974 she founded Merricat ' s Castle , a nursery school that opened its doors to kids of all racial and economic backgrounds , the able - bodied as well as those with disabilities or terminal illnesses . She founded the Association to Benefit Children ( ABC ) , the nonprofit group , some 20 years ago . The story of how she started ABC is pretty amazing . In 1984 she was on her way to a government office to get a day - care permit when , by accident , she entered a room where homeless families were waiting to be placed in a \" welfare hotel . \" She saw three bare cribs with babies lying in them . The children wore no diapers ( their parents could n ' t afford them ) , and the room was filthy . After talking to the parents and learning that they and their children were hungry , Gretchen marched out and bought bread , peanut butter , apple juice and diapers . Then she started making phone calls . She dialed the American Red Cross , City Hall and The New York Times . Gretchen has made many people see that we need to recognize these children are not different from our own , and we need to join in and help . Too often , people look away from suffering . But she sets us an example that we should gain strength to do something about it .", "questions": "She went to the government office", "options": {"model": ["to buy bread , peanut , apple juice and diaries for children", "to ask the government for a day - care permission", "to get permission to look after babies during the day"], "human": ["to help those homeless people in the room", "to call on the government to help those homeless children", "to get permission to look after babies during the day"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
