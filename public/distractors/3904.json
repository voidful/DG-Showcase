{"id": "3904", "article": "It came as something of a surprise when Diana , Princess of Wales , made a trip t Angola in 1997 , to support the Red Cross ' s campaign for a total ban on all anti - personnel landmine landmines Within hours of arriving in Angola , television screens around the world were filled with images of her comforting victims injured in explosions caused by landmines . \" I knew the statistics , \" she said . \" But putting a face to those figures brought the reality home to me ; like when I met Sandra , a 13 - year - old girl who had lost her leg , and people like her . \" The Princess concluded with a simple message : \" We must stop landmines \" . And she used every opportunity during her visit to repeat this message . But , back in London , her views were not shared by some members of the British government , which refused to support a ban on these weapons . Angry politicians launched an attack on the Princess in the press . They described her as \" very ill - informed \" and a \" loose cannon \" . The Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms : \" This is a distraction , we do not need . All I ' m trying to do is help . \" Opposition parties , the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess . To make matters worse for the government , it soon emerged that the Princess ' s trip had been approved by the Foreign Office , and that she was in fact very well - informed about both the situation in Angola and the British government ' s policy regarding landmines . The result was a severe embarrassment for the government . To try and limit the damage , the Foreign Secretary , Malcolm Rifkidnd , claimed that the Princess ' s views on landmines were not very different from government policy , and that it was \" working towards \" a worldwide ban . The Defense Secretary , Michael Portillo , claimed the matter was \" a misinterpretation or misunderstanding . \" For the Princess , the trip to this war - torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause . She said that the experience had also given her the chance to get closer to people an their problems .", "questions": "Princess Diana paid a visit to Angola in 1997", "options": {"model": ["to express her worry about the british government ' s decision", "to support the british government ' s policy of protecting landmines", "to voice her support for a total ban of landmines", "to investigate the sufferings of landmines"], "human": ["to clarify the British government ' s stand on landmines", "to establish her image as a friend of landmine victims", "to investigate the sufferings of landmine victims there", "to voice her support for a total ban of landmines"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
