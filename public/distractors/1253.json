{"id": "1253", "article": "An experiment was carried out at British school into the performance of new pupils . At the start of the year , the pupils were each given a _ , ranging from \" excellent prospect \" to \" unlikely to do well \" . These were totally untrue ratings and did not reflect how well the pupils had previously performed . However , these ratings were given to the teachers . At the end of the year , the experimenters compared the pupils ' performance with the ratings . Despite their real abilities , there was an astonishingly high connection between performance and ratings . It seems that people perform as well as we expect them to . The Self - fulfilling Effect is also known as the Pygmalion Effect . This comes from an old Greek story . The story was also the basis of George Bernard Shaw ' s play \" Pygmalion \" , later turned into the musical \" My Fair Lady \" . In Shaw ' s play , Professor Henry Higgins claims he can turn a Cockney flower girl , Eliza Doolittle into a duchess . But , as Eliza herself points out to Higgins ' friend Pickering , it is n ' t what she learns or does that determines whether she will become a duchess , but how she ' s treated . The implication of the Pygmalion Effect for leaders and managers is massive . It means that the performance of your team depends less on them than it does on you . The performance you get from people is no more or less than what you expect , which means you must always expect the best . As Goethe said , \" Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is . Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be . \"", "questions": "The experiment was made in order to", "options": {"model": ["learn if expectations affect performance", "prove that the performance of a team has nothing to do with the school", "test the performance of a student"], "human": ["pick out the most excellent pupils", "give each pupil a proper rating", "learn if expectations affect performance"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
