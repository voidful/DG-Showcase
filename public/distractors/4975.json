{"id": "4975", "article": "If you ' ve been joining in chat room conversations , or trading e - mail with net pals , you have become one of the millions who write in a special , short form of English . Throughout the world , every night children and their elders are \" talking \" online - - many of them are talking at the same time . It ' s fast : trying talking to six people once . It ' s convenient : three or four words per exchange . It takes cleverness , concentration and quick fingers . And it requires very simple language . There ' s neither time nor space for explanations . Why waste valuable time telling six friends you have to leave for a moment to take care of your little brother when BRB ( = \" be \" right back ) will do ? Want to enter a conversation ? Just type PMFJI ( = \" pardon \" me for jumping in ) . Interested in whom you ' re talking to ? Type A / S / L , the common request to know your pal ' s age , sex and location . You may get 15 / M / NY as a reply from your pal . If something makes you laugh , say you ' re OTF ( = \" on \" the floor ) , or LOL ( = \" laughing \" out loud ) , or join the two into ROTFL ( = \" rolling \" on the floor laughing ) . And when it ' s time to get back to work or go to bed , you type GTG ( = \" got \" to go ) or TTYL ( = \" talk \" to you later ) . People want to write as fast as possible , and they want to get their ideas across as quickly as they can . Capital letters are left in the dust , except when expressing feeling , as it takes more time to hold down the \" shift \" key and use capitals . Punctuation is going too .", "questions": "The sentence \" There ' s neither time nor space for explanations \" means that", "options": {"model": ["there ' s no need to be a lot of words in the world", "people online have to express themselves in a simple way"], "human": ["people should know what time it is when they are talking", "people online have to express themselves in a simple way"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
