The rescuers confirmed her death by touching her through the gaps of the ruins . They shouted at the ruins again and again , knocked the bricks using various tools , but no reply inside . Then the rescuing team went to the next building . Suddenly the leader ran back , calling \" Come here . \" He came to the body , put his hands under the woman , feeling and touching , then shouted loudly and gladly , \" There is someone , a baby , still living . \" Through some efforts , rescuers cleaned up the ruins which blocked her . Under her body lay her baby , who was covered by a small red quilt . He was about 3 or 4 months ' old . Since well protected by his mother ' s body , he was safe . He was in a deep sleep when the rescuer carried him out , and his lovely and peaceful face warmed everyone around him . The doctor , along with the rescuing team , took the baby out of the quilt to check if the baby was all right , and he found there was a mobile phone in the quilt . The doctor looked at the screen ; a written message was already there : \" My dear baby , if you could live , don ' t forget how much I love you . \" As a doctor , he experienced much of this type of separation ; but at this moment , he cried .
