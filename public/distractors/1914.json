{"id": "1914", "article": "One of the most popular and enduring myths about depression is that depressed people are sad all the time - - and that by extension , people who are happy ca n ' t be experiencing depression , even if they say they are . It is a mistaken version of depression . Depression does n ' t make you sad all the time . When I ' m having a depressive feeling , I ' m not walking around in black clothes , and weeping . I go out with friends . I play jokes . I keep working , and have friendly chats with the people I work with . I read books . Above all , I experience moments of happiness . Yet I feel a strange conflicting pressure . On the one hand , I feel like I need to engage in a sort of sadness for people to understand that I really am depressed and that each day is a struggle for me . Because that way I will appear suitably sad , and thus , depressed - - and then maybe people will recognize that I ' m depressed and perhaps they ' ll even offer support and assistance . On the other hand , I feel an extreme pressure to perform just the opposite , because sad depressed people are boring and no fun , as I am continually reminded every time I speak openly about depression or express feelings of sadness and frustration . I ' m caught in a trap where if I do n ' t perform sadness , I ' m not really depressed , but if I express sadness at all to any degree , I ' m annoying and boring and should stop being so self - centered .

And many depressed people do n ' t actually spend it fainting dramatically on the couch and talking about how miserable they are .", "questions": "Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the writer thinks depression is a serious problem .", "the writer thinks depression is very important .", "depressed people do not always feel sad .", "the writer thinks depression can be developed ."], "human": ["Sad people are always depressed .", "Depressed people are sad all the time .", "Happy people will never feel depressed .", "Depressed people do not always feel sad ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
