{"id": "2105", "article": "A 26 - year - old Montreal man appears to have succeeded in his quest to barter a single , red paper clip all the way up to a house . It took almost a year and 14 trades , but Kyle MacDonald has been offered a two - storey farmhouse in Kipling , Sask . , for a paid role in a movie . MacDonald began his quest last summer when he decided he wanted to live in a house . He did n ' t have a job , so instead of posting a resume , he looked at a red paper clip on his desk and decided to trade it on an Internet website . The response was immediate - - a fish pen was offered for exchange . MacDonald then bartered the fish pen for a handmade doorknob from a potter in Seattle . In Massachusetts , MacDonald traded the doorknob for a camp stove . He traded the stove to a U . S . soldier in California for a generator . Then he exchanged the generator for an \" instant party kit \" - - an empty keg and an illuminated Budweiser beer sign . MacDonald then traded the keg and sign for a snowmobile . He bartered all the way up to an afternoon with rock star Alice Cooper , a KISS snow globe and finally a paid role in a Corbin Bernsen movie . \" Now , I ' m sure the first question on your mind is , ' Why would Corbin Bernsen trade a role in a film for a snow globe ? A KISS snow globe , ' MacDonald said on his website . \" Well , Corbin happens to be arguably one of the biggest snow globe collectors on the planet . Now , the town of Kipling , Sask . , Canada , with a population of 1 , 100 , has offered MacDonald a farmhouse in exchange for the role in the movie . The town is going to hold a competition for the movie role . MacDonald said : \" There ' re people all over the world that are saying that they have paper clips clipped to the top of their computer , or on their desk or on their shirt , and it proves that anything is possible and I think to a certain degree it ' s true . \" MacDonald , who has attracted international media attention in his quest , said the journey has turned out to be more exciting than the goal . \"", "questions": "Which statement about MacDonald ' s trades is TRUE ?", "options": {"model": ["it was offered for exchange for a movie .", "a film role was offered due to bernsen ' s hobby .", "it was offered for exchange for a part - time movie ."], "human": ["All of his trades were done in his country .", "The house in Kipling has been offered to MacDonald to attract media .", "A film role was offered due to Bernsen ' s hobby ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
