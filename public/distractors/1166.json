{"id": "1166", "article": "For 75 years , three words have influenced the lives of many young Brits . They are : mirror , signal , manoeuvre . These are the processes all drivers should perform . Learners hoping to pass their driving test need to prove that they understand the importance of these actions before they can throw out their L - plates and head for the highway . In Britain , L - plates ale signs with a red \" L \" on them which you attach to a car to warm other drivers that you are a learner . This summer the British driving test celebrates its seventy - fifth birthday . It ' s often described as one of the most frightening tests we face . It is a painful experience that does n ' t come very cheap nowadays . Taking the test in 1935 cost just 37 . 5 pence ; now candidates can expect to pay PS93 . The test is also harder than ever . In 1935 , the pass rate was 63 % ; now it ' s 43 % . In recent years , the DSA - - the organization that oversees the driving test - - has looked for ways to assess different aspects of what makes a good driver Now the DSA has announced that candidates will drive for ten minutes without detailed instructions from the examiner . DSA ' S chief driving examiner Trevor Wedge said the aim was to measure a candidate ' s ability to drive safely while making decisions independently . However , drivers will not be punished for getting lost . \" Candidates wo n ' t be failed for going off route , \" Mr . Wedge said . No doubt there will still be complaints . The BBC has learnt that in 2009 there were l , 889 complaints about examiners , of which just 51 were supported . Complaints that were rejected included ' ' Candidate crashed during test - - claims examiner distracted \" and \" Candidate says examiner took her on busy roads during rush hour , which was unfair \" . Someone else seemingly failed to understand the nature of an emergency stop when the complaint was filed that an emergency stop was conducted without warning .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["only a small number of complaints about examiners were supported", "more and more people are willing to attend the test in britain", "the british driving test is more expensive than the ordinary one", "the british driving test is more difficult than ever"], "human": ["examiners do n ' t take candidates on busy roads", "the pass rate of the driving test in Britain is 63 %", "the first British driving test took place in the 1920s", "only a small number of complaints about examiners were supported"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
