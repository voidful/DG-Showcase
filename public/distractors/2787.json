{"id": "2787", "article": "Good health is the most precious thing in the world . When you have got it , you never think about it . When you have n ' t got it , you think about it all the time . Our biggest enemies are not terrible diseases . We are our own biggest enemies because we sometimes destroy our own good health . Some of us eat too much , drink too much and smoke too much . And though our reason tells us we should control ourselves , we find it difficult . The fact is that most human beings need stimulation . Who does n ' t enjoy a drink after a busy day ? Only a smoker knows the pleasure of a cigarette with a cup of coffee . The danger is when these innocent pleasures run our lives and so destroy our health . When you find yourself eating between meals or eating too much rich food , when you can only keep yourself going by taking frequent drinks or by smoking one cigarette after another , then it ' s time to stop and think what you might be doing to yourself . The funny thing is that when we do n ' t control ourselves , simple pleasures are no longer simple pleasures . All right , I know what you ' re thinking . You ' re probably saying : \" It ' s all very well for him to talk , but I ca n ' t help myself . I need that extra bit of food , that extra drink , that extra cigarette . Life has so many pressures that I ca n ' t manage without them . \" But I ' m saying you can help yourself . Not only that you must help yourself . Because if you do n ' t help yourself , no one else can . So be your own best friend .", "questions": "\" I ca n ' t help myself \" means", "options": {"model": ["i ca n ' t control my own health", "i ca n ' t control myself"], "human": ["I ca n ' t do it myself", "I ca n ' t control myself"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
