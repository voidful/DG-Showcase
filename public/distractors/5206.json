{"id": "5206", "article": "Dear editor , I am Paul , a senior English teacher in Linchuan No . 1 Middle School in Jiangxi Province , China . This letter is written to ask for your opinion . The other day , I met with a multiple - choice exercise . We teachers argued heatedly with each other over its answer . Unfortunately , neither side could convince the other . The sentence is to be attached at the end of the letter . There is no doubt that the reference answer C is correct . But I do n ' t think it is the only answer . Personally , I do think A is also a reasonable choice in sense as well as in grammar , if the case is treated from another aspect . What puzzles me is why we should deal with so many multiple - choice exercises with not rigorous enough reference keys . But being a teacher , it ' s very important and necessary to make it clear to students which answer is correct , which is more appropriate , and which is the best one . Regrettably , Multiple - choice test , which is a bit old - fashioned in western countries , seems to be quite popular and covers a rather high percentage in all sorts of English tests in China , especially in NMET . Personally speaking , I do n ' t think multiple - choice test form making up more than 75 percent of the total scores in college entrance examination is a very good and effective testing method . Instead , more subjective testing forms depending on one ' s own thinking and his ability to use the language like key words falling , question answering , paragraph or passage summarizing , English - Chinese or Chinese - English inter - translation , etc . should be applied to English proficiency tests . Through the test forms mentioned above , students ' ability to use the language will be better developed . Consequently , more advanced and outstanding English learners could be picked out . In fact , a test paper focusing on multiple - choice test influences , in a sense , students to form their own language thinking , which hinders the development of their language ability as well . Do you think so ? I am looking forward to your authoritative opinion . Thanks . Yours sincerely , Paul Liao", "questions": "What can be learnt from the letter is that the writer", "options": {"model": ["does n ' t think highly of china ' s present english proficiency test forms", "does n ' t think it ' s a good way to make up more than 75 percent of the full scores in college entrance examination", "does n ' t think highly of china ' s present english guide scores", "does n ' t think it ' s a good way to make up more than 75 percent of the english tests"], "human": ["writes to argue with the editor over China ' s present test system", "thinks the reference answer to the sentence is completely wrong", "thinks subjective test forms constitute a rather high percentage in NMET", "does n ' t think highly of China ' s present English proficiency test forms"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
