{"id": "1986", "article": "For as long as they can remember Jynne Martin and April Surgent had both dreamed of going to Antarctica . This winter , they each made it to the icy continent as guests of the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) . Bm they did n ' t go as scientists . Martin is a poet and Surgent is an artist . They went to Antarctica as participants . in the NSF ' s Artists and Writers program . The NSF is thegovernment agency that funds scientific research in Antarctica . But it also makes it possible for artists , including filmmakers and musicians , to experience Antarctica and contribute their own points of view to our understanding of the continent . The mixing of science and art in Antarctica is n ' t new . Some of the earliest explorersbrought along painters and photographers . Edward Wilson was a British painter , doctor , and bird expert who journeyed with RobertFalcon Soott on two separate Antamtic expeditionsmore than 100 years ago . Herbert Ponting was a photographer who also accompanied Scott on one of those expeditions . In hundreds of photos , Pontingcaptured the beauty of the continentand recorded the daily lives and heroic struggles of the explorers . Today ' s scientists write articles forscientificjournals . Unlike theearly explorers ' journals , scientific papers can now be very difficult for non - scientists to understand . Writers in Antarctica workto explain the research to the public . Peter Rejcek is editor , writer , and photographer for the Antarctic Sun , an onlinemagazine devoted to news about the U . S . Antarctic Program . Rejeck began his career in the Antarctic in 2003 by spending a year at the South Pole . He has returned everyyear since , interviewing , scientists about research at Palmer , McMurdo , and South Pole stations . There are also scientists in Antarctica who work hardto explain their research to the public . Scientist Diane McKnight wrote The Lost Seal , a children ' s book that explains the research she and others are doing in an unusual ice - free area in Antarctica called the Dry Valleys . Antarctica is full of stories and wonders that are scientific , historic . and personal . People such as Martin , Surgent , Rejcek , and McKnight are devoted to bringing those storiesto asmany peopleare they can . \"", "questions": "What would be the best title for this article ?", "options": {"model": ["antarctica : a place for scientists to become", "antarctica : a land for all", "antarctica : a visit to antarctica"], "human": ["Antarctica : A Land of Beauty and Stories", "The NSF : A Program for Artists and Scientists", "Antarctica : A Land for All"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
