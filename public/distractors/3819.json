{"id": "3819", "article": "Until recently , women in advertisements wore one of three things - - an apron , an attractive dress or a frown . Although that is now changing , many women still feel angry about offending advertisements . \" This ad degrades women . \" they protested . Why does this sort of advertising exist ? How can advertisers and ad agencies still produce , sometimes , after months of research , advertising that offends the consumer ? The ASA , the body which deals with complaints about print media , is carrying out research into how women feel about the way they are pictured in advertisements . Its conclusions are likely to be what the advertising industry already knows : although women are often annoyed by the ads , few feel strong enough to complain . Women are not the only victims of poor and boring stereotypes - - in many TV commercials men are seen either as useless , childish fools who are unable to perform the simplest household tasks , or as inconsiderate fellows , always on the lookout for an escape to the pub . But it is women who seem to suffer more from the industry ' s inability to put people into an authentic present - day situation . Yet according to Emma Bennett , director of a London advertising agency , women are not aggressive or extremely angry about those stereotypes and sexist advertising . \" They just find it annoying or tiresome . \" She says that it is not advertising ' s use of the housewife role that bothers women , but the way in which it is handled . \" The most important thing is the advertisement ' s tone of voice . Women hate being insincerely praised or given desperately down - to - earth common - sense advice . \" In the end , the responsibility for good advertising must be shared between the advertiser , the advertising agency and the consumer . Advertising does not set trends but it reflects them . It is up to the consumer to tell advertisers where they fail , and the process of change will remain slow until people on the receiving end take the business seriously and make their - feelings known .", "questions": "Emma Bennett suggests that advertisement ought to", "options": {"model": ["change their way of advertising", "change their style rather than their content"], "human": ["sing higher praise for women than before", "change their style rather than their content"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
