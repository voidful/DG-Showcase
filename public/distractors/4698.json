By the end of April 2009 , a primary school student has to run 120kms in total / A middle school students have to run 240kms by that time . Since the campaign started , people have had different ideas about it . Some people think it is good for students . They think the campaign can make students healthier . Some students have little exercise and the campaign can make them run . But some people do n ' t think so . They think some schools do n ' t have enough place for students to do running . If students have to run on the road , maybe it is not safe . They also think there are many ways to become healthier ; running is not the only way . So they think the campaign is not a right decision .", "questions": "Why Chinese government started the running campaign ?
