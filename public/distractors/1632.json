Somehow this friendly kiss really made my day . I thought about his gentle kiss and appreciated the love . It ' s just a nice gift . Yesterday , I was on the telephone with my brother , and we spoke about our dad . He told me that one day , my dad was real sad . My brother had kissed his small child in front of my dad . Then with a tear in his eye , my daddy said to him , \" I wished I had more often kissed you all . \" My brother told him that it was n ' t too late , and that he could start that day . Now my dad greets each of us with a kiss and we know what he ' s trying to say . One day , sitting with my 82 - year - old dad , I noticed that he seemed to be a little bit in upset . The words he shared with me indicated that he was in a spiritual trouble , so I got up , kissed him on the cheek and hugged him from behind . I said Dad , ' you are good . ' And he agreed that he was blessed ( ) . He has a wonderful family given by God . As I looked into his eyes , I noticed that they began to be filled with tears of love and joy . That evening I grabbed my mom one day when my mom was busy in her usual way , I stopped her for a while , kissed her on the cheek and said \" Mom thank you for everything , \" and she said \" Oh , it ' s okay \" . She seemed to pull me back towards her as I pulled away . Thank you for that show of love is what she seemed to say . They are some people that I wish I would have kissed more , like my grandma in heaven that I can not hug anymore . So show your love , for gentle moments wo n ' t come once they have gone", "questions": "What ' s the main idea of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s important to show love to your parents .", "never wait until tomorrow to express love to others .", "it ' s important to express love to others ."], "human": ["You can create a better world by kissing .", "Love for family is equal to that for friends .", "Never wait until tomorrow to express love to others ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
