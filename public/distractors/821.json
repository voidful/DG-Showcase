{"id": "821", "article": "People who have a fear of ugly insects will want to stay far away from Lake Tawakoni State Park in north Texas , US . A giant spider web was recently found there . The thick web is swarming with millions of little spiders . Stretching across several acres it blankets a number of trees , bushes and even the ground . While the web may make some people nervous , it has become a big attraction for others - especially for unlucky insects . \" At first , it was so white that it looked like fairyland , \" said Donna Garde , the park ' s manager . \" Now it ' s filled with so many mosquitoes that it ' s turned a little brown . \" Most spiders work alone , which is why the discovery of the huge web has caused such a stir . Scientists across the country have been debating its origin . Some spider experts ' say the monstrous web may have been weaved by social spiders . Social spiders work together to build larger webs to catch small insects . However , those webs take years to build . Park officials say this web was formed in just a few months . Others say it could be the work of millions of tiny ballooning spiders . These types of spiders ' fly ' by throwing out thin threads of silk , which they use to ride air currents . In 2002 , a similar giant web made by ballooning spiders was discovered in a field in Canada . Texas entomologist Herbert Pase says the giant web is very unusual . \" From what I ' m hearing , it could be a once - in - a - life - time event , \" he said . But John Jackman , an entomologist and professor at Texas A & M University , disagrees . Jackman says he hears reports of similar webs , like the one in Canada , every few years . \" There are a lot of folks that do n ' t realize spiders do that , \" he said . \" Until we get some samples sent to us , we wo n ' t know what species of spider we ' re talking about . \" Park officials expect the web to last until fall", "questions": "Which of the following will John Jackman most probably agree to ?", "options": {"model": ["there are a lot of spiders that are similar to spiders in the us .", "there are a lot of spiders that are similar to spiders .", "there are many spiders ' flys on the web .", "it is not very uncommon for spiders to weave big webs like that ."], "human": ["Possibly such a big web can only be seen once in one ' s whole life .", "The web will be there as long as the weather is warm enough .", "A lot of spiders will die off for the sake of the big web .", "It is not very uncommon for spiders to weave big webs like that ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
