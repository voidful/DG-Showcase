{"id": "3844", "article": "As more people use smart phones to pay bills and store personal information , strict password security has become more important than ever . A new study shows that free - form gestures - sweeping fingers in shapes across the screen of a smart phone - - can be used to unlock phones . These gestures are less likely to be observed and reproduced by others than traditional typed passwords . \" All that it takes to steal a password is a quick eye , \" said one of the researchers of the study . \" With all the personal information we have on our phones today , improving their security is becoming increasingly necessary . \" In developing a secure solution to this problem , the researchers studied the practicality of using free - form gestures . With the ability to create any shape in any size and location on the screen , the gestures were popular as passwords . Since users create them without following a template , the researchers predicted these gestures would allow for greater complexity . The researchers carried out a create - test - retest experiment where 63 people were asked to create a gesture , recall it , and recall it again 10 days later . The gestures were captured on a recognizer system designed by the team . Using this data , they tested the complexity and accuracy of each gesture using information theory . The result of their analysis is that people are favorable to use free - form gestures as passwords . To put their analysis into practice , the researchers then had seven students in computer science and engineering , each with considerable experience with touchscreens , attempt to steal a free - form gesture password by observing a phone user secretly . None of them were able to copy the gestures with enough accuracy . The gestures appear to be extremely powerful against attacks . Though the testing is in its early stage and widespread adaptation of this technology is not yet clear , the research team plans to continue to analyze the security and management of free - form passwords in the future . They believe this is the first study to explore free - form gestures as passwords . They will soon publish their findings .", "questions": "The main purpose of the text is to", "options": {"model": ["explain the use of free - form gestures", "introduce the study of a new password", "persuade people to use free - form gestures", "explain how to use a personal information"], "human": ["advise people to use free - form gestures", "discuss whether smart phones are safe", "talk about the practicality of passwords", "introduce the study of a new password"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
