{"id": "466", "article": "Hoffman , 40 , a former senior vice president of a financial company , had what she describes as \" one of those extreme jobs . \" \" I loved working , \" she says . But her career path reached a crossroad when her second child was born , and she left her job in February 2007 . Hoffman is one of many people who have left the work force to take a break , but she has a position as a consultant . She has described this type of career detour - - - - - which is more common for women than for men - - as \" off - ramping . \" Typically it occurs when the balancing act of parenting and work becomes too tough . A study by the center found that more than 90 percent of women who off - ramp want to on - ramp back into the work force eventually . But making the transition back to work is rarely easy , and it is even harder in this economic climate of layoffs and hiring freezes . Considering some of the obstacles faced by on - rampers , a three - day program called \" Greater Returns : Restarting Your Career \" was held at Columbia University . The goal of the three days was to have them walk away with a big shot of confidence . According to one school of thought , women looking to make a comeback might even have an advantage in the current economy , especially if they are looking for part - time or consultant positions that do not offer benefits . And a majority of on - rampers are women with extensive working experiences that could give them a slight advantage over less - experienced competition . \" You absolutely can not be defensive about why you off - ramped , \" Ms Hoffman says , \" defensive \" would have put her into a hard situation if the Greater Returns program had had not taught her how to describe the years she spent at home . \" I now feel confident talking to an employer and saying , ' Yes , I have been out of the work force , but here is where I can make significant contributions .
