{"id": "3482", "article": "One Saturday morning Ann was going on business . Before starting , she took her son Sam to her friends , Bill and Kate , and asked them to look after him for the day . Sam , an independent boy of six years old , had black hair and was wearing a pair of jeans and a bright yellow shirt . At eleven o ' clock Bill took Sam into town . Sam walked along behind Bill , looking at the windows of all the shops they passed . After lunch they went to the park and walked about . The whole place was very crowded . Bill stopped to buy some chocolate . When he turned round to give some to Sam , the boy was n ' t there . Bill ran round calling Sam , but he could n ' t find him . About an hour later , just in front of a shop , he saw the black hair , the pair of jeans and the bright yellow shirt . The boy looked as if he was waiting for someone to come out of the shop . Bill ran across the road , took the boy by the hand and hurried off , as it was quite late . The boy began to cry and pull hard , but Bill , who did n ' t know much about children , could n ' t understand a word the boy was saying . All the boy made was a lot of noise . When they got home at last , Bill went straight to the kitchen , with the boy still crying . At the door Bill stopped with an amazed look . There , sitting at the kitchen table with Kate , was a small boy with black hair , in a pair of jeans and a bright yellow shirt .", "questions": "Why did Ann take Sam to Bill and Kate ?", "options": {"model": ["because ann was too busy to look after sam .", "because ann was thinking about the boy ' s story .", "because bill was n ' t at the shop .", "because sam did n ' t want to be a boy ."], "human": ["Because Sam wanted to play with them .", "Because Bill and Kate wanted to see Sam .", "Because Sam ' s father was n ' t at home .", "Because Ann was too busy to look after Sam ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
