{"id": "2070", "article": "\" Just take a deep breath . \" \" Do n ' t think about it . \" \" You ' re more likely to die in a car wreck on the way to the airport than you are in a plane crash . \" These are just some words given to people with a fear of flying . But as Tom Cruise , playing Lt . Daniel Kaffee in the movie A Few Good Men , said , \" I get sick when I fly because I ' m afraid of crashing into a large mountain . I do n ' t think Daniel will help . \" But there ' s a new application that just may . Today , the VALK Foundation , a Dutch group that ' s a partnership between KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the University of Leiden , launches the app in the US . The VALK Foundation was one of the first centers for research and fear - of - flying treatment in the world and is the organizer of three world conferences on fear of flying . The foundation said the app , called Flight App VALK , is the first scientifically - developed , web - based treatment for people who suffer from mild to moderate fear of flying . \" The fear of flying application we have created aims to transfer all of the knowledge we have developed through our program into a mobile application that will help ease travelers ' fears , \" said Dr . Lucas van Gerwen , director of the VALK Foundation . Dr . van Gerwen is also a psychologist and professional pilot with more than 30 years experience . The foundation said up to 30 % of adults are fearful fliers . The Flight App is designed to help relax passengers before and during flights by educating users about flight safety and turbulence . It explains the sounds and sensations they can expect during departure , flight and landing . And , if a passenger ' s flight stress reaches a panic level , they press a special panic button which provides audio and written information to help decrease stress levels . Most importantly , the Flight App can be used during the flight in the airplane mode . Once downloaded , the program does not require Internet connection in the air .", "questions": "Flight App VALK is aimed to", "options": {"model": ["help people in the flight", "help relax passengers before and during flights", "help people with a fear of flying", "help people learn about plane safety"], "human": ["help passengers experience the fear of flying", "treat people who suffer from mild fear of flying", "teach people the basic knowledge of taking flight", "help relax passengers before and during flights"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
