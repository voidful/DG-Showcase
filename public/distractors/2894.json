{"id": "2894", "article": "How much rain has fallen on the earth in the past ? Man has not always kept weather records . Because scientists need a way to learn about past rainfall , they study the tree rings . A tree ' s trunk keeps growing year by year . Under its bark , a tree adds a layer of new wood each year it lives . If you look at a tree stump , you can see the layers . They are called annual ring . On some trees , all of the rings are of the same width . But the ponderosa that grows in the American southwest have rings in different withes . The soil in he southwest is dry . The pines depend on rainfall for water . In a year of good rainfall , they form wide rings . In a dry year , they form narrow ones . Scientists do not have to cut down a pine to study its rings . With a special tool , they remove a narrow piece of wood from the trunk without harming the tree . Then they look at the width of each ring to see how much rain fell in the year it formed . Some pines are hundreds of years old and have hundreds of rings . These rings are from an annual record o0f past rainfall in the southwest .", "questions": "On the whole , the passage is about", "options": {"model": ["how scientists use tree rings", "how scientists grow tree rings", "why scientists study tree rings"], "human": ["why the tree trunks grow bigger", "trees that lived hundreds of years ago", "why scientists study tree rings"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
