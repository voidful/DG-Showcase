{"id": "1386", "article": "\" How was school , Ben ? \" I asked my grandson after he began kindergarten this year . \" The work is too long . . . and there ' s not enough time to play , \" he replied . I could n ' t help but remember Ben ' s own mother , my daughter , Jane , and her reaction to the first day of school . Julie was also disappointed with the first day of school and so was her little sister . My three - year - old daughter announced angrily after her big sister got on the big yellow school bus , \" I want to go ' sool ' and you not let me ! \" When Julie returned home that afternoon , I asked her the same question that I asked Ben , \" How was school , Julie ? \" Julie replied , \" I did n ' t learn to read today . \" This year as the school bus passed my house , my mind went back to those school days again . I could almost smell the chalk dust in the air . I also wonder what the children these days manage to get chosen to do in order to get out of school for a few moments since there are no erasers to clean . It was fun to be \" chosen \" for eraser cleaning duty . This was a task finished by going outside and beating erasers together while sneezing and coughing . No wonder so many babies now have allergies , and it ' s simply because we all have chalk dust in our lungs ! On the first day of school , the expectation was so great that I would be ready long before it was time to leave for school . We did n ' t have backpacks because we had cigar boxes . We carried our small supplies inside a cigar box from one of the local stores . We saved the cigar boxes and used them from year to year until they fell apart . The first day of school was exciting . It was a new beginning . The doors of knowledge had been opened . The first day of school is an event in our lives that most of us remember . It ' s a big step for a small child toward leaving babyhood and so \" there is n ' t enough time to play \" .", "questions": "In the opinion of the author , the first day of school is", "options": {"model": ["a big step for a child to leave", "the beginning of great learning", "a big day for school"], "human": ["a day when a child is the happiest", "a day when a child does much work", "the beginning of great learning"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
