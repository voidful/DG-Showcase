Some seem like they could help him learn strategy . But I worry others may be too violent ornumb his mind . Cecilia Some games may improve kids ' hand - eye coordination and problem - solving skills .

Others , though , do n ' t have such benefits , and violent video games have been shown that they might increase kid ' s aggressive behavior . Like a lot of aspects of raising kids , when it comes to video games , the healthiest approach is actually self - control . The American academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommends that kids should spend no more than 2 hours each day on screen time , including watching TV or movies , or playing computer or video games . So consider setting limits at least that strict to keep game playing from affecting their schoolwork , household responsibilities , and the physical activity your son needs very day . Make sure that he ' s playing games which are suitable for his age group . All video games are rated and labeled by the Entertainment Software Rating Board . Steer clear of any rated \" M \" for mature . Those are for ages 17 and older and can contain heavy - duty violence , strong language , and sexual content . Try to keep the video gameconsole in a common area of the house , not your son ' s room . That way you can catch any inappropriate content in the games he ' s playing , and he ' ll be in a position to interact with others in the house while he ' s playing . Make sure your son has appealing alternatives , too , such as sports , activities , opportunities to socialize with peers ; and downtime to be creative .
