It has a modern sound that makes people very excited . In the 1920s jazz sounded like America . And So it does today . The origins of this music are as interesting as the music itself . Jazz was produced by American blacks , who were brought to the Southern States as slaves . They were sold to plantation owners and forced to work long hours in the cotton and tobacco fields . This work was hard and life was short . When a Negro died , his friends and relatives formed a group to carry the body to the cemetery . A band often went with them . On the way to the cemetery the band played slow and sad music . But on the way home the mood changed . _ Everybody was happy . Death had removed one of their members , but the living were glad to be alive . The band played happy music , which made everyone want to dance . It was an early form of jazz . Music has always been important in their lives . Coming mainly from West Africa , the black men who were brought to America already possessed a rich musical tradition . This music centered on religious ceremonies in which dancing , singing , clapping and stamping to the beat of a drum were important forms of musical expression . As these people settled in to their fields , they made up work songs . Singing made the hard work go faster . Another musical form that helped to develop jazz was the blues . Blues songs always describe something sad - - an unhappy love affair , a money problem , bad luck . To this day , the expression \" feeling blue \" means being sad .", "questions": "Which of the following is true according to the text ?", "options": {"model": ["jazz was born in africa .", "there are many different forms of music in the us .", "jazz was first produced by black slaves .", "jazz was created by black people ."], "human": ["Jazz follows European traditions .", "Jazz always describes something sad .", "Blues made the hard work of those slaves go faster .", "Jazz was first produced by black slaves ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
