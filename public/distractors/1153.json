{"id": "1153", "article": "China is having such a huge influence on the United States that many Americans are struggling to learn the Chinese language in a bid to keep competitive . \" Interest in learning Chinese among American youth and their parents has grown quickly in the past five years , \" said Vivien Stewart , vice president at the Asia Society . China ' s quick rise to near - superpower and its effects politically , economically and culturally are driving the American ' s interest to learn the language , experts say . From kindergartens to high schools , studies by the Asia Society show , there is a \" rapid rise \" in interest among pupils to study the Chinese language . \" The Chinese rich cultural traditions and _ economy mean that it is now important for all of our students to be better prepared , \" said Michael Levine , Asia Society ' s executive director of education . A survey found that 2 , 400 high schools - an unbelievably high number - would be interested in offering the Advanced Placement ( AP ) courses in Chinese language and culture when the courses become available in 2016 . China , the world ' s most popular nation , is important to the United States because it is a leading trader , consumer and investor . Its political influence is also rising across the world . It has replaced the United States as the world ' s largest consumer and could become the second largest economy in the world , after the United States , in the next two to three decades . Even though the US State Department has described the Chinese language \" critical \" to national prosperity and security , \" the current facilities to support recruitment of students and teachers as well as the growth of high quality programs is terribly not enough , \" an Asia Society study says . The Society has set an aim of having at least five percent of American high school students learning Chinese by 2015 . \" Millions of Chinese are learning English , but only 24 , 000 Americans are learning Chinese , \" said Andrew Corcoran of the San Francisco - based Chinese American International School . The most popular languages after English in US schools at present are Spanish and French while Japanese is the most popular Asian language .", "questions": "What is the best title for this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the chinese language is popular", "the chinese language gets more popular", "more and more americans learn the chinese language"], "human": ["Foreign Language Learning", "Difficulties in Learning the Chinese Language .", "The Chinese Language gets More Popular"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
