But ever since then the little boy has set about learning how to make money by selling drinks , delivering newspaper and buying stocks . The American had already earned $ 9 , 000 ( equal to $ 90 , 000 today ) by the time he graduated from the high school . And this month the 78 - year - old , who earned his fortune by making a lot of sound investment in the stock market , took the place of Microsoft founder , Bill Gates , as the world ' s richest man . Gates ' worth declined $ 1 . 5 billion to $ 55 . 5 billion in 33 days after the recent financial storm , according to Forbes Magazine . Buffett , the only son of a stockbroker , was ready to think outside the box to develop his business from a very early age . At 8 , he went to golf courses collecting and selling the used balls . At 11 when he sold soda pop door - to - door with a friend , the pair collected lids on streets to judge which flavor was the most popular . As a paper boy during high school , Buffett delivered two competitor papers , so that even when customers canceled one of the subscriptions , he could still make a profit from the other . With his paper delivery savings , Buffett bought 162 , 000 square meters of farmland and collected rent . Young Buffett stepped into the stock market at 11 but earned only $ 5 . The experience taught him one of the virtues in investing patience . After graduating from university , Buffett started his venture with stocks with his childhood earnings and money from friends . He researched the stocks and just bought those of solid companies that were undervalued and inexpensive at the time . By sticking to companies such as American Express and Coca - Cola , Buffett has become rich . \" Learning is important to Buffett ' s success . He is a learning machine who can spend his entire day reading . He keeps learning from books , street smarts and investigation , from both success and failure . In this way , he over achieved his aptitude , \" said Charlie Munger , his longtime business partner .", "questions": "What can we infer from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["buffett has a good sense of business .", "buffett ' s mother had a good sense of business .", "buffett ' s father is the only son of a stockbroker ."], "human": ["Buffett is an immediate success in the stock market", "Buffett and Gates are business partners .", "Buffett has a good sense of business ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
