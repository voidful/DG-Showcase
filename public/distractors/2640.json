{"id": "2640", "article": "Long ago , poems were recited out loud instead of being written down . When the Greeks first started the Olympics , they held poetry contests as well as athletic competitions . Now , poetry competitions have been revived . This year 120 , 000 high school students competed in the first Poetry Out Loud National Recitation Contest , performing poems from memory for $ 100 , 000 in prizes . The first competitions were held in classrooms . The winners went on to school - wide contests , and then they competed in city and state competitions . Finally , the 50 state champions , along with the District of Columbia champion came to Washington , D . C . last week for the last show down . After the 51 champions competed against one another , 12 went on to the finals . Then the field was narrowed to five . The final five had one last chance to \" perform \" a poem . The overall champ , Jackson Hille , a high school senior from Ohio , won a $ 20 , 000 scholarship . The National Endowment for the Arts and the Poetry Foundation started Poetry Out Loud because they realized that hearing a poem performed is a different experience from reading it on a page . It ' s not just a matter of saying the words in the right order . It ' s the tone of voice , the pauses , the gestures , and the attitude of the person performing that bring the words to life . \" Each time we hear somebody recite a poem , we find something fresh and interesting about it , \" says National Public Radio Broadcaster Scott Simon , master of ceremonies for the finals . Hearing it in a new voice offers something new to the listener . Not only do the people hearing poems have a new experience , memorizing and presenting poems helps the participants understand those poems in a new way . Another benefit of a competition such as Poetry Out Loud is that the participants learn public - speaking skills that can help them for life .", "questions": "One benefit the participants get from poem recitation competitions is that they can", "options": {"model": ["become skilled in speaking in public", "recognize the poems in a new way"], "human": ["write good poems themselves", "become skilled in speaking in public"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
