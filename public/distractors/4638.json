{"id": "4638", "article": "The motivation to succeed comes from the burning desire to achieve a purpose . Napoleon Hill wrote , \" whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe , the mind can achieve . \" A young man asked Socrates the secrets to success . Socrates told the young man to meet him near the river the next morning . When they meet , Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river . When the water got up to their necks , Socrates took the young man by surprise and pressed him into the water . The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy stared turning blue . Socrates pulled his head out of the water and the first thing the young man did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air . Socrates asked , \" What did you want the most when you were there ? \" the boy replied . \" Air . \" Socrates said , \" That is the secret to success . When you want success as badly as you wanted the air , then you will get it . There is no other secret . \" A burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishment . Just like a small fire can not give much heat , a weak desire can not produce great results .", "questions": "Why did Socrates do and say that to the young man ?", "options": {"model": ["because he wanted him to understand what he needed for success .", "because he wanted the young man to know the secret to success .", "because he wanted him to do the same thing for success ."], "human": ["Because the young man was too foolish to understand him .", "Because the young man made him angry .", "Because he wanted him to understand what he needed for success ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
