{"id": "4056", "article": "Success does not belong to a select group of individuals . Success belongs to those who are willing to go after it and try their best to do what they have to do . Here are some useful practical ways for you if you want to be a success . Desire . Desire is the strong wish to achieve a goal . Without desire you have nothing . Before you can run with desire , your goal must be plain , clear , and it must also be exciting . Show up . Seventy percent of success in life is showing up . You ca n ' t have a best seller , if you have never written a book . You ca n ' t get your dream job , if you ' re afraid to turn in an application . Showing up does n ' t guarantee success , but if you do n ' t show up , you wo n ' t succeed . Fail . Unless you ' re willing to have a try , fail unhappily , and have another try , success wo n ' t happen . To have success you have to do things the right way , but often the only way to do something right is to first fail at it . As Thomas J . Watson said , a simple formula for success is to double your rate of failure . So welcome failure , become a student of failure , learn from failure , and soon you will succeed . Work Harder . _ Success is not about doing what the common person ca n ' t do . It ' s about doing what the common person is unwilling to do . And on a deeper level , it ' s about creating habits that the common person is unwilling to create . It ' s the habit of doing things with excellence that causes success . Enjoy the Journey . Success is a journey , not a destination . Success is not a certain car or a certain house or a certain happy marriage . Success is the enjoyment of the journey . You have to enjoy the journey . Someone once said , \" Unless you change how you are , you will always have what you ' ve got . \" You have to change , you will change , and you will succeed .", "questions": "The best title of the passage might be", "options": {"model": ["how to make success a success", "how to make success", "how to get success", "the five main steps to success"], "human": ["The Importance of Success", "The Meaning of Success", "Success or Failure", "The Five Main Steps to Success"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
