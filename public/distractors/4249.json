Chai Jing , a former news interviewer with CCTV , discussed the questions in her documentary Under the Dome . The 103 - minute film was on websites on Feb 28 . In the film , Chai visits polluted places and talks to officials and scientists . She thinks that burning too much coal and oil are the main causes of PM2 . 5 and smog .

In her film , Chai also emphasized that everyone can do something to help control smog too . For example , we can live a greener life by using more public transport . Or if we see things that could harm the environment , we can try to stop it . In the film , when she sees a restaurant cooking without any suitable filter facilities , she calls the hotline 12369 .
