However , schools , particularly universities , may not only spread culture ; they may add to the cultural heritage . Today American society places a good deal of emphasis on the development of new knowledge , especially in the physical and biological sciences , medicine , and engineering . In recent years , the nation ' s leading universities have increasingly become research centres . An emphasis on research has led universities to judge professors not by abilities as teachers , but as researchers . Promotions , salary increases , and other benefits have long been dependent on research and publication . However , the most important is no longer publishing . To be successful these days , professors have to bring in money provided by government and private industry . Critics claim that academic success is most likely to come to those who have learned to \" ignore \" their teaching duties to pursue research activities . Defenders say that even when students themselves are not involved in research projects they benefit from such an emphasis on research . Major research universities like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have also cooperated with industrial companies to develop technology and products with commercial potential . With university - industry ties continuing to grow , debate has increased about the consequences for basic science , academic openness , the control of information , the direction of research , and the influence on students .", "questions": "Supporters of the present emphasis on research argue that", "options": {"model": ["students need n ' t worry about their teachers ' work", "it does good to students anyway"], "human": ["it earns a lot of money for a university", "it does good to students anyway"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
