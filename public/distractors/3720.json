{"id": "3720", "article": "It is difficult for doctors to help a person with a damaged brain . Without enough blood , the brain lives for only three to five minutes . More often the doctors ca n ' t fix the damage . Sometimes they are afraid to try something to help because it is dangerous to work on the brain . The doctors might make the person worse if he operates on the brain . Dr . Robert White , a famous professor and doctor , thinks he knows a way to help . He thinks doctors should make the brain very cold . If it is very cold , the brain can live without blood for 30 minutes . This gives the doctor a longer time to do something for the brain . Dr . White tried his idea on 13 monkeys . First he taught them to do different jobs , and then he operated on them . He made the monkeys ' blood go through a machine . The machine cooled the blood . Then the machine sent the blood back to the monkeys ' brains . When the brain ' s temperature was 10degC , Dr . White stopped the blood to the brain . After 30 minutes he turned the blood back on . He warmed the blood again . After their operations the monkeys were like they had been before . They were healthy and busy . Each one could still do the jobs the doctor had taught them .", "questions": "The biggest difficulty in operating on the damaged brain is that", "options": {"model": ["dr . white has no time to do the work", "the time is too short for doctors"], "human": ["the blood - cooling machine might break down", "the time is too short for doctors"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
