{"id": "3555", "article": "The concept of health holds different meanings for different people and groups . These meanings have also changed over time . This change is no more evident than in Western society today , when notions of health and health promotion are being challenged and expanded in new ways . For much of recent Western history , health has been viewed in the physical sense only . That is , good health has been connected to the smooth mechanical operation of the body , while ill health has been attributed to a breakdown in this machine . Health in this sense has been defined as the absence of disease or illness and is seen in medical terms . In the late 1940s the World Health Organization challenged this physically and medically oriented view of health . They stated that health is a complete state of physical , mental and social well - being and is not merely the absence of disease ( WHO , 1946 ) . Health and the person were seen more holistically ( mind / body / spirit ) and not just in physical terms . The 1970s was a time of focusing on the prevention of disease and illness by emphasizing the importance of the lifestyle and behaviour of the individual . Specific behaviours which were seen to increase risk of disease , such as smoking , lack of fitness and unhealthy eating habits , were targeted . Creating health meant providing not only medical health care , but also health promotion programs and policies which would help people maintain healthy behaviours and lifestyles . While this individualistic healthy lifestyle approach to health worked for some ( the wealthy members of society ) , it was of little benefit to people experiencing poverty , unemployment , underemployment or who had little control over the conditions of their daily life . During the 1980s and 1990s there has been a growing swing away from seeing lifestyle risks as the root cause of poor health . While lifestyle factors still remain important , health is being viewed also in terms of the social , economic and environmental contexts in which people live . This broad approach to health is called the socio - ecological view of health . At the Ottawa Conference in 1986 , a charter was developed which outlined new directions for health promotion based on the socio - ecological view of health . This charter , known as the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion , remains as the backbone of health action today . In exploring the scope of health promotion it states that : Good health is a major resource for social , economic and personal development and an important dimension of the quality of life .
