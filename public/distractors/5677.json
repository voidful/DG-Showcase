Many students know that if they want to get ideal jobs with good salaries , they must do well in high school so they can enter good universities . Therefore , they spend all day studying without time to relax . However , not all students can go to top universities even if they work very hard . Students are pressurized by parents and teachers who are just concerned about their studies and exam scores while ignoring their hobbies and individual differences . As a result , students are forces to work harder and harder . Furthermore , there is pressure coming from students themselves . They realize they have a slim chance of getting into a top university as competition is fierce . So , they put a lot of stress on themselves and stay in a nervous state day after day . If they keep it up , they ' ll suffer illnesses ; both psychological and physical . What students need is relaxation . This does n ' t mean that they should give up their ambitions and stop studying hard . It means \" work while you work , play while you play \" . If you can do this , you will improve your health greatly . You ' ll feel yourself suddenly fresh , just like recovering from a terrible illness . You ' ll find that your studies are not a burden anymore .", "questions": "What trouble have both the parents and teachers brought to the students ?", "options": {"model": ["they have little time to relax .", "they give too much burden for them to bear .", "they do n ' t care about their studies and exam scores .", "they put a lot of stress on themselves and stay in a nervous state day after day ."], "human": ["They do n ' t know how to let the students relax .", "They do n ' t love those who work the hardest .", "They fail to understand what the students need most .", "They give too much burden for them to bear ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
