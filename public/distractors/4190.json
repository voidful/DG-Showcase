Liangliang called the police to take his mother away - - such a \" good reason \" to call the police . Most people would just laugh it off . However , it shows that something is wrong with our education . It rings alarm to our Chinese parents to think about it . Parents should ask themselves why they ' re so angry when their kids want to watch cartoons instead of doing homework . Kids are supposed to be simple and naughty . They can just ask their kids to do things they expect them to do . Schoolwork is important but a healthy childhood is much more important . If they push their kids too hard , the kids will not listen to them . Instead , parents should spend some time talking to their kids and help them grow in a good way . It ' s also a good way to help parents themselves to grow , too . In China , lots of parents care more about scores than any other things . They hope their kids can be top students and go to the top colleges . Curriculum Reformation is coming though , and it would bring some changes to our schools . It ' s also time for parents to change their minds to reduce pressure on their kids and help them to grow happily and naturally .", "questions": "The main idea of the passage is that", "options": {"model": ["parents should help kids grow healthily and properly", "parents should change their minds to keep kids healthy", "parents should help their kids grow in a good way", "parents should help kids to grow happily and naturally"], "human": ["kids can call the police if they are angry with their parents", "parents should not care about scores any more", "kids should be allowed to watch cartoons", "parents should help kids to grow happily and naturally"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
