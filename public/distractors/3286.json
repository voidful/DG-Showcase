Rao ' s , the East Harlem restaurant with a history of more than l00 years , is simply the toughest restaurant to get a reservation in the US , if not the world . Michelin three - star restaurants like elBulli in Spain , often ranked the world ' s top restaurant , would sell out the second phone lines opened . But in the case of Rao ' s , the phone lines never open . There are about a dozen tables in the tiny restaurant , and each is spoken for , semi - permanently , as regulars have had their reservations for years , and when they ca n ' t use them , they often gift them to friends . The place is so small that the owners rarely have the flexibility to do favors even for people they know . Since it is always busy , there has never been a need for publicity . The last remarkable national review of the restaurant came from The New York Times more than 35 years ago . It was already tough to get a table at Rao ' s but reservations have been non - existent ever sincce the magic review . According to a critic who is \" very , very lucky to have dined at Rao ' s a few times , \" the experience rivals the tasty food . There are no menus at Rao ' s , and one of the owners will pull up a chair and run through the massive list of options , allowing people to have diner by mixing and matching nearly any ingredient with any classical Italian style of cooking . The place does n ' t take credit cards , is n ' t open on weekends or for 1unch , and \" at some point during your meal the one - room restaurant will almost unavoidably break out in song . \" It is truly one of a kind , \" the critic wrote .", "questions": "Which is probably the best title for thistext ?", "options": {"model": ["a legendary restaurant", "a restaurant"], "human": ["The best restaurant", "A legendary restaurant"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
