Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history . Do you think of yourself as a bit of an expert at board games like chess or Go ? Maybe you ' re not quite as good as you think . New research from the University of Manchester and Oxford suggests complex games like these are impossible to learn fully . They may even be too complex for the human mind to understand . Researchers studied two - player games , to try and understand the strategies which people use to make decisions during the game . Some games with two players are simple , with only a small number of possible moves . Players can quickly work out the best strategy but that means the game soon becomes boring . It gets more interesting when there are many possible moves . That ' s why people are so fascinated by complex board games like chess or Go , or some card games . But what the researchers found was that with difficult games , players find it hard to work out the best strategy and their actions become less reasonable . This research is part of the field called game theory : the study of human strategic decision - making . Much thinking on how people play complex games is based on something called \" the balance point \" , which is when players have a perfect knowledge of what they are going to do and of what their rivals are going to do . When you add more than two players then of course the game becomes even harder to understand . Trading on the stock market is an example of a complex multi - player game .", "questions": "If players want to get to the balance point , they should", "options": {"model": ["figure out the next actions of themselves and their opponents", "change the plan of the game and play it", "change the plan of the game"], "human": ["ask other players to work out the best strategy", "have a good knowledge of the games they are playing", "figure out the next actions of themselves and their opponents"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
