{"id": "774", "article": "The use of the word imitation reminds me that we ought to make some more comments on the risk of people imitating what they see on the screen in the way of crime or violence . First there was always a risk of children acting out scenes which could be dangerous . For example , I remember a woman who was head of a middle school telling me that she had happened to look out of her window when the children were on the playground and had seen them putting a small boy on a chair with a rope round his neck and the rope over the branch of a tree ; fortunately she was in time to get there before the child was hanged . I remember a film in particular in which the hero who was imprisoned had escaped by electrocuting his guard , the technique of doing this being shown in detail . This was the kind of scene which we could cut for these reasons . In films for young people and adults we always tried to keep off the screen the details of criminal techniques , such as how to open a locked door with a piece of hard plastic or how to open a safe ; if we were consulted before production , I used to advise that the details should not be shown . When I gave talks in prisons about film checking I had full support for this , since fathers who were in prison for criminal offences did not want their children to get on crime . Every time I gave a talk in a prison someone used to mention the French film Rififi . made by Jules Dassin in 1954 . This remarkable film showed in great detail a robbery of a jeweler ' s shop , the robbery lasting about half an hour and being backed by only natural sound . . . one of the most brilliant film sequences of all time . I remember our discussion at the time . We thought that the robbery was finished only with the use of advanced and obviously expensive equipment and that only the most experienced and skilled criminals could possibly imitate it ; we believed therefore that it was ly safe . When talking in prisons some years later I learned that there had been several robberies in which the techniques had been copied , so perhaps we were wrong .", "questions": "The writer thinks that", "options": {"model": ["there should be no more robberies on the screen than in the way of crime", "the criminals should not be allowed to give up the crime", "people should not be shown in the film", "the details of the crime should not be shown on the screen"], "human": ["the details of the criminal technique should be kept", "children should not imitate what they see on the screen", "it is dangerous to imitate what they see on the screen", "the details of the crime should not be shown on the screen"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
