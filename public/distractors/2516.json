{"id": "2516", "article": "A good reader becomes sooner or later a good book buyer . The sooner , the better . The reading done in a book drawn from a library can not be so pleasant at the moment nor so permanently useful as the reading done in our own copy . A book which is worth reading is likely to be read more than once , and at each reading some idea or some statement makes such an impression that we wish to refer to it again . Some readers underline the page as they read , but I find that a page which I have underlined can not give me so many fresh impressions as one which has no marks on it . My habit is to make my own index of a book as I read . I put down the number of the page and a word or two to identify the thought or the fact which I get from it . On a second or third reading I am likely to double or triple the size of this index . This is my substitute for underlining . Most of the books in my library are so indexed that I can find quickly the passage which from time to time I wish to look up . To use a book in this way , organizing it for continued usefulness year after year , we must , of course , do our reading in a copy which belongs to us . The books I buy are chiefly those of less expensive editions . As I have grown older and the number of books on my shelves has increased , I appre - ciate editions which do not take much room . By careful and continuous selection I keep my librarv down to ten thousand books . This would be , of course , too large a number for any but a professional scholar or writer . But my advice to a book lover is to weed but his library at least once every two years , giving away the books which are not likely to be read again . And never never buy a book which you will not immediately read . A library bought only for looks is not literature , but indoor decoration .", "questions": "What would the author ' s index look like after a third reading ?", "options": {"model": ["it contains different kinds of words .", "it contains the number of the page and 3 to 6 words .", "it contains the number of the page and a word .", "it includes the number of the pages in 1 . 5 to 10 , 000 books ."], "human": ["It contains the number of the page and a word or two .", "It numbers the page , the paragraph and the lines .", "It fills the cover of the book with numbers and words .", "It contains the number of the page and 3 to 6 words ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
