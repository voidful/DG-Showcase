A group of 22 energy - saving policemen went to work last week in Beijing . They go around the city to see the use of energy in hotels , office buildings , shopping centers and other public places . One of their aims is to make sure that these places have set their air conditioning no cooler than 26degC . They also set up a special phone line so that people can tell them which buildings fail to follow the rule . \" If everyone sets their air conditioning at 26degC , Beijing will save 400 million kilowatthour of electricity in one summer . That ' s one - third of all the usages of the city in the season , \" said a TV advertisement . Other Chinese cities , like Wuhan in Hubei Province and Yangzhou in Jiansu Province , are going to follow Beijing ' s steps in setting up a similar police team . As one of the fastest developing countries , China is using a lot of energy . This has a great effect on the country ' s environment and limited energy . From 1986 to 2005 , the country experienced 20 warm winters continuously . Numbers show that Chinese cities have to spend billions of yuan solving environmental problems every year . At the beginning of this month , China made its first action plan to fight pollution . It aims to reduce energy usage by 20 % and increase renewable energy up to 10 % from 7 % by 2010 . To introduce the public to a green life , last week Beijing held a show on energy - saving technology and productions . Environment - friendly machines , such as a vending machine that helps collect used bottles , have attracted lots of attention . \" We want to tell people that there are certain ways to protect the environment . Each of us can find effective ways to do it on our daily lives , \" said Liu Qianguang , an environmental engineer in Beijing .", "questions": "According to Liu Qianguang ,", "options": {"model": ["a lot of people in beijing are interested in energy", "it ' s easy for one to do something good for the environment", "a lot of people in china can get used to the energy"], "human": ["there are few ways to protect the environment", "it ' s difficult to find good ways to save energy", "it ' s easy for one to do something good for the environment"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
