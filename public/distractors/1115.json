{"id": "1115", "article": "Is early childhood education really necessary ? Early childhood education primarily focuses on learning through playing to develop the child ' s physical , sensory , communicational and social development . Early childhood education has become a concern of the government , who pushes poor children to be formally trained before they are old enough for kindergarten . There are good reasons for the government to push early childhood education . Studies have shown that orphaned children who did not receive good care and education become developmentally delayed causing failure in school , and even in life . Further studies show that poor children who take part in Head Start programs are more prepared for school , less likely to end up in Special Education classes , and are less likely to receive public help or go to jail ( prison ) . There are also negative parts to putting a child in formal education programs too early . Time Magazine Online explains that \" the younger the child is , the less his chances of catching up with first - grade work . \" I have personally witnessed many children of my generation who went to Head Start programs become frustrated and bored with school before they finished high school . Yet parents have been sure that the earlier the child starts school , the better off he or she is , so they push to start children earlier . Actually while early formal education of poor children does show great gains in the early elementary years , studies also show that this head start is really a \" false start \" , as the gains are lost in middle and high school years . It seems that environment is a bigger factor on life ' s success than early education . Head Start programs have not achieved its original goal in closing the achievement gap in poor and middle school children . Perhaps it is time to find other ways to close that gap .", "questions": "The explanation of Time Magazine Online suggests that", "options": {"model": ["the early childhood education is not important to the children ' s growth", "the early childhood education is very important to the children", "the early childhood education is helpless to the child ' s grade", "the early childhood education is helpful to the child ' s academic development"], "human": ["it is good for the young children to receive early education", "the early education can help the children follow the grade", "the younger the children are , the more clever they will be", "the early childhood education is helpless to the child ' s grade"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
