You might not think of plants as dangerous , but in this case they are threatening nature ' s delicate food chain . The invaders are plants brought here from other countries to make gardens and yards look pretty . Ever since people started to arrive on America ' s shores , they have carried along trees , flowers , and vegetables from other places . Now there are so many of those plants , they are crowding out the native plants that have lived here since before human settlers arrived . And that ' s a problem , says Dr . Doug Tallamy . He ' s insect expert at the University of Delaware . He explains that almost all the plant - eating insects in the United States are specialized , which means they eat only certain plants . Monarch butterfly caterpillars , for example , dine on milkweed . If people cut down milkweed and replace it with another plant , the butterflies will not have the food source that they need to survive . But the trouble does n ' t stop there . When insects ca n ' t get the right plants to eat and they die off , then the birds do n ' t have enough bugs for their meals . Tallamy points out that almost all migrating birds depend on insets to feed their young . \" We can not let the plants and animals around us disappear . \" says Tallamy , \" The way to preserve them is to give them food to eat . But when we plant non - native plants , we are _ the food chain , because then we do n ' t have the insects the birds need to live . \" Fewer of the right plants mean fewer bugs , and fewer bugs mean fewer birds . And that ' s bad for the Earth , because we need a variety of living things to keep the planet healthy and beautiful . The good news is , garden centers sell native plants . \" Just Google ' native plants ' and your location , and you can find out which plants really belong where you live , \" says Tallamy", "questions": "We can know whether a plant is native by", "options": {"model": ["eating only some plants", "googling on the internet"], "human": ["asking Dr .
