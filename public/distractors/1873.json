{"id": "1873", "article": "How to deal successfully with a child who shows outstanding musical ability ? It ' s not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift . Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their children ' s need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour . And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are specially able in academic subjects , the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school - - especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity . Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school . The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction . They aim to provide an environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians . Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities , for example , individual lessons , orchestras , chamber groups , voice training , conducting and theory . They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms , sometimes with a teacher . The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects : English , maths , basic sciences and languages . All five British specialist schools are independent , classes are small by normal school standards , with a high teacher / pupil ratio . Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders , leaving home to live , eat and sleep fulltime at school . What are the disadvantages ? An obvious problem is the cost ; the fees are high ( PS12 , 000PS17 , 000 a year for boarders ) . However , each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance , to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees . Secondly , not all parents want to send their children to boarding school , especially at a very early age . Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment . They stress , however , that their main aim is to turn out \" rounded and wellbalanced \" individuals . There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress . Early signs of musical ability may disappear in their teenage years , while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to", "questions": "What makes specialist music schools different from other schools ?", "options": {"model": ["the music schools are more than five .", "a range of musical training is offered .", "only a small part of their lessons can be offered ."], "human": ["More than half the day is spent on music .", "The children have mostly onetoone lessons .", "A range of musical training is offered ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
