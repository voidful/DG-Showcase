{"id": "3021", "article": "Farm - raised pigs are dirty , smelly animals that get no respect . They ' re also an environmental hazard . Their manure contains phosphorus , which , when it rains , runs off into lakes and rivers , consuming oxygen , killing fish , stimulating algae overgrowth and emitting greenhouse gases . Doing away with the pig is not an option . Pigs provide more dietary protein , more cheaply , to more people than any other animal . Northern Europe still maintains the highest pig - to - human ratio in the world ( 2 - 1 in Denmark ) , but East Asia is catching up . During the 1990s , pork production doubled in Vietnam and grew by 70 percent in China - - along densely populated coastlines , pig density exceeds 100 animals per square kilometer . The resulting pollution is \" threatening fragile coastal marine habitats including mangroves , coral reefs and sea grasses , \" according to a report released in February by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations . As it turns out , there is a solution to the pig problem , but it requires a change of mind - set among environmentalists and the public . Two Canadian scientists have created a pig whose manure does n ' t contain very much phosphorus at all . If this variety of pig were adopted widely , It could greatly reduce a major source of pollution . But the Enviropig , as they call it , is the product of genetic modification - - which is anathema to many Westerners . The Enviropig is one of many new technologies that are putting environmentalists and organic - food supporters in _ : should they remain categorically opposed to genetically modified ( GM ) foods even at the expense of the environment ? Elsewhere , trees grown for paper could be made amenable to much more efficient processing , reducing both energy usage and toxic chemical bleach in waste water from paper mills . The most significant GM applications will be ones that help lessen the problem of agriculture , which accounts for 38percent of the world ' s landmass and is crowding out natural ecosystems and species habitats . Chances are , farmers will continue to grow their polluting organic pork , their allergenic organic soy and their neurotoxin sprayed organic apples . Worse still , they will make sure that no one else gets a choice in the matter of improving the", "questions": "What is the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["whether to choose the gm foods", "how to make gm foods more efficient", "the future of gm foods"], "human": ["How to Raise Pigs", "The Pollution Brought by Pigs", "Whether to choose the GM Foods"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
