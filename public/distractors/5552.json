Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cargo was destroyed in the Oct . 28 explosion due to An \" equipment failure \" , said Orbital Sciences , the company hired by NASA for the resupply mission . The rocket was carrying a cargo ship loaded with 2 , 200 kilograms of supplies such as food , tools , parts , and experiments . Roughly a third of the cargo was a series of scientific investigations . Some of them were from high school students in the US . For example , 10 students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory School of Houston were conducting experiments about microgravity and put their samples on the rocket . \" I know that failure is a part of science , but I really feel sorry for my students , \" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston , Chronicle . Astronauts at the ISS felt a more urgent disappointment , however . The cargo included 617 kg of food . Now they will have to rely on supplies from a Russian launch on Oct . 29 . Launched in 1998 and involving the US , Russia , Canada , Japan , and the member countries of the European Space Agency , the ISS is one of the most ambitious international collaborations in history . Currently , there are six astronauts at the station , five male and one female . Three are from Russia , two are from the US , and one is from Germany . They have lived together for about six months . The station gets regular resupplies from Earth , using unmanned spacecrafts . Food is always a big part of the supplies . Most of the food is frozen and ready to eat , and often tastes bad - somewhat like trying to eat when you have a heavy cold . To make space life better , however , scientists have made breakthroughs . Earlier this year , Russian astronauts managed to grow a variety of crops aboard the station . Next year they are going to try to grow rice and other plants .
