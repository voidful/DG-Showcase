{"id": "1781", "article": "Every year there are hundreds of earthquakes in different parts of the world . In September , 1923 , Tokyo and Yokohama were both destroyed by an earthquake and the fires that followed it . They had to be completely rebuilt . One of the most serious earthquakes was in China ' s Shanxi province in 1556 . It killed almost one million people . We measure an earthquake ' s strength on the Richter Scale . The Richter Scale was introduced in 1935 in Southern California in the USA . It measures earthquakes on a scale of one to ten . Any earthquake measuring five or more is usually serious . The Earth ' s crust is made up of rock called plates . As these plates move , they sometimes crash against each other , causing the crust to quake . In cities such as Tokyo , where small quakes happen quite often , many modern buildings are designed to be flexible so when the Earth moves , they move with it . Earthquakes can also break up gas and oil pipes . This can cause fires to break out , which can do as much damage as the earthquake itself . Another effect of earthquakes is _ These are huge waves created by earthquakes beneath the sea . They can be many meters high and cause great damage to coastal towns and cities , China , Japan , Russia and the USA have the highest occurrence of earthquakes in the world .", "questions": "The passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["an earthquake", "an earthquake ' s strength", "a usual natural disaster", "the reasons why earthquakes happen"], "human": ["scientists who study earthquakes", "the way of measuring earthquakes", "what people should do in the earthquake", "a usual natural disaster"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
