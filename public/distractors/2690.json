Psychologists classify envy in two ways : negative and positive . With positive envy , you are motivated by another person ' s success and struggle to follow it . With negative envy , you want to cut the advantaged person down so you look better by comparison . Let ' s say you feel sufferings of envy after your rival at another firm gets promoted . Negative envy might drive you to destroy his success , but positive envy would inspire you to work harder and get promoted , too . Studies show positive envy can be a great motivator . In a 2011 study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , researchers in the Netherlands conducted a series of experiments with more than 200 university students . Researchers found that when they caused feelings of positive envy - - - - as opposed to admiration or negative envy - - - - in the students , it drove them to want to study more and perform better on a test measuring creativity and intelligence . While admiration may feel better , the researchers found , it does n ' t motivate performance like the pain and frustration of envy . \" Those painful sufferings of envy are there for an evolutionary reason , \" says Texas Christian University researcher Sarah E . Hill , \" warning us that someone has something of importance to us . \" Building on this theory , Dr . Hill and others conducted a series of experiments , published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , to test whether envy improves attention and memory - - - - the tools needed to copy a rival ' s steps to success . In one experiment , half of the participants were asked to recall past feelings of envy ; the other half were n ' t . The two groups were then shown mock interviews of imaginary peers . The group filled with envy paid closer attention and better recalled details about the interview subjects . In other words , envy made them more astute . Not only can envy motivate us to reach for higher goals , it may even give us the cognitive push to get there .", "questions": "What is the main idea of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["do n ' t be influenced by negative discrimination .", "do n ' t be addicted to pain .", "make full use of positive envy .", "do n ' t be satisfied with negative influence ."], "human": ["Envy seems to be bad .", "Keep your envy in secret .", "Forget about your envy now .", "Make full use of positive envy ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
