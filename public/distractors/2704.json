{"id": "2704", "article": "Elizabeth Blackwell was born in England in 1821 , and moved to New York City when she was ten years old . One day she decided that she wanted to become a doctor . That was nearly impossible for a woman in the middle of the nineteenth century . After writing many letters asking for admission to medical schools , she was finally accepted by a doctor in Philadelphia . She was so determined that she taught school and gave music lessons to get money for the cost of schooling . In 1849 , after graduation from medical school , she decided to further her education in Paris . She wanted to be a surgeon , but a serious eye problem forced her to give up the idea . Upon returning to the United States , she found it difficult to start her own practice because she was a woman . By 1857 Elizabeth and her sister , also a doctor , along with another woman doctor , managed to open a new hospital , the first for women and children . Besides being the first woman physician and founding her own hospital , she also set up the first medical school for women .", "questions": "Why could n ' t Elizabeth Blackwell realize her dream of becoming a surgeon ?", "options": {"model": ["she wanted to be a doctor", "a serious eye problem stopped her", "she wanted to be a doctor in the 19th century"], "human": ["She could n ' t get admitted to medical school", "It was difficult for her to start a practice in the United States", "A serious eye problem stopped her"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
