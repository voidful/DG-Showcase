{"id": "1167", "article": "For 75 years , three words have influenced the lives of many young Brits . They are : mirror , signal , manoeuvre . These are the processes all drivers should perform . Learners hoping to pass their driving test need to prove that they understand the importance of these actions before they can throw out their L - plates and head for the highway . In Britain , L - plates ale signs with a red \" L \" on them which you attach to a car to warm other drivers that you are a learner . This summer the British driving test celebrates its seventy - fifth birthday . It ' s often described as one of the most frightening tests we face . It is a painful experience that does n ' t come very cheap nowadays . Taking the test in 1935 cost just 37 . 5 pence ; now candidates can expect to pay PS93 . The test is also harder than ever . In 1935 , the pass rate was 63 % ; now it ' s 43 % . In recent years , the DSA - - the organization that oversees the driving test - - has looked for ways to assess different aspects of what makes a good driver Now the DSA has announced that candidates will drive for ten minutes without detailed instructions from the examiner . DSA ' S chief driving examiner Trevor Wedge said the aim was to measure a candidate ' s ability to drive safely while making decisions independently . However , drivers will not be punished for getting lost . \" Candidates wo n ' t be failed for going off route , \" Mr . Wedge said . No doubt there will still be complaints . The BBC has learnt that in 2009 there were l , 889 complaints about examiners , of which just 51 were supported . Complaints that were rejected included ' ' Candidate crashed during test - - claims examiner distracted \" and \" Candidate says examiner took her on busy roads during rush hour , which was unfair \" . Someone else seemingly failed to understand the nature of an emergency stop when the complaint was filed that an emergency stop was conducted without warning .", "questions": "What does the author want to tell us most ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s not easy to get a driving license in britain .", "it ' s unnecessary to pay ps93 in britain .", "it ' s unnecessary to pay ps93 for the driving test .", "it ' s unnecessary to drive in britain ."], "human": ["People are afraid of taking tests .", "People must be careful while driving in Britain .", "Complaints about the DSA examiners are increasing .", "It ' s not easy to get a driving license in Britain ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
