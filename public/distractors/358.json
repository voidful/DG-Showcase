{"id": "358", "article": "Hello , Listeners . Welcome to Henton Hospital Radio . Before our music programme at four , I ' m going to repeat some of our hospital rules . The hospital can sleep 800 patients . There ' re 8 beds in each ward . The visiting hours are in the afternoon from 2 : 30 to 3 : 30 and in the evening from 7 : 00 to 8 : 00 . But remember only two people can see you at the same time . Sorry about that , but you can see what would happen if we did n ' t have these rules . The other rules are about our hours . We start quite early - - - you might not be used to that . We wake you at 6 o ' clock , and breakfast is at 8 o ' clock , lunch is at noon . There ' s tea at 3 : 30 and supper is at 6 o ' clock . You can see the non - smoking sign - - - we do n ' t allow smoking in the wards . I ' m sure you understand why . However , if you do need to smoke , there are some smoking rooms where it is allowed . You will find the radio switch on the wall near your bed , with your own headphones , if you want to listen . It ' s our own hospital radio wishing you a quick recovery .", "questions": "Which is Not allowed in the hospital ?", "options": {"model": ["visiting patients in the morning .", "going to hospital in the afternoon .", "smoking in the rooms in the hospital ."], "human": ["Listening to the hospital radio .", "Smoking in smoking - rooms .", "Visiting patients in the morning ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
