{"id": "5263", "article": "After years of study , I have known there are only two types of people in this world : those who get to the airport early and those who arrive when the plane is about to take off . If there were any justice in this world , early - airport people would be rewarded for doing the right thing . And late - airport people would be punished . But early - airport people getulcers , heart attacks and bite their fingernails to the bone . Late - airport people almost do n ' t realize they are flying . A guy of that kind once said , \" Do n ' t hurry . If you miss your flight , it ' s because God does n ' t want you to go . \" This is clearly a guy who is never going to get an ulcer . Early - airport people suffer another \" name \" . They are called exactly what they are - wimps . I know . I was an early - airport person for years . \" My baggage will get on the plane first , \" I told myself . Indeed it would , which made it the last baggage they took off the plane after landing . Another strange thing : No matter how early I showed up , I was always told that someone had called two or three years ahead of me and asked for the best seat . I thought it was a trick . I thought there was someone in America who called every airline every day and said : \" Is that wimp Simon flying somewhere today ? If he is , give me his seat . \" After a lifetime arguing with my wife over whether I really have to pack 24 hours in advance and set the alarm clock four hours ahead , I have learned another fact about early - airport people and late - airport people : They always marry each other .", "questions": "It could be inferred that the writer ' s wife is", "options": {"model": ["a late - airport woman", "a early - airport person"], "human": ["an early - airport woman", "a late - airport woman"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
