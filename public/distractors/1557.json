{"id": "1557", "article": "I had been to several doctors as a child , but I have a special place in my heart for Dr . Vincent . He was a Pediatric Cardiologist at UCLA back in 1971 who saved my life . I was eight years old at the time with a severe heart problem and I needed heart surgery . My Mom did not have the money , and without the surgery there was a real good chance I would not live to be thirteen years old . After contacting several organizations Dr . Vincent was able to get financial help for me through United Way , a Crippled Children ' s Organization . Dr . Vincent was a handsome man ; he was also very gentle and caring . I remember being in the hospital for an Angiogram test , and during the procedure I was crying terribly , so the medical staff called in Dr . Vincent to calm me down , and he was able to comfort me when no one else could . Then the time came for me to have heart surgery ; there was a fifty - percent chance that I would not make it through the surgery because it was experimental . At the time I was only the second or third person to have this procedure done . I was absolutely terrified , and again Dr . Vincent reassured me he would see to it that everything would be all right . I had a lot of confidence and trust in Dr . Vincent ; He came to see me after the surgery , which was extremely painful but very successful , and brought me a stuffed animal . I was so surprised to get this gift from Dr . Vincent ; I gave him a hug . I guess Dr . Vincent must have known I was feeling very lonely and scared . You see , I had no family or friends visit me while I was in the hospital except for my Mom , and I am not sure why . I do know one thing ; I had a wonderful doctor who took the time to help a scared little girl who felt all alone . This was twenty eight years ago , so wherever you are Dr . Vincent , I want to thank you for not only saving my life , but you helped me live a normal productive life , and for showing me that you truly cared , for that I will be eternally grateful to you .", "questions": "Dr .
