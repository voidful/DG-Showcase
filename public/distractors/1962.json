{"id": "1962", "article": "The Mississippi is the major river system in the United States . The Yangtze is China ' s longest river . Although a world apart , the two waterways share conservation concerns that provide a cultural bridge between students in the United States and China , as well as from around the world . The Mississippi flows almost 3 , 800 kilometers from a small lake in Minnesota , gathering the waters of 250 other rivers and streams before reaching the Gulf of Mexico . In mid - May , as spring flowers began to open , about 41 students from a dozen colleges , mostly in the Midwest , explored a section of the river in Wisconsin and Iowa , to learn about the environment , and each other . The students , from the U . S . , China and around the world , came to join the River Spirit Exchange program . The cross - cultural educational experience - set up by the University of Wisconsin , Madison - based Environment and Public Health Network for Chinese Students - focuses on the Mississippi and China ' s longest river , the Yangtze . This three day get - together featured story - telling , hiking , camping and canoeing , all part of a larger lesson about conservation projects that can be used on both the Yangtze and Mississippi . While the students learned about the problems challenging the Mississippi and Yangtze , Jeb Barzen , a wildlife biologist , explained they should also learn about the importance of bridging each other ' s culture . The president of the Environment and Public Health Network for Chinese Students , Xiaojun Lu , said the Mississippi and Yangtze Rivers are uniting these students from opposite ends of the earth . Organizers say the success and spirit of this first gathering of students will lead to other trips , including one down the Yangtze .", "questions": "According to the passage , the get - together", "options": {"model": ["took place in china ' s longest river", "took place in may"], "human": ["was organized by students", "took place in May"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
