{"id": "3727", "article": "Outside our hotel in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam , a seemingly ancient woman waited beside the door with her hand outstretched . Every day I put my hand in hers as our eyes met . She never failed to return my smile , my grasp , and my greeting . On the last day of our visit , I found myself alone on a busy corner across the street from our hotel . Bicycles and motorbikes rushed in front of me . As I hesitated on the sidewalk , I felt a hand on my elbow and looked down to see the smile of my small beggar friend looking up at me . She nodded her head toward the street , indicating that she would take me across . Together , we moved slowly into the chaos . Then we moved on toward the sidewalk , where she pulled my face down to hers , kissed me on both cheeks , and then left , still smiling and waving back to me . Traveling in poorer nations , I have witnessed a variety of ways to deal with beggars . The most common response of tourists faced with the poverty - stricken is to ignore them and focus their eyes elsewhere . I have seen people push away an outstretched hand in angry annoyance . A few may drop a few coins into the hand in a hurry , hoping that other ragged pursuers wo n ' t immediately appear on the scene . For many reasons , giving money is not the best response to an outstretched hand . Many world travelers have discovered that the greatest gift they can give is their time and respect . Everyone needs recognition , to be seen as worthy of being known , to feel appreciated and loved . And I believe that everyone is worthy and worth knowing .", "questions": "In common cases , people will do the following things to the beggars EXCEPT for", "options": {"model": ["giving them a gift", "greeting them normally"], "human": ["handing out some money", "greeting them normally"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
