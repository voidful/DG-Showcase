{"id": "4009", "article": "This happened several years ago . But it has stuck with me so I wanted to share it . Every day on my way to work I would buy a newspaper from an elderly gentleman on the corner of the street . He would always smile and say , \" Good morning . \" His smile always made my day . Most of the people who sell these papers are homeless or poor and they do it to make a few bucks . One day Charlie was n ' t there ! Someone else was in his place ! This other guy told me Charlie was in the veterans ' hospital . It troubled me all day long . All I could think about was Charlie being alone in the hospital . I never knew he was a veteran who had served our country . I just knew his smile always made my day . I asked my girlfriend if she would go with me to visit him and she agreed . When I showed up in Charlie ' s room he began to cry . He told us he had been feeling very lonely and was convinced no one would ever visit him . He said that we were his only visitors . We told him we were glad to do it and thanked him for all that he had done for others . I never saw Charlie after that , although I heard he moved to California . That was thirty years ago but I have n ' t forgotten my smiling friend . A big thankyou to those who serve our country and protect us and thank you Charlie , wherever you are !", "questions": "By saying \" his smile always made my day \" , the writer meant \"", "options": {"model": ["he smile always made my day", "he could n ' t go out to visit charlie", "his smile made me feel very happy", "his smile made the writer feel lonely"], "human": ["I always remembered his smile all day", "he always smiled as I made my way to work", "he would smile to wish me a good day", "his smile made me feel very happy"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
