As winter comes , days become shorter while the nights become longer , In the past people slept more in winter , but in modern times we just use more electric light instead of sunlight to continue our normal routines . But scientific research is finding that manhandling of electric light is making us sick . Electric light is fooling the body ' s biological clock into releasing awaking hormones ( ) at the wrong times , scientists say . This might be leading to seasonal fatigue and depression . Much more than mental health is at stake , Recent scientific studies have found that women who work at night , have higher chances of getting breast - cancer . \" Electric lights are wonderful , but as with a lot of other things , we really mess , things up \" said David Avery , a psychiatrist . \" Our ancestors evolved in a very regular light - dark cycle , and our bodies just work better that way . \" Researchers have known for a long time that all living things have a biological clock that is linked to light , Being of the natural day - night cycle can cause fatigue , mood change and depression , This is known as seasonal affective disorder , or SAD . Scientists disagree on the cause of SAD , Some say it is caused by winter ' s late sunrises , others blame the early sunsets . However , they all agree the perfect solution to SAD is to give up artificial light , It will quickly bring someone into a cycle of long , restful nights and easy awakenings at dawn . But realistically most people need to use electric light in their everyday life . Ironically the next best solution is to use more bright lights to reset the body ' s biological clock . By getting bright light first thing in the morning it simulates an earlier dawn and shifts the body clock forward , according to Alfred Lewy , a psychiatrist at Oregon Health & Science University . A 2005 study done by the American Psychiatric Association showed that daily exposure to bright light was about as effective as medicine used to treat several forms of depression .", "questions": "According to the text , electric light is bad for health mainly because", "options": {"model": ["it stimulates the body to release awaking hormones at the wrong time", "it makes the body unable to absorb light at night", "it prevents the body ' s biological clock from receiving light from it"], "human": ["is shortens people ' s sleeping time", "it releases radiation and increases people ' s chances of getting sick", "it stimulates the body to release awaking hormones at the wrong time"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
