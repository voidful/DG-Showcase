{"id": "716", "article": "Children who are spanked have lower IQs worldwide , including in the United States . All parents want smart children . Avoiding spanking and correcting misbehavior in other ways can help that happen . A new research by Professor Murray Straus found that children in the United States who were spanked had lower IQs four years later than those who were n ' t spanked . Straus and Mallie Paschall , a senior research scientist , studied nationally examples of 806 children aged 2 to 4 , and 704 aged 5 to 9 . Both groups were retested four years later . The IQs of children IQs aged 2 to 4 who were n ' t spanked were 5 points higher four year later than the IQs of those who were spanked . The IQs of children aged 5 to 9 who were n ' t spanked were 2 . 8 points higher four years later than the IQs of children at the same age who were spanked . How often parents spanked made a difference . The more spanking , the slower the development of children ' s mental ability . But even small amounts of spanking made a difference . Straus also found a lower national average IQ in nations in which spanking was more popular . His analysis shows the strongest link between physical punishment and IQ is for those whose parents continue to use physical punishment even when they are teenagers . Straus also found a lower national average IQ in nations in which spanking was more popular . His analysis shows the strongest link between physical punishment and IQ is for those whose parents continue to use physical punishment even when they are teenagers . Straus and colleagues in 32 nations used data on physical punishment experienced by 17 , 404 university students when they were children . According to Straus , there ' re two explanations for the relation of physical punishment to lower IQ . First , physical punishment is extremely stressful and can become a long - lasting stressor for young children , who typically experience punishment three or more times a week . For many it continues for years . The stress of physical punishment often leads to being fearful that terrible things are about to happen and being easily shocked . They ' re associated with lower IQ . Second , a higher national level of economic development leads to both fewer parents using physical punishment and a higher", "questions": "From the passage we can know that physical punishment will make", "options": {"model": ["a child feel nervous continuously", "a child more likely to be easily hurt by a serious stress", "a child ' s iq"], "human": ["a well - behaved child", "a bad parent - child relationship", "a child feel nervous continuously"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
