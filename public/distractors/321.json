{"id": "321", "article": "People should listen to music for no more than one hour a day to protect their hearing , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) suggests . It says 1 . 1 billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of permanently damaging their hearing by listening to \" too much , too loudly \" . It said audio devices , concerts and bars were causing a \" serious threat \" . WHO figures show 43 million people aged 12 - 35 have hearing loss and the number is increasing . In that age group , the WHO said , half of the people in rich and middle - income countries were exposed to unsafe sound levels from personal audio devices . Meanwhile 40 % were exposed to damaging levels of sound from clubs and bars . The proportion of US teenagers with hearing loss went from 3 . 5 % in 1994 to 5 . 3 % in 2006 . \" What we ' re trying to do is raise awareness of the problem that is not talked about enough , but has the potential to do a lot of damage that can be easily prevented , \" said Dr Etienne Krug , the WHO ' s director for injury prevention . The full report argued : \" While it is important to keep the volume down , limiting the use of personal audio devices to less than one hour a day would do much to reduce noise exposure . \" Dr Krug said : \" That ' s a rough recommendation , it is not by the minute , to give an idea to those spending 10 hours a day listening to an mp3 - player . But even an hour can be too much if the volume is too loud . \"", "questions": "What might be the main cause of hearing loss according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["listening to too much and too loud music .", "listening to a lot of music .", "listening to too much music ."], "human": ["Listening to music at concerts .", "Listening to music from poor audio devices .", "Listening to too much and too loud music ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
