The idea that you might want to walk down the street holding a mobile phone in front of your face , just to experience the wonders of video calling , is clearly ridiculous . Luckily for the tech companies , however , there are some people who jump at the chance to buy into new gadgets before they are fully ready and cheap enough for the mass - market . They are called early adopters , and their fate is a terrible one . I should know , since I am one myself . Early adopters have a Mecca : it ' s Tokyo ' s Akihabara district , also known as \" Electric City \" . There , in 1999 , I bought a digital camera , a gizmo that few people in Britain had heard of . Over the next few years I watched in great sadness as digital cameras became more popular , cheaper and more powerful , until better models could be had for a quarter of the price I had paid . Did I feel stupid ? What I actually did was this : I splashed out more money last year for a new one , one that let me feel pleasantly ahead of the curve once again . But I know that can not last , and I ' ll probably have to buy another in a few years . Thus early adopters are betting on other people eventually feeling the same desires . And it ' s worse if that future never arrives . Early adopters of the Betamax home - video format in the 1970s could only look on in sadness when their investment was nullified by the success of VHS . All sorts of apparently splendid inventions , such as videogame consoles like the Atari Jaguar have been abandoned to the dustbin of history right after a few early adopters bought in . Those who invested thousands in a Segway motorized scooter on the wave of ridiculous advertising campaigns that accompanied its launch a couple of years ago can join the club . You might think we should just stop being so silly , save our money , and wait to see what really catches on .
