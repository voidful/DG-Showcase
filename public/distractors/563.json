{"id": "563", "article": "The average college student in America spent an estimated seven hundred dollars on textbooks last year . The National Association of College Stores reported more than five billion dollars in sales of textbooks and course materials . Association spokesman Charles Schmidt says electronic textbooks now represent just two to three percent of sales . But he says that is expected to reach ten to fifteen percent by 2012 . Online versions are now available for many of the most popular college textbooks . E - textbooks can cost half the price of a new print textbook . But students usually lose access after the end of the term . And the books can not be placed on more than one device so they are not easy to share . So what do students think of e - textbooks ? Administrators at Northwest Missouri State University wanted to find out . Earlier this year they tested them with five hundred students in twenty classes . The university is unusual . It not only provides laptop computers to all seven thousand of its full - time students . It does not require students to buy their textbooks either . They rent them to save money . The school aims to save even more by moving to e - textbooks . The students in the survey reported that downloading the books from the Internet was easy . They liked the idea of carrying lighter backpacks . And fifty - six percent said they were better able to find information . But most found that using e - textbooks did not change their study habits . And sixty percent felt they read more when they were reading on paper . In all , almost half the students said they still liked physical textbooks better . But the survey found that cost could be a big influence . Fifty - five percent said they would choose e - textbooks if using them meant their textbook rental fee would not increase . Roger Von Holzen heads the Center for Information Technology in Education at Northwest Missouri State . He tells us that administrators are disappointed with the e - textbooks now available because the majority are not interactive . He thinks growth will come when more digital books include video , activities , games and other ways to interact with the information . The technology is improving . But for now , most of the books are just words on a screen .", "questions": "It can be inferred from the passage that e - textbooks", "options": {"model": ["can not be found in the us", "still have a lot to improve"], "human": ["will replace physical textbooks", "still have a lot to improve"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
