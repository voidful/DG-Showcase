Arjun is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in the United States . He says the disaster in Japan is historic . This week , the chairman of America ' s nuclear agency said there is little chance that harmful radiation from Japan could reach the United States .

Nuclear energy is a clean resource , producing no carbon gases . But radioactive waste is a serious problem to be solved . So is the presence of nuclear power centers in earthquake areas like the one near Bushehr , lran .", "questions": "We can learn from the text that America", "options": {"model": ["did n ' t have a nuclear power center until year ago", "experienced a terrible nuclear accident 32 years ago"], "human": ["depends heavily on nuclear energy to produce electricity", "experienced a terrible nuclear accident 32 years ago"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
