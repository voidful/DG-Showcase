{"id": "1070", "article": "Is there a limit to the number of years that a person can expect to live ? Can changes in life - style add years to one ' s life ? Throughout history people have sought answers to these questions and others . Various myths offer the hope of great longevity . In the imaginary land of Shangri - La , for example , people are said to lead a charmed existence for a thousand years . The Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon was convinced that he would find the Foundation of Youth in what is now the state of Florida . According to the Bible , Methuselah lived to be more than 900 years old . The subject of longevity is fascinating , and scientists study individuals such as Jeanne Calment to learn about the aging process . Calment died in 1997 in Arles , France , at the age of 122 . She never married , and she lived in her own apartment until moving to a retirement community when she was 109 . Most scientists agree that bodies will last , at best , about 125 years . This potential has changed little since modern human beings appeared more than 100 thousand years age . Recent improvements in medicine and the environment have extended life expectancy , especially for those from poorer parts of the world . It is not clear , however , whether such improvements will lengthen life expectancy beyond a certain point . Life expectancy is the number of years an infant can be expected to live , given the conditions into which it is born . Life expectancy , therefore , is affected by nutrition , medical care , and social and political circumstances . An individual ' s genetic makeup is also an important factor . Children from long - lived families can hope to enjoy long lives themselves . According to recent data , the average life expectancy worldwide in 1998 was 67 years . This can be compared with an average life expectancy of 77 in the United States . In 1970 the average life expectancy worldwide was 61 years , or 6 years less than it was in 1998 . This same period saw a drop in infant mortality - - - the death of a child before the first birthday - - - from 80 births out of 1 , 000 to 54 births out of 1 , 000 . According to some researchers , the rise in the average life expectancy is due primarily to the drop in infant mortality . It is not so much that adults are living to an older age . It is , rather , that more people are", "questions": "Infant mortality is defined as", "options": {"model": ["the number of children , out of 1 , 000 births , who die before their first birthday", "the number of children who"], "human": ["the number of children born alive", "the number of children , out of 1 , 000 births , who die before their first birthday"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
