Before the men ever had a proper conversation , they had a serious physical fight . Peter hit Will over the head with a heavy pot , and then they both rolled down the stairs of Will ' s North London home before Peter hit him again with a pot . Will was knocked out and bleeding from the back of the head , but he refused to give in to Peter - a desperate heroin addict with a 30 - year habit who had broken into Will ' s home to steal whatever valuables he could then sell to buy drugs . It was 5 p . m . on March 2002 , when Peter forced the front door of Will ' s five - storey Georgian home in Islington . And when Will walked into his bedroom to get something , he was shocked to find an unpleasant - smelling man in front of him . \" I asked him what he was doing in my house , and he said he was a neighbor who had heard a noise and was worried , \" says Will . \" I was sure he was a thief , so as he went past me , I grabbed him and pushed him to the floor . \" I managed to get him downstairs and out into the street after pulling his jacket down to trap his arms . I was shouting , ' Thief ! Thief ! ' Someone had heard me shouting and called the police , who arrived within minutes . \" The police put Peter into the back of their police car . He soon began a three - year sentence in London ' s Pentonville Prison on a charge of breaking and entering .

Will met Peter again . He says , \" I thought I might be able to help him change _ . \" Will saved Peter ' s life . \" We ' re great friends , we get on extremely well , and", "questions": "It can be learned from the text that Peter and Will", "options": {"model": ["became good friends after a fight", "were n ' t good friends with each other", "were n ' t ten years old"], "human": ["met for the first time in prison", "refuse to talk about anything when they meet", "became good friends after a fight"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
