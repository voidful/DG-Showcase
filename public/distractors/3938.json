{"id": "3938", "article": "Ray ' s wedding had gone off smoothly . Everyone seemed to have had a good time . A few people had too good a time ; they went home with designated drivers . All evening , the gift table remained unguarded . Who would steal anything , Ray thought . He had never heard of such a thing happening at a wedding . But his best friend Aaron said there was a first time for everything . He walked out regularly from the inside festivities to check on the gift table , making sure no one doubtful was hanging around it . Ray and Julia went on a 3 - week honeymoon to Italy right after the wedding . When they got back , they opened all the gifts and sent out thank - you notes . But there was one problem . A married couple that used to be good friends had obviously given nothing . This surprised Julia , because Walt and Mary said they were excited to be invited . And , they actually seemed to have had a great time at the wedding . Frankly , Ray did n ' t even care if they had n ' t given a gift . He just needed to know whether to send a thank - you note . Ray called Aaron . Aaron said maybe Walt had left an envelope on the gift table like Aaron had . \" Yes , but we got your envelope with the cash inside , \" Ray said . \" Maybe my envelope looked too thin , and some thief thought Walt ' s envelope looked nice and fat . \" Aaron asked Ray if he had looked everywhere for Walt ' s gift . Had he called up the wedding site to see if anything had been left behind ? Ray said that he had looked everywhere and made a lot of calls that were fruitless . Ray did n ' t know what to do . If he sent Walt and Mary a thank - you note for a gift they had n ' t given , they would be _ . If he did n ' t send them a thank - you note for a gift they had given , they would get angry . \" What would you do ? \" Ray asked . Aaron said he would call Walt up and tell him the problem . \" You ca n ' t go wrong with simply being honest , \" Aaron said . \" Oh , yes , you can , \" Ray contradicted him . \" Sometimes it ' s best to let sleeping dogs lie . \" But he thought about it , and finally decided that Aaron was right .", "questions": "Which of the following might be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["ray ' s comfortable comfortable comfortable co", "the special gift", "ray ' s love", "the wedding gift"], "human": ["A Wedding Party", "The Thief at the Wedding", "A Secret at the Wedding", "The Wedding Gift"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
