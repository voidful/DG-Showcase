{"id": "3695", "article": "Every year , a handful of new words enter the world ' s collective vocabulary , but only one has the honor of being named Oxford Dictionaries ' Word of the Year . And this year ' s top honor goes to \" selfie \" . The frequency of the word selfie used in the English language has increased by 17 , 000 per cent since this time last year . This figure is calculated by Oxford Dictionaries using a research program which collects around 150 million English words currently in use from around the web every month . To qualify , a word need not have been invented within the past 12 months but it does need to stand out or become notable at that time . Selfie is defined by Oxford Dictionaries as : \" A photograph that one has taken of oneself , typically one taken with a smart phone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website . \" Oxford Dictionaries said the earliest known usage is an Australian online forum post in 2002 . A man posted a picture of injuries to his face when he tripped over some steps . He apologized for the fact that the picture was out of focus , saying that it was not because he was drunk but because it was a selfie . Judy Pearsall , editorial director for Oxford Dictionaries , said : \" Using the Oxford Dictionaries language research program , we can see a phenomenal upward trend in the use of selfie in 2013 , and this helped to win its selection as Word of the Year . \" She also added : \" Social media sites helped to popularize the term , with selfie appearing on the photo - sharing website Flicker as early as 2004 , but usage was n ' t widespread until around 2012 , when selfie was being used commonly in mainstream media sources . \" Selfies have taken the world by storm . Everyone from the first family to ordinary people has taken the time to pose for a selfie . Celebrities like Miley Cyrus , Jennifer Lawrence , and Jennifer Aniston have all showed their new haircuts with selfies this year . Selfie was added to the Oxford Dictionaries online in August , but not yet in the Oxford English .", "questions": "What does this passage mainly talk about ?", "options": {"model": ["selfie has been used in the english language of oxford dictionaries .", "\" selfie \" has been used to be used in the us .", "\" selfie \" has been chosen as the word of the year of 2013 .", "selfie has been used in the english language for more than 12 weeks ."], "human": ["The definition of the word \" Selfie \" .", "The widespread usage of the word \" Selfie \" in 2012 .", "\" Selfie \" began to be used in the Oxford English .", "\" Selfie \" has been chosen as the Word of the Year of 2013 ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
