{"id": "3473", "article": "One day , around Christmas time , fishermen off the west coast of Peru started on their traditional fishing trip . Much to their surprise , there were no fish ! They knew immediately what had happened . Tales from years gone by had told them this was the result of El Nino which sometimes stop fishing for many months ! El Nino is a warm _ that comes and goes along the west coast of South America . It got its name from fishermen in Peru more than a century ago . Every few years , they noticed a sudden warming in the normally cool Pacific water where they fished . Because this warming often came about around Christmas , they called it El Nino , which is Spanish for the \" Christ Child \" . Generally , El Nino occurs every three to seven years and lasts only a few weeks to a month or more . El Nino warms the water it flows through . Because the fish and sea birds need cold water to live , many of them die when El Nino comes through . El Nino also causes both floods and droughts . It is believed that El Nino may have caused the 1993 Mississippi and 1995 California floods . And at the same time , it may have caused droughts in South America , Africa and Australia . El Nino has occurred thirteen times within the last fifty years , bringing natural disasters to many countries such as Indonesia and Peru . However , El Nino does not often trouble China . During this period China was badly hit by El Nino only once . In 1998 , North China had a terrible drought , while South China was troubled by floods .", "questions": "If El Nino happens , the following will take place EXCEPT", "options": {"model": ["diseases spreading around the world", "people fishing on el nino frequently", "the death of many people in the world"], "human": ["floods and droughts", "death of fish and sea birds", "diseases spreading around the world"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
