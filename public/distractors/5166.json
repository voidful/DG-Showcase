{"id": "5166", "article": "Plastic is one of the most important technological discoveries of the 20th century . However , it may soon be replaced . The new development - liquid wood - can replace plastics in all branches of modern - day industries . Plastic as a material enjoys the biggest demand in the modern world , but it does have a number of drawbacks . First and foremost , plastic is n ' t recyclable . Secondly , it contains toxins helping develop cancerous diseases . Finally , it ' s made of oil and oil reserves are n ' t endless . The liquid wood technology is likely to replace plastic and providing mankind with new materials for many years ahead . Norbert Eisenfreich , a senior researcher at the Faunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology in Germany ( ICT ) , said that arboform , the new material , is made of lignin , which can be obtained from soft tissues of wood . Once mixed with several other matenals , it turns into solid and non - toxic _ for plastics . ICT team leader Emilia Regina Inone - Kauffmann said the wood - working industry separates wood into three basic components , including lignin . Lignin is n ' t used for the production of paper . Specialists of ICT mixed lignin with several natural materials and thus invented the material which could be melted and molded . When solid , arboform looks like plastic and possesses tho qualitie of polished wood . It can be used for the production of any items . Arboform is already used for the production of car parts which require extra strength . In addition , liquid wood can be recycled repeatedly . The material preserved all of its qualities even if it ' s reprocessed ten times . However , the new invention does n ' t enjoy an extensive use due to the high content of sulfur in it . German researchers are sure to reduce the amount of sulfur by 90 % very soon to make arboform usable for home needs .", "questions": "It can be concluded that German researchers will focus their future work firstly on", "options": {"model": ["arboform made of wood", "the development of arboform for home needs", "the content of sulfur in arboform", "the development of arboform"], "human": ["the material ' s extensive use", "the production cost of arboform", "the qualities of liquid wood", "the content of sulfur in arboform"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
