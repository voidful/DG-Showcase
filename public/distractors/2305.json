{"id": "2305", "article": "A powerful earthquake struck the northeastern coast of Japan at 2 : 46 p . m . local time on March 11th . Japan ' s Meteorological Agency released its first tsunami warnings just three minutes later . The country has one of the best earthquake early warning systems in the world . More than 4 , 000 Seismic Intensity Meters provide information within two minutes of an earthquake happening . There are also concrete sea walls around much of the Japanese coastline . But these measures proved no match for the powerful earthquake and tsunami . Costas Synolakis is a tsunami expert in the University of Southern California in Los Angeles . He says : \" Japan is one of those most well - prepared countries on earth in terms of tsunami warning . They had a warning . I think what went wrong is that they had not anticipated the size of this event . \" He says there are two reasons for this . First , scientists had not expected such a large earthquake . The 9 . 0 magnitude earthquake was the 4th most powerful earthquake ever recorded worldwide . It was also the worst ever to hit Japan . The tsunami waves reached as high as 13 meters in some areas . Second , Japan ' s concrete sea walls were not built to handle such high waves . \" In Sendai , they were about three meters . At least in that area they were not expecting such a sizeable wave because they would have built a higher seawall . \" A tsunami wave can travel as fast as 800 kilometers per hour . To get to higher ground people would often have to travel for many kilometers . This can take more time than a fast traveling tsunami will permit . This is especially true in cases like Japan . The tsunami waves followed almost immediately . Experts say early warning systems will continue to be limited by these facts until earthquakes and tsunamis can be predicted .", "questions": "According to Costas Synolakis ,", "options": {"model": ["the japanese were n ' t afraid of tsunami", "the earthquake was the worst earthquake ever to hit japan", "the tsunami waves did n ' t have any effect on this earthquake", "the japanese were not really prepared for such a disaster"], "human": ["Japan had a warning of such a serious earthquake", "Japan has experienced the worst earthquake worldwide", "the Japanese should have built higher seawalls", "The Japanese were not really prepared for such a disaster"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
