Tisich announced . - - You see , your mother has been offered a post as co - director of a television station in Chicago . Unfortunately , the station is not here . After thinking long and hard about it , we ' ve concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago . Marc looked shocked , while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they ' d be moving . - - It ' s surprising , but exciting ! she said . Marc simply said , - - We ca n ' t go - - I ca n ' t leave all my friends . I ' d rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons ! The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August , Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving . However , he showed no signs of accepting the news , refusing to pack his belongings . When the morning of the move arrived , Marc was nowhere to be found . His parents called Tommy Lyon ' s house , but Mrs . Lyons said she had n ' t seen Marc . Mrs . Tisich became increasingly concerned , while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly . What they did n ' t know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy ' s house , with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons ' s attic for a few days . But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood : the fence that he and his mother painted , the tree that he and his sister used to climb , and the park where he and his father often took evening walks together . How much would these mean without his family ? Who make them special in the first place ? Marc did n ' t take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house , wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection .", "questions": "What would most likely happen next ?", "options": {"model": ["mr . and mrs . tisich would leave the family .", "mr . and mrs . tisich would visit marc .", "mr . and mrs . tisich would leave the family for the hospital .", "marc would join his family for house moving ."], "human": ["Marc would bring his records over to the Lyons ' s house .", "Mr . and Mrs .
