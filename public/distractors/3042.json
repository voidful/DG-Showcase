{"id": "3042", "article": "The water level of oceans rises and falls alternately twice a day . This movement of water is called the tide . Tides are causer by the pull of the sun and the moon on the earth ' s surface ; since the moon is closer , it affects the tides more than the sun . When the moon is directly overhead , it actually pulls on the water that is below it . This causes the water level to rise because the water is pulled away from the earth . As the moon disappears over the horizon , the pull lessens and the water level settles back towards the ocean bottom . When the water reaches its highest level , we have high tide . And when the water comes to its lowest level , we have low tide from its lowest point , the water rises gradually for about six hours until it reaches high tide . Then it begins to fall continuously for about six hours until it reaches low tide . Then the cycle begins again .", "questions": "The pull of the moon on the earth ' s surface is stronger than that of the sun because", "options": {"model": ["the moon is closer to the earth", "the moon is greater than that of the sun", "the moon is greater", "the moon is bigger than the sun"], "human": ["The moon is directly over the earth", "The moon pulls the water away from the earth", "The moon moves around the earth", "The moon is closer to the earth"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
