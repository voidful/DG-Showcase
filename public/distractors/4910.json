{"id": "4910", "article": "We send our children to school to prepare them for the time when they will be big and will have to work for themselves . They learn their own language so that they will be able to tell others clearly what they want and what they know , and understand what others tell them . They learn foreign languages in order to be able to understand the people from other countries and make themselves understood . They learn history to know something about human beings they meet every day . What they learn at school is , of course , quite useful , but is that the only reason why they go to school ? No . There is more in education than just learning facts . We go to school , above all , to learn how to learn , so that when we have left school , we can continue to learn . A man who really knows how to learn will always be successful , because whenever he has to do something new , he will quickly teach himself how to do it in the best way . The uneducated person , on the other hand , is either unable to do something new , or does it badly . So the purpose of school is not just to teach the students these useful subjects but teach the way to learn .", "questions": "The main idea of the text is that", "options": {"model": ["children should be taught not only to learn but how to learn", "children should be taught to learn", "students should learn how to learn", "students can learn more than before"], "human": ["children must go to school", "the subjects at school are useful", "parents should send their children to school", "children should be taught not only to learn but how to learn"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
