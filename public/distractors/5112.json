{"id": "5112", "article": "I arrived in the UK last weekend to learn English . So far I have already made a few friends and had some traditional English food there . But after having three days of hamburgers , sandwiches and potatoes , I thought none could be more delicious than Chinese food , especially my favorite - - huo guo . You ca n ' t imagine how excited I was when I got to know that there was going to be a free meal of hotpot to welcome the new students . On the way to the canteen , I seemed to smell huo guo in the air . To my surprise , when I stepped into the room , I did n ' t see any sign of huo guo . Where was it ? With many questions in my head , I sat down to have the free meal . After talking with an English girl , I got to know that Chinese huo guo is completely different from hotpot . Chinese huo guo is written in two words - hot pot ; and hotpot , one word , is a traditional English dish . Hotpot is made from mutton and onion . On the top are pieces of potatoes . People put it in the oven all day in a heavy pot on a low heat . It takes very little effort to prepare . You can often see it at parties in the UK because it ' s easy to prepare for a large number of people and is not expensive . Hotpot does n ' t taste bad . However , I still miss huo guo - hot pot , two words !", "questions": "After the free meal , the writer learnt that", "options": {"model": ["there was no chinese huo guo - hot pot", "\" hotpot \" was n ' t \" hot pot \"", "english food is the same as chinese food", "\" hotpot \" is n ' t a traditional chinese dish"], "human": ["hotpot took little time to cook", "hotpot was n ' t traditional in the UK", "the English girl knew little about hotpot", "\" hotpot \" was n ' t \" hot pot \""]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
