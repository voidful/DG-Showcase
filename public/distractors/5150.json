{"id": "5150", "article": "IT ' S a mystery that has puzzled scientists . Five years ago , researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed , where a part of the Earth ' s outer layer , or crust , is missing . A thick layer of dark green rock , which is usually found deep inside the planet , lies exposed . The crust , mantle and core are the main layers that make up the planet . The mantle rests between the crust and the core . Last month , a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six - week trip to study the hole in the crust . The hole is about 4 , 800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48 , 000 meters long and more than 48 , 000 meters wide . Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps . \" It is like a window into the interior of the Earth , \" says scientist Bramley Murton , who is part of the research team . The site where the hole is located is part of a ridge of undersea volcanoes . There , two of the plates that make up the Earth ' s surface meet . The plates are always moving . When the plates move away from each other , lava rushes up from the mantle to fill the gap and form a new crust . But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located . The hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what ' s below the Earth ' s surface . The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle . They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth ' s surface behaves under the sea .", "questions": "How does the hole come into being ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s not the same as the earth ' s surface .", "the hole is about 4 , 800 meters below sea level .", "it ' s not clear from the passage ."], "human": ["It ' s because of the plates movements", "It ' s because lava rushes up from the mantle", "It ' s not clear from the passage ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
