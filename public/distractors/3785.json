{"id": "3785", "article": "Redwood trees are the tallest plants on the earth , reaching heights of up to 100 meters . They are also known for their longevity , typically 500 to 1000 years , but sometimes more than 2000 years . A hundred million years ago , in the age of dinosaurs , redwoods were common in the forests of a much more moist and tropical North America . As the climate became drier and colder , they declined to a narrow strip along the Pacific coast of Northern Califomia . The trunk of redwood trees is very strong and usually forms a single straight column . It is covered with a soft bark . This bark can be pretty thick , well over two feet in the more mature trees . It gives the older trees a certain kind of protection from insects , but the main benefit is that it keeps the center of the tree harmless from moderate forest fires because of its thickness . This fire resistant quality explains why the giant redwood grows to live that long . While most other types of trees are destroyed by forest fires , the giant redwood actually prospers because of them . Moderate fires will clear the ground of competing plant life , and the rising heat dries and opens the ripe fruit of the redwood , releasing many thousands of seeds onto the ground below . New trees are often produced from shoots , little baby trees , which form at the base of the trunk . These shoots grow slowly , fed by the root system of the \" mother ' ' tree . When the main tree dies , the shoots are then free to grow as full trees , forming a \" fairy ring \" of trees around the original tree . These trees , in turn , may give rise to more shoots , and the cycle continues .", "questions": "Why were redwood trees easier to find in the forests of North America millions of years ago ?", "options": {"model": ["they were the largest plants on the earth .", "the climate there was warmer and wetter ."], "human": ["The trees were taller and stronger .", "The climate there was warmer and wetter ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
