But I was tired and it was so late that I had to come back . \" Tom cried . \" It does n ' t matter . You are only 14 years old after all . You will have another chance . \" his mother said . \" But , standing at the top of the mountain is my dream ! \" Tom said . His father came over and asked , \" Did you see the green trees on your way to the mountain ? \" \" Sure , and there are a lot of beautiful flowers by the side of the road . \" Tom replied . \" Did you hear the birds singing ? \" his father asked . \" There are many kinds of birds singing in the trees , and the sound was very sweet . \" Tom said . \" Did you feel the beauty of nature ? \" his father asked . \" Yes , the blue sky , the white clouds , the green trees and the colorful flowers made a nice picture . \" Tom answered . \" That ' s enough ! \" his father smiled and said , \" Please remember , son . For often , achieving what you expect is not the most important thing . Although you did n ' t reach the top of the mountain , you got a lot on the way . \" It is true that not every goal will be achieved , not every job will end up with a success , and not every dream will come true .
