People of different ages , from 12 to 83 , were asked to have a test . During the test , these people were given all kinds of breakfasts , and sometimes they got no breakfast at all . Scientists wanted to see how well their bodies worked when they had different kinds of breakfasts . The rules show that if a person eats a right breakfast , he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast . If a student has fruit , eggs , bread and milk before going to school , he or she will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class . The result is opposite to what some people think . Having no breakfast will not help them lose weight . This is because they are so hungry at noon that eat too much for lunch . They will gain weight instead of losing it . You will lose weight if you reduce your other meals .", "questions": "Scientists wanted to know whether", "options": {"model": ["students should have breakfast at school", "students should have no breakfast .", "a person should have no breakfast .", "breakfast had any effect on work and studies ."], "human": ["people were interested in breakfast", "breakfast did harm to people ' s health", "people would work better without breakfast", "breakfast had any effect on work and studies ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
