{"id": "5342", "article": "Egypt : Bridging the Gap between School English and Real English Teaching English in Egypt in general and in my town Damietta in particular , is mainly directed towards helping students to pass their final exams . Unfortunately , most teachers do not adopt a long - term approach that guarantees that their students will be able to use English outside the classroom . So students only concentrate on one skill which is writing . Thus their listening and speaking skills are disabled . What is important to them is to pass the exam which is primarily based on writing . Teachers are not only concentrated with providing their students with questions that are similar to those of the final exam , particularly General Secondary Education Certificate ( GSEC ) Examination , so students spend most of their time answering typical exam questions . Most students ' scores are high ; a lot of students get full marks . However , few students are able to communicate in English because their role plays . As a result , a lot of students complain that they are unable to understand and talk fluently with native speakers of English . To enable students to communicate freely and spontaneously in English , I bring features of real communication into language practice , I always ask students about their own experiences , and suggest groups of students practice what they have learned outside the classroom . This helps lower - achieving students absorb language . Furthermore , role play is a very effective way to improve speaking skills particularly if it is connected to the experience of the students .", "questions": "Who probably write this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["an english teacher", "a teacher"], "human": ["a student", "a teacher"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
