{"id": "5535", "article": "Home to me means a sense of familiarity and nostalgia . It ' s fun to come home . It looks the same . It smells the same . You ' ll realize what ' s changed is you . Home is where we ran remember pain , live , and some other experiences ; We parted here ; My parents met here ; I won three championships here . If I close my eyes , I can still have a clear picture in mind of my first home . I walk in the door and see a brown sofa surrounding a low glass - top wooden table . To the right of the living room is my first bedroom . It ' s empty , but it ' s where my earliest memories are . There is the dining room table where I celebrated birthdays , and where I cried on Halloween - when I did n ' t want to wear the skirt my mother made for me . I always liked standing on that table because it made me feel tall and strong . If I sit at this table , I can see my favorite room in the house , my parents ' room . It is simple : a brown wooden dresser lines the right side of the wall next to a television and a couple of photos of my grandparents on each side . Their bed is my safe zone . I can jump on it anytime - waking up my parents if I am scared or if I have an important announcement that can not wait until the morning . I ' m lucky because I know my first home still exists . It exists in my mind and heart , on a physical property on West 64th street on the western edge of Los Angeles . It is proof I lived , I grew and I learned . Sometimes when I feel lost , I lie down and shut my eyes , and I go home . I know it ' s where I ' ll find my family , my dogs , and my belongings . I purposely leave the window open at night because I know I ' ll be blamed by Mom . But I do n ' t mind , because I want to hear her say my name , which reminds me I ' m home .", "questions": "What can be learned from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the author can still visit her first physical home in los angeles .", "the author does n ' t like to wear her mother made her feel strong .", "the author ' s parents will have a happy home in los angeles ."], "human": ["The author ' s favorite room in her first home is the dining room .", "Many people of the author ' s age can still find their first physical homes .", "The author can still visit her first physical home in Los Angeles ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
