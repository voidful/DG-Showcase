On the way home we had to stop at traffic lights , and there my wife saw the bookshelf . It stood outside a furniture shop . \" Buy it , \" she said at once . \" We ' ll carry it home on the roof - rack . I ' ve always wanted one like that . \" What should I do ? Ten minutes later I was twenty dollars poorer , and the bookshelf was tied onto the roof - rack . It was tall and narrow , quite heavy too . As it was getting darker , I drove slowly . Other drivers seemed more polite than usual that evening . The police evenstopped teaffic to let us through . Carrying furniture was a good idea . After some time my wife said , \" There ' s a long line of cars behind . Why do n ' t they overtake \" Just at that time a police car did overtake . The two officers inside looked at us seriously when they went past . But then , with a kind smile they asked us to follow their car through the busy traffic . The police car stopped at our village church . One of the officers came to me . \" Right , sir ! \" he said , \" Do you need any more help now ? \" I did n ' t quite understand . \" Thanks , officer , \" I said . \" You ' ve been very kind . I live just down the road . \" He was looking at our things , first at the flowers , then at the bookshelf . \" Well , well , \" he said and laughed . \" It ' s a bookshelf you ' ve got there ! We thought it was . . . er . . . , something else . \" My wife began to laugh . Suddenly i understood why the police drove here . I smiled at the officer . \" Yes , it ' s a bookshelf , but thanks again . \" I drove home as fast as i could .", "questions": "What made the writer think that carrying furniture was \" a good idea \" ?", "options": {"model": ["other drivers would let him go first .", "the police would help him out of the car ."], "human": ["His wife could use a new bookshelf .", "Other drivers would let him go first ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
