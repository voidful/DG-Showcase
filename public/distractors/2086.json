{"id": "2086", "article": "Gone with the Wind is a novel written by Margaret Mitchell , first published in 1936 . It was popular with American readers from the onset and was the top American fiction bestseller in the year it was published and in 1937 on the row . As of 2014 , a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers , just behind the Bible . More than 30 million copies have been printed worldwide . The sales of Margaret Mitchell ' s novel in the summer of 1936 , at the virtually unprecedented price of three dollars , reached about one million by the end of December . Because it was released in the era of the Great Depression and Mitchell worried the high $ 3 . 00 price would ruin its chance for success . Actually the book was a bestseller by the time reviews began to appear in national magazines . Herschel Brickell , a critic for the New York Evening Post , praised Mitchell for the way she \" tosses out the window all the thousands of technical tricks our novelists have been playing with for the past twenty years . \" One criticism by literary scholar Patricia Yaeger , leveled at Gone with the Wind , is for its portrayal of African Americans in the 19th century South . Former field hands during the early days of Reconstruction are described behaving \" as creatures of small intelligence might naturally be expected to do . Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension , they ran wild ~ either from wrong pleasure in destruction or simply because of their ignorance . \" In Gone with the Wind Mitchell is blind to racial oppression and ' the inseparability of race and gender \" that defines the southern belle character of Scarlett , according to Patricia Yaeger . Yet there are complexities in the way that Mitchell dealt with racial issues . Scarlett was asked by a Yankee woman for advice on who to appoint as a nurse for her children ; Scarlett suggested a \" darky \" , much to the disgust of the Yankee woman who was seeking an Irish maid , a \" Bridget \" .
