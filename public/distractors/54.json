Authorities have removed more than 210 , 000 online posts and shut down 42 websites since mid - March in their latest crackdown on online rumors , said Liu Zhengrong , a senior official with the State Internet Information Office . Fake information or rumors spread through the Internet , especially on micro blogs , have harmed social order and residents ' daily lives , he said at a news briefing in Beijing . Before the crackdown , six people who allegedly fabricated rumors about \" military vehicles entering Beijing \" had been detained and 16 websites closed for fake online information , according to police authorities . \" What we ' ve done and will do is to make sure residents can know what they want to know , say what they think and supervise our management in a reliable and useful network environment , \" Liu said . Liu disagreed that the Internet can police itself against rumors , and told China Daily that some netizens ca n ' t distinguish truth from fiction , \" requiring government departments and website companies to take measures \" . On Monday , the Internet Society of China posted a proposal calling on Internet companies and websites to strengthen self - discipline and prevent the spread of online rumors . In response , three main Internet companies in the country - Sina , Baidu and Tencent - said they will target fake information with advanced technology and invest in manpower to supervise online information . Zhao Zhiguo , deputy director of the Telecommunications Administration under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology , said stricter self - management of websites will help banish online rumors . \" Internet companies should take legal responsibility when operating their websites . They should not become a hotbed for rumors and provide opportunities for fake information , \" Zhao said , adding they will launch similar crackdowns to close illegal website companies and punish those responsible . Currently , people who make or spread rumors related to terrorism and securities trading , or information affecting State security and companies ' commercial reputations , will face criminal punishment . Liu Honghui , a Beijing lawyer specializing in online cases , said he welcomed the government ' s action to curb online rumors . \" Residents used online banks to shop or book flights , which needs a safe platform without fake information , \" he said . Yu Guofu , another lawyer from Sheng Feng Law Firm , said the key to reducing rumors is netizens themselves . \"", "questions": "Who plays an important role in reducing Internet - based rumors ?", "options": {"model": ["micro - bloggers", "users"], "human": ["Internet companies", "Micro - bloggers"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
