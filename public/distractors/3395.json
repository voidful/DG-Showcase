{"id": "3395", "article": "Last night my husband and I were on the way to a show . We were both hungry and wanted to grab a quick bite on our way there , so we swung through a Jack - In - the - Box - Drive - thru Restaurant and placed our order . When we got up to the window the lady smiled at me , which is sometimes rare and asked how I was doing while she was collecting our money for the food . I replied , \" Fine , and how are you ' ? \" She went to get our order ready and I asked my husband to pass my \" Drive - thru Smile bag \" to me . He handed it to me and watched in amazement as I gathered together a \" You make a difference \" paper , including a smile card , a smile stamp and a smile button . She came back to the window almost before I finished putting it all together . Without looking too closely she passed the bag and said , \" Thank you . Have a good day . \" I said , \" Wait ! This is for you . \" As I placed the little smile gifts in her hand a smile spread across her face . As she looked at the items it got a little bigger but when I thanked her for her smile there was no holding back . She gave the biggest smile and she was laughing . It was very heartwarming . My husband was very impressed by it . It made him smile too . It just takes a little effort to connect in a human way to everyone we have dealings with , even with something as small as a Drive - thru transaction . Remember , we all make a difference !", "questions": "What may be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["a visit to a visit drive - thru smile while taking a visit drive - thru smile", "biggest drive - thru smile ever", "a visit to a visit drive"], "human": ["Jack - In - the - Box - Drive - thru Restaurant", "Do n ' t hold back Your Smile", "Biggest Drive - thru Smile Ever"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
