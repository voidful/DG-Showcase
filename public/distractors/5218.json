{"id": "5218", "article": "Human remains of ancient settlements will be reburied and lost to science under a law that threatens research into the history of humans in Britain , a group of leading archaeologists says . In a letter addressed to the justice secretary , Ken Clarke , 40 archaeologists write of their \" deep and widespread concern \" about the issue . It centers on the law introduced by the Ministry of Justice in 2008 which requires all human remains unearthed in England and Wales to be reburied within two years , regardless of their age . The decision means scientists have too little time to study bones and other human remains of national and cultural significance . \" Your current requirement that all archaeologically unearthed human remains should be reburied , whether after a standard period of two years or further special extension , is contrary to basic principles of archaeological and scientific research and of museum practice , \" they write . The law applies to any pieces of bone uncovered at around 400 dig sites , including the remains of 60 or so bodies found at Stonehenge in 2008 that date back to 3 , 000 BC . Archaeologists have been granted a temporary extension to give them more time , but eventually the bones will have to be returned to the ground . The arrangements may result in the waste of future discoveries at sites such as Happisburgh in Norfolk , where digging is continuing after the discovery of stone tools made by early humans 950 , 000 years ago . If human remains were found at Happisburgh , they would be the oldest in northern Europe and the first indication of what this species was . Under the current practice of the law those remains would have to be reburied and effectively destroyed . Before 2008 , guidelines allowed for the proper preservation and study of bones of sufficient age and historical interest , while the Burial Act 1857 applied to more recent remains . The Ministry of Justice assured archaeologists two years ago that the law was temporary , but has so far failed to revise it . Mike Parker Pearson , an archaeologist at Sheffield University , said : \" Archaeologists have been extremely patient because we were led to believe the ministry was sorting out this problem , but we feel that we can not wait any longer . \" The ministry has no guidelines on where", "questions": "What can be inferred about the British law governing human remains ?", "options": {"model": ["the ministry of justice has not done enough about the law .", "the government does n ' t agree with the law .", "it does n ' t matter whether human remains are reburied or not .", "the british government is in favor of the law against human remains ."], "human": ["The Ministry of Justice did not intend it to protect human remains .", "The Burial Act 1857 only applied to remains uncovered before 1857 .", "The law on human remains has n ' t changed in recent decades .", "The Ministry of Justice has not done enough about the law ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
