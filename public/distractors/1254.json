But an equally key figure is co - founder Isao Takahata , who has recently made a new feature , The Tale of Princess Kagnya . It is an unforgettable feature with an unusual hand - drawn aesthetic . The title character is a tiny baby girl who appears in a bamboo plant . She is found by a woodcutter , who takes her home and brings her up . He believes the little girl is a princess , and sets about preparing what he regards as a suitable world for her . This original story is the oldest work of fiction in Japan ; every child knows it in its simplified folktale form . \" It is a fascinating story with elements of wonder , humour , and sorrow , ' ' Takahata says , \" but these three elements are scattered about . \" The chief challenge for anyone trying to adapt it is that \" we are completely unable to comprehend what was in the heart of Princess Kaguya . Because of this , despite its being well known , few people consider it interesting . There have been several attempts at making a film out of the story , but they ended up being abandoned . \" He was connected with one of these attempts , but no one paid any attention to his concept . \" Fifty - five years later , I thought my concept was still appealing , and used it as a basis for turning the story into a feature film . \" His concept involves the princess ' s origins , her expectations and her access to \" the full range of human emotions \" . To realize his vision , Takahata says , \" I needed to take the extremely individualistic brushwork and key designs of Osamu Tanabe and Kazuo Oga , two brilliantly talented artists , and have them permeate throughout the film . The two of them drew many pictures , but they were n ' t nearly enough . The most challenging part was to have all the other animation staff copy their styles in a free and easy way . \" The Tale of Princess Kaguya has been released", "questions": "Why is it challenging to adapt the original story to a feature film according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["because people are in the dark about the feelings of princess kaguya .", "because there is a variety of film in the film .", "because it is the main characters of the story ' s story ."], "human": ["Because the story itself offers a combination of wonder , humour and sorrow .", "Because the story is too old to appeal to the audience nowadays .", "Because people are in the dark about the feelings of Princess Kaguya ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
