{"id": "2313", "article": "\" I like your smile , but unlike you put your shoes on my face \" . A charming way of saying \" Keep off the grass \" . But could you figure it out ? Or this : \" Wash Clothing Store \" for laundry . They are both typical Chinglish , a combination of English vocabulary and Chinese grammar . Expressions such as \" people mountain people sea \" , means extremely crowded , and \" give you some color to see \" , meaning a punishment , are widely known and recognized . Chinglish has been attracting global attention in recent years as China grows rapidly in status on the world stage , attracting both fans and detractors . The Beijing Speaks Foreign Languages Programme and English First China Company , a language trainer known as EF Education , jointly launched a campaign to root out poor grammar and misused vocabulary in downtown Beijing . They argue Chinglish is an embarrassment that we should let it die out at all costs . \" It is meaningful to allow the capital to show its most beautiful historical and cultural heritage to the world . \" Michael Lu , vice - president of EF Education said , \" since the launching of the campaign , foreign teachers and students had been very keen to volunteer participation . \" He believed signs were very important in public services . \" The signs in some old buildings confused foreign visitors . Chinglish , although the target of much criticism , has also won supporters who regard it as an interesting way for foreigners to learn how Chinese people think and express themselves . \" Many Chinglish logos carry Chinese elements and they will enrich the English language , \" 32 - year - old Oliver Radtke said . He had even published a book \" Chinglish : Found in Translation , \" on the subject . About 50 , 000 copies of the book have been sold since it was published in 2007 . Some Chinese university experts also side with Chinglish . \" English has absorbed elements from other languages such as French and Spanish in its growth , and the emergence of Chinglish again testifies to the language ' s vitality and inclusiveness , \" said Shi Anbin , an associate professor of Tsinghua University .", "questions": "According to Oliver Radtke , Chinglish", "options": {"model": ["has won popularity of ef education", "shows how chinese people think", "shows how chinese people think and express themselves"], "human": ["does damage to the English language", "shows the great humor of Chinese people", "shows how Chinese people think"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
