{"id": "5317", "article": "There was a gardener who looked after his garden with great care . To water his flowers , he used two buckets . One was a shiny and new bucket . The other was a very old and _ one , which had seen many years of service , but was now past its best . Every morning , the gardener would fill up the two buckets . Then he would carry them along the path , one on each side , to the flowerbeds . The new bucket was very proud of itself . It could carry a full bucket of water without a single drop spilled . The old bucket felt very ashamed because of its holes : before it reached the flowerbeds , much water had leaked along the path . Sometimes the new bucket would say , \" See how great I am ! How good it is that the gardener has me to water the flowers every day ! I do n ' t know why he still bothers with you . What a waste of space you are ! \" And all that the old bucket could say was . \" I know I am not very useful , but I can only do my best . I am happy that the gardener still finds a little bit of use in me , at least . \" One day , the gardener heard that kind of conversation . After watering the flowers as usual , he said , \" You both have done your work very well . Now I am going to carry you back . I want you to look carefully along the path . \" Then the two buckets did so . All along the path , they noticed , on the side where the new bucket was carried , there was just bare earth ; on the other side where the old bucket was carried , there was a joyous row of wild flowers , leading all the way to the garden .", "questions": "The new bucket made conversations with the old one mainly to", "options": {"model": ["praise the gardener ' s words", "laugh at the old one", "criticize the gardener"], "human": ["feel sorry about the old one", "praise the gardener ' s kindness", "laugh at the old one"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
