{"id": "2737", "article": "A young boy was sitting in the back seat of the car eating an apple . He asked his father , \" Why does my apple turn brown ? \" his father answered , \" When the skin is removed , air reaches the flesh of the apple and causes oxidation . This changes the apple ' s molecular structure and results in a brownish color . \" The boy asked , \" Daddy , what are you talking about ? \" I know how that boy feels . Sometimes I want answers to some of those confusing questions that we all meet with , such as how to get through difficult times or what to do in a tough situation . I just want to get it right . The problem is that I do n ' t always have the answer I need . Nobody else seems to have them , either . So I go on making mistakes and think that I ' ll never get it right . Often I did n ' t know what to do . I often made poor choices , but I gradually improved . Then I realized that I do n ' t HAVE TO always get it right . I do n ' t have to always know what to do all the time . All I really need to do is try my best , learn from my mistakes and go on . Dr . Leo Buscaglia once said , \" No one gets out of this world alive , so the time to live , learn , care , share , celebrate and love is now . That would be pretty hard to do when you ' re waiting for all the answers first . \" So you got it wrong . You made a mistake . So what should you do next ? Forgive yourself and try again . You may not get out of this world alive , but you can get plenty of life out of this world if you are not too worried about always getting it right .", "questions": "How did the boy feel when he heard his father ' s explanation ?", "options": {"model": ["he felt it was difficult to understand .", "he felt sorry for what he did .", "he did n ' t know how to get the right answer ."], "human": ["He knew what his father meant .", "He thought that he had learned a lot from his father .", "He felt it was difficult to understand ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
