{"id": "5523", "article": "Long after the 1998 World Cup was won , disappointed fans were still cursing the disputed refereeing decisions that denied victory to their team . A researcher was appointed to study the performance of some top referees . The researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams . Each match lasted an hour , divided into three periods of 20 minutes during which different referees were in charge . Observers noted down the referees ' errors , of which there were 61 over the tournament . Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes , each referee made almost 23 mistakes , a remarkably high number . The researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail . Surprisingly , he found that errors were more likely when the referees were close to the incident . When the officials got it right , they were , on average , 17 meters away from the action . The average distance in the case of errors was 12 meters . The research shows the optimum distance is about 20 meters . There also seemed to be an optimum speed . Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second . The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second . If FIFA , football ' s international ruling body , wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup , it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance , rather than rushing to keep up with the ball , the researcher argues . He also says that FIFA ' s insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided . If keeping up with the action is not so important , their physical condition is less critical .", "questions": "The number of refereeing errors in the experimental matches was", "options": {"model": ["too large", "too high", "quite unexpected"], "human": ["higher than in the 1998 World Cup", "as high as in a standard match", "quite unexpected"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
