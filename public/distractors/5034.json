{"id": "5034", "article": "Several days ago , I was walking home from school and saw some writing on the fence of a house I was passing by . It said , \" Happiness is a direction , not a destination . \" I had been having a bad day and just reading this brightened my day a little . I also took out a pen and wrote one of my favorite quotes down . ww . szzx100 . com When I came back to the fence , I saw another quote under mine in the handwriting as the first one . I added another , and we kept at this pattern for quite a while . One day , I was writing another quote on the fence and the old man , one of my neighbors , who owned the fence , saw me . He came out and I was afraid he would be mad at me for writing on his fence ; he was not known to be very friendly . He gave me a sharp glance and then read the quotes on the fence . Without saying a word , he said something to himself and then went back inside . I was a bit terrified for a while , afraid to go back to the fence , but when I did , I noticed not more quotes but two words in entirely different handwriting had been added , \" Thank you . \" Later , I saw the old man in his front yard . He beckoned me over and told me how my quotes had been inspiring him , how he thanked me and how he was glad to see young people still have \" values \" . We are now good friend and I talk to him a lot . This experience has changed my life . I still do n ' t know who wrote that very first quote , but if he is out there , I ' d like to say \" thanks \" to that unknown friend .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["the old man is a good writer", "the old man has changed his opinion about young people .", "the old man does n ' t like writing on the fence ."], "human": ["writing quotes on fences is a good idea", "the writer has written three quotes on the fence", "the old man has changed his opinion about young people ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
