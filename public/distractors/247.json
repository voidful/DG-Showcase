{"id": "247", "article": "Can you believe your eyes ? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age . Martin Doherty , a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland , led the team of scientists . In this experiment , Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people , using pictures of some orange circles . The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people . The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10 , and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25 . The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background . One of the circles was larger than the other , and these people were asked to identify the larger one . Four - year - olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time . Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time . Next , both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles , again of different sizes , were surrounded by gray circles . Here ' s where the trick lies in . In some of the pictures , the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles - - making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle , which was the real larger one . And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles - - so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle . When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures , they were n ' t fooled - - they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before . Older children and adults , on the other hand , did not do as well . Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one , and adults got it wrong most of the time . As children get older , Doherty said , their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context . In other words , they will begin to process the whole picture at once : the tricky gray circles , as well as the orange circle in the middle . As a result , they ' re more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick .", "questions": "Doherty and his team of scientists did an experiment to evaluate", "options": {"model": ["the different colors of different colors", "people ' s ability to see accurately", "the difference between people ' s color1 and other types", "people ' s memory of the same picture"], "human": ["children ' s and adults ' eye - sight", "children ' s and adults ' brains", "the influence of people ' s age", "people ' s ability to see accurately"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
