{"id": "146", "article": "Our \" Mommy and Me \" time began two years ago . My next - door neighbor and fellow mother , Christie , and I were out in our front yards , watching seven children of age 6 and under ride their bikes up and down . \" I wish I could take one of my children out alone , \" said Christie . Then we worked out a plan : When Christie takes one of her children out , I ' ll watch her other three . And when she watches two of mine , I ' ll take someone out . The children were extremely quick to accept the idea of \" Mommy and Me \" time . Christie ' s daughter , McKenzie , went first . When she returned , the other children showered her with tons of questions . McKenzie was smiling broadly . Christie looked refreshed and happy . \" She ' s like a different child when there ' s no one else around , \" Christie shared with me quietly . With her mother all to herself , McKenzie did n ' t have to make an effort to gain attention . Just as Christie had noticed changes in McKenzie , I also discovered something different in each of my children during our alone times . For example , I am always surprised when my daughter , who is seldom close to me , holds my hand frequently . My stuttering son , Tom , does n ' t stutter once during our activities since he does n ' t have to struggle for a chance to speak . And the other son , Sam , who ' s always a follower when around other children shines as a leader during our times together . The \" Mommy and Me \" time allows us to be simply alone and away with each child - talking , sharing , and laughing , which has been the biggest gain . Every child deserves to be an only child at least once in a while .", "questions": "The author seems to believe that", "options": {"model": ["it ' s better to be a child", "every child needs parents ' full attention", "it ' s important to have a child alone"], "human": ["it ' s tiring to look after three children", "parents should watch others ' children", "every child needs parents ' full attention"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
