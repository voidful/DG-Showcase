Robert Bruce , leader of the Scots in the 13th century , was hiding in a cave from the English . He watched a spider making a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock . He tried six times . On the seventh time he made it and went on to make his web . Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English . Edison , the inventor of the light bulb , made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one . Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often , he replied , \" Failure ? I have no failure . Now I know 50 , 000 ways it wo n ' t work . \" So what ? First , always think about your failure . What caused it ? Were conditions right ? Were you in top form yourself ? What can you change so things will go right next time ? Second , is the goal you ' re trying to reach the right one ? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be . Think about this question , \" If I do succeed in this , where will it get me ? \" This may help you prevent failure in things you should n ' t be doing anyway .
