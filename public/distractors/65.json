{"id": "65", "article": "Before the early 1960 ' s people interested in the differing roles of the left and right hemispheres of the brain depended almost entirely on facts drawn from animal research , form studies of patients with one - sided brain damage . But it was possible to find out which brain hemisphere was most involved in speech and other functions in normal people by having them listen to two different words coming to the two ears at the same time . This became known as the \" dichotic listening \" procedure . When several word pairs are given in a row , people are unable to report them all , and most right - handers prefer to report , and report more correctly , words given to their right ears . This seems to be related to the fact that signals from the right ear , although sent to both hemispheres , are better sent to the left hemisphere which controls speech . People who have speech represented in the right hemisphere , a very unusual occurrence even in left - handed people , more correctly report what their left ears hear . In contrast to the right - ear advantage for speech , there is generally a left - ear advantage for another type of auditory signal : music . When right - handed people listen to melodic patterns they report them better from the left ear .", "questions": "according to the passage , music is best appreciated when heard by", "options": {"model": ["right - handed people", "the left ear of right - handers", "left - handed people", "the left ear of right - handed people"], "human": ["people with a left - ear advantage", "left - handers in their right ears", "right - handed people who understand melodic patterns", "the left ear of right - handers"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
