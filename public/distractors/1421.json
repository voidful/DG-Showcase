{"id": "1421", "article": "Throughout history , people have been interested in knowing how language first began , but no one knows exactly where or how this happened . However , we do know a lot about languages , the languages of today and also the languages of earlier times . There are probably about three thousand languages in the world today . Chinese is the language with the most speakers . English , Russian and Spanish are also spoken by many millions of people . On the other hand , some languages in the world have less than one hundred speakers . There are several important families of languages in the world . For example , most of the languages of Europe are in one large family called Indo - European . The original language of this family was spoken about 4 , 500 years ago . Many of the present day languages of Europe and India are modern forms of the language of 4 , 500 years ago . Languages are always changing . The English of today is very different from the English of 500 years ago . In time some even die out completely . About 1 , 000 years ago English was a little - known relative of German spoken on one of the borders of Europe . If a language has a lot of speakers or if it is very old , there may be differences in the way it is spoken in different areas . That is , the language may have several dialects . Chinese is a good example of dialect differences . Chinese has been spoken for thousands of years by many millions of speakers . The differences between the dialects of Chinese are so great that speakers of Chinese from some parts of China can not understand speakers from other parts .", "questions": "Many European and Indian languages", "options": {"model": ["are no longer the same as the old", "come from the same family"], "human": ["were once a relative of English", "come from the same family"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
