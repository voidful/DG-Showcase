When you are teaching them , remember to stress safety and cleanliness , after all these are skills they will need for many years into the future . Start by finding simple no - cook recipes . A salad or other no - cook recipe is an ideal way to start . Show your child how to hold , and cut with knives . Make sure they know how to wash everything in hot soapy water as they use it , so that it becomes a habit that is part of the process and not an extra chore to do after they have finished . If possible , find one of the good children ' s cookbooks that are available . Many of these have simple recipes that demonstrate the basic cooking terms such as chop , mix , and stir . When it is practical , you may as well have your child help you prepare meals . Even a small child can get bowls out , pour , and start learning to measure . A two - year - old child can stir a batter , or taste the results . Allow your older child to find a recipe that they think sounds nice . Go over the recipe with them as you discuss the steps needed , and how to adjust any ingredients to match your budget , and family preferences . When you go shopping , have your child help find the necessary ingredients for their ' special ' recipe . When it is time to make the recipe , allow them to do as much as possible , only helping out if asked or when they run into trouble . Be sure to praise their efforts even if they are not perfect . After the results are gone , talk about any problems , and see if there is a solution . Most children like to cook , and if they are part of deciding what to cook , as well as the preparation they will be well on the way to being good cooks .", "questions": "Why should we tell children safety and cleanliness ?", "options": {"model": ["because they will develop good habits", "because they will be able to cook with a special cooking skill ."], "human": ["Because children are often careless", "Because they will develop good habits"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
