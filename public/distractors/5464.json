{"id": "5464", "article": "Do you find getting up in the morning so difficult that it ' s painful ? This might be called laziness , but Dr . Kleitman has a new explanation . He has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle . During the hours when you labour through your work you may say that you ' re \" hot \" . That ' s true . The time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak . For some people the peak comes during the forenoon . For others it comes in the afternoon or evening No one has discovered why this is so , but it leads to such familiar monologues as : \" Get up , John ! You ' ll be late for work again ! \" The possible explanation to the trouble is that John is at his temperature - and - energy peak in the evening . Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what these energy cycles mean , and which cycle each member of the family has . You ca n ' t change your energy cycle , but you can learn to make your life fit it better . Habit can help , Dr . Kleitman believes . Maybe you ' re sleepy in the evening but feel you must stay up late anyway . Counteract ( / ) your cycle to some extent by habitually staying up later than you want to . If your energy is low in the morning but you have an important job to do early in the day , rise before your usual hour . This wo n ' t change your cycle , but you ' ll get up steam and work better at your low point . Get off to a slow start which saves your energy . Get up with a leisurely yawn and stretch . Sit on the edge of the bed a minute before putting your feet on the floor . Avoid the troublesome search for clean clothes by laying them out the night before . Whenever possible , do routine work in the afternoon and save tasks requiring more energy or concentration for your sharper hours .", "questions": "What ' s the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["how to get energy", "daily energy cycle", "temperages of energy"], "human": ["Save Your Energy", "Temperature - and - Energy Peak", "Daily Energy Cycle"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
