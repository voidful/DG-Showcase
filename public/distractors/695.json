{"id": "695", "article": "In the famous fairy tale , Snow White eats the Queen ' s apple and falls victim to a curse ; in Shakespeare ' s novel , Romeo drinks the poison and dies ; some ancient Chinese kings took pills that contained mercury , believing that it would make them _ , but they died afterwards . Poison has long been an important part in literature and history , and it seems to always be about evil , danger and death . But how much do you really know about poison ? An exhibition , The Power of Poison , opened last month at the American Museum of Natural History in New York , intended to give the audience a more vivid understanding of poison . The exhibition will continue until Feb . 2016 , reported The New York Times . The museum tour starts in a rainforest setting , where you can see live examples of some of the most poisonous animals : caterpillars , frogs and spiders . Golden poison frogs , for instance , are n ' t much bigger than a coin , but their skin is covered in a poison that can cut off the signaling power of your nerves , and a single frog has enough venom to kill 10 grown humans . The exhibition also features interactive activities . In an iPad - based game , visitors are presented with three puzzling illnesses and asked to identify the poisons based on symptoms . In one case , for example , a pet dog is found sick in a backyard and visitors have to figure out whether it was the toad , the leaky batteries in the trash or the dirty pond water that did it . \" Poisons can be bad for some things , \" Michael Novacek , senior vice president of the museum , told NBC News . \" Yet they can also be good for others . \" This is what visitors learn from the last part of the exhibition , which displays how poisons can be used favorably by humans , including for medical treatment . The blood toxins of vampire bats , for example , can prevent blood from clotting , which may protect against strokes . A poisonous chemical found in the yew tree is effective against cancer , which is what led to the invention of a cancer - fighting drug called Taxol . One chemical in the venom of Gila monsters can lower the blood sugar of its victims , so it has been used to treat diabetes .", "questions": "What is the main purpose of the exhibition The Power of Poison ?", "options": {"model": ["to show people the good effects of poison", "to give people more knowledge about poison ."], "human": ["To show how poison has been used for medical treatment .", "To give people more knowledge about poison ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
