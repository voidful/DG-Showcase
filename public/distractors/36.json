{"id": "36", "article": "Until late in the 20th century , most Americans spent time with people of generations . Now mid - aged Americans may not keep in touch with old people until they are old themselves . That ' s because we group people by age . We put our three - year - olds together in day - care center , our 13 - year - olds in school and sports activities , and our 80 - year - olds in senior - citizen homes . Why ? We live away from the old for many reasons : young people sometimes avoid the old to get rid of fears for aging and dying . It is much harder to watch . someone we love disappear before our eyes . Sometimes it ' s so hard that we stay away from the people who need us most . Fortunately , . some of us have found our way to the old . And we have discovered that they often save the young . A reporter moved her family onto a block filled with old people . At first her children were disappointed . But the reporter baked banana bread for the neighbours and had her children deliver it and visit . Soon the children had many new friends , with whom they shared food , stories and projects . \" My children have never been less lonely , \" the reporter said . The young , in turn , save the old . Once I was in a rest home when a visitor showed up with a baby . She was immediately surrounded . People who had n ' t gotten out of bed in a week suddenly were ringing for a wheelchair . Even those who had seemed asleep wake up to watch the child . Babies have an astonishing power to comfort and cure . Grandparents are a special case . They give grandchildren a feeling of security and continuity . As my husband put it , \" my grandparents gave me a deep sense that things would turn out right in the end . \" Grandchildren speak of attention they do n ' t get from worried parents . \" My parents were always telling me to hurry up , and my grandparents told me to slow down , \" one friend said . A teacher told me she can tell which pupils have relationships with grandparents : they are quieter , calmer , more trusting .", "questions": "The fact that the reporter told us shows that", "options": {"model": ["old people do n ' t like being with their parents", "old people do n ' t like to stay away from others", "old people are old", "old people are easy to get along with"], "human": ["old people in America lead a hard life", "old people in America enjoy banana bread", "she had no time to take care of her children", "old people are easy to get along with"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
