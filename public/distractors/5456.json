Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity , the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to be consistent to a stereotype , a US study says . Boys at single - sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their abilities to express their emotions , rather than feeling they had to obey to the \" boy code \" of hiding their emotions to be a \" real man \" . The findings of the study are against the received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls . Tony Little , headmaster of Eton , warned that boys were being ignored by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls . He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls . The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills . But in single - sex schools teachers can adjust lessons to boys ' learning style , letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom , wrote the study ' s author , Abigail James of the University of Virginia . Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with \" boy - focused \" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them . Because boys generally have sharper vision , learn best through touch , and are physically more active , they need to be given \" hands - on \" lessons where they are allowed to walk around . \" Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modem type in which violence and sexism are major themes , \" James wrote . Single - sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to give in to a stereotype that men should be \" masterful and in charge \" in relationships . \" In mixed schools boys feel pressed to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means , \" the study reported .", "questions": "The author believes that a single - sex school would", "options": {"model": ["help boys to develop their abilities to express their emotions in their own way", "give boys the chance to develop their abilities", "encourage boys to express their emotions more freely", "give boys the chance to develop their ability to express their emotions"], "human": ["force boys to hide their emotions to be \" real men \"", "help to form masculine aggressiveness in boys", "naturally place emphasis on the traditional image of a man to boys", "encourage boys to express their emotions more freely"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
