{"id": "74", "article": "For many years there ' s been a debate about rewarding our children . Does it work ? Is it effective ? Some people think we should establish a standard with our kids and give them something for meeting this standard as a reward . Punishment is given out in much the same way , but it ' s used when certain standards of performance , behavior , etc . have not been met .
