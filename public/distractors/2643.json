{"id": "2643", "article": "An Apple employee is in trouble after the prototype of its top - secret iPhone5 was left in a bar . The as yet unreleased prototype was supposedly \" misplaced \" at Cava22 in San Francisco . Apple ' s security team was called in after reports that it had been sold over the internet for PS120 . However , technology website Cnet . co . uk reports that the San Francisco Police Department said Apple had not reported the item as lost . Cava22 owner Jose Valle has said that neither the SFPD nor Apple have contacted him , although he does remember getting calls about a lost iPhone last month . It follows a very similar incident in April 2010 when a then - unreleased iPhone4 was left in a beer garden of a German bar in California by an Apple engineer . The lost iPhone4 was also sold over the internet to the technology blog , which paid PS3 , 000 . The incident led to Apple strengthening its already stiff security , for it seems difficult to believe that a virtually identical incident would happen for the second time in two years .", "questions": "What can we infer from the text ?", "options": {"model": ["the apple officials felt quite angry about the incident .", "the owner of the iphone was not satisfied with the product .", "the apple official did n ' t agree to help him .", "the iphone4 was sold over the internet ."], "human": ["The iPhone5 prototype was left in the bar on purpose .", "The owner of Cava22 got the iPhone5 prototype .", "The SFPD contacted the bar owner for the incident .", "The Apple officials felt quite angry about the incident ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
