{"id": "5562", "article": "Love Is Just a Thread Sometimes I really doubt whether there is love between my parents . Every day they are very busy trying to earn money to pay the high tuition for us . They do n ' t act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV . \" I love you \" is too luxurious for them to say . Sending flowers to each other on Valentine ' s Day is even more _ . My father is easy to lose his temper , especially when he ' s very tired from the hard work . One day , my mother was sewing a quilt . I silently sat beside her and asked her if there was love between them . \" What ? \" she replied , still doing her work . My mother stopped her work and raised her head with surprise . She did n ' t answer immediately . Then she bowed her head and continued sewing the quilt . I was in a great embarrassment and I did n ' t know what to do . But at last I heard my mother say the following words : \" Look at this thread . Sometimes it appears , but most of it disappears in the quilt . The thread really makes the quilt strong and durable . If life is a quilt , then love should be a thread . It can hardly be seen anywhere or anytime , but it ' s really there . Love is inside . \" I listened carefully but I could n ' t understand her until the next spring . My father suddenly got sick seriously . My mother had to stay with him in the hospital for a month . When they returned from the hospital , they both seemed as if they had a serious illness . Every day in the morning and dusk , my mother helped my father walk slowly on the country road . It seemed they were the most harmonious couple . There were many beautiful flowers , green grass and trees , and the sun gently glistened through the leaves . All of these made up the most beautiful picture in the world . When we were worrying about him , he said gently : \" I really like walking with your mom . I like this kind of life . \" Reading his eyes , I know he loves my mother deeply . Once I thought love meant flowers , gifts and sweet kisses . But from this experience , I understand that love is just a thread in the quilt of our life .
