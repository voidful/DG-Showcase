{"id": "537", "article": "In America , parents tend to encourage their children to develop their potential to the fullest extent . Fathers and mothers frequently teach their children both ambition and the confidence necessary to work toward their goals . American parents are always active in concentrating on what their kids can do , not what they ca n ' t . As a result , millions of American boys and girls grow up hoping to become actors and athletes , diplomats and doctors . Many of them even want to become president . American parents often encourage their children to become involved in extra activities of all types at school , such as student government , sports and music . They believe that only through taking part in these activities can their children become mature young adults . As we all know , schoolwork is important . But parents should realize that the social skills their children learn form natural conversations with each other are as important as schoolwork and the skills they will need in the future work . What ' s more important in their work is that their children should have a sound knowledge of physics or the ability to communicate effectively . As a rule , Chinese parents do n ' t educate their children about the same kind of ambition and confidence as Americans do , nor do they encourage the same level of participation in extra activities . Children are typically advised to study hard and pass exams . They have to spend a lot of time in doing much schoolwork every day . It is a great waste of time to do so . Now more and more Chinese parents have recognized that they should pay attention to developing the potential of their children . I hope that leaders in Chinese educational circles should take some measures to develop the potential of their children . I am very confident about it .", "questions": "According to the passage , Chinese parents", "options": {"model": ["do n ' t allow their children to attend extra activities at school", "do n ' t allow their children to do extra activities", "do n ' t allow their children to take part in extra activities at school", "do n ' t encourage their children to participate in extra activities"], "human": ["know more than American parents to educate their children", "owning ambition and confidence is necessary and important", "pay much more attention to their children ' s fine future", "do n ' t encourage their children to participate in extra activities"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
