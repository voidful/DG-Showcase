{"id": "2929", "article": "Patients and doctors alike have long believed in the healing power of humor . It is claimed that humor not only affects patients ' moods , but can actually help them recover faster . Several studies seem to support this . Patients in better spirits are known to have higher immune cell counts . Some have even claimed to have healed themselves of serious illnesses by reading comics and watching comedies . Despite all this , many researchers are not convinced . They point out the fact that many sufferings have been known to disappear naturally , with or without a daily dose of laughter . They also say that while optimism in general does seem to be related to better health , it is hard to tell which comes first . Humor in times of stress , however , clearly makes us feel better . On one level , it takes our minds off our troubles and relaxes us . On another , it releases powerful endorphins , a chemical produced by your body that reduces pain . There are cases where the appreciation of a good joke is indeed directly related to a person ' s health . It can show , for example , whether a person has suffered damage to one particular area of the brain : the right frontal lobe . Scientists confirmed this by having people read jokes and asking them to choose the funniest endings from a list . Subjects with normal brains usually chose endings that were based on a relatively complex synthesis of ideas . Subjects with specifically located brain damage , however , responded only to slapstick endings , which did not depend on a particular context . When pressed , the brain - damaged subjects saw the logic in the correct endings . They simply did not find them funny . Of course , humor is largely an individual matter . Next time your friend does not get one of your jokes , there is no need to accuse him of being a lamebrain . However , you might suggest that he lighten up - - for the health of it .", "questions": "Scientists had some people read jokes and asked them to choose the funniest endings from a list to confirm that", "options": {"model": ["a person suffering certain brain damage does n ' t appreciate a good joke", "a person who does n ' t care about jokes is sure to be a good person", "a person with a good sense of humor is more likely to be a good doctor", "a person with a certain area of the brain is a person ' s brain"], "human": ["the brain - damaged people are different from those with normal brains", "a person with a normal brain usually responds to slapstick endings", "humor takes our minds off our troubles by releasing powerful endorphins", "a person suffering certain brain damage does n ' t appreciate a good joke"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
