The creature ' s astonishing journey was witnessed by a woman walking her dog as the two - foot bird waddled out of the water in front of her . She said , \" It was out of this world to see it . It was this glistening white thing standing up on the sand and I thought I was seeing things . \" The tale of the lost penguin is similar to the 2006 children ' s film Happy Feet , in which a young penguin finds himself far from home during a voyage of discovery . Conservationists believe it has completed an incredible journey for such a young bird - - it is estimated to be around 10 months old . The most likely explanation for its appearance in New Zealand is the hunt for food . Experts said it may also have rested on an ice floe during its travels and was carried north for a great distance before it made a swim for dry land . Colin Miskelly , a curator of New Zealand Museum , said , \" They can spend months at a time in the ocean and come ashore only to moult ( , ) or rest . \" Mr . Miskelly said the brave bird would have to find its way back south soon if it was going to survive . He said , \" It is probably hot and thirsty and has been eating wet sand . \" \" It does n ' t realize that the sand is n ' t going to melt inside it because they typically eat snow - - their only liquid . \" - - it can inflict painful bites if threatened .", "questions": "What do we know about the penguin according to Mr .
