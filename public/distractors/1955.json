{"id": "1955", "article": "If you ' re like most students , you probably read both at home and outside your home : perhaps somewhere on your schoolyard and maybe even at work during your breaks . Your reading environment can have a great effect on your understanding , so give some thought to how you can create or choose the right reading environments . The right environment allows you to stay alert and to keep all of your attention on the text , especially when it is both interesting and difficult . When you ' re at home , you can usually create effective conditions for reading . You might want to choose a particular place - a desk or table , for example - where you always read . Make sure the place you choose is well lighted , and sit in a chair that requires you to sit straight . Reading in a chair that ' s too soft and comfortable is likely to make you sleepy ! Keep your active reading tools ( pens , markers , notebooks or paper ) and a dictionary close at hand . Before you sit down for a reading period , try to reduce all possible interruptions . Turn off your phone , the television , and the radio . Tell your family members or roommates that you ' ll be busy for a while . If necessary , put a \" Do not disturb \" sign on your door ! The more interruptions you must deal with while you read , the harder it will be to keep your attention on the task at hand .", "questions": "What would be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["how to learn to read", "how to use reads on your reads", "creating an effective reading environment"], "human": ["What to Read", "How to Read Fast", "Creating an Effective Reading Environment"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
