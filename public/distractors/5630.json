{"id": "5630", "article": "PEOPLE who have had a painful experience may wish they could wipe the memory from their minds . Researchers at Johns Hopkins University , US , say that this may someday be possible . A drug remains far off , but researchers have laid a foundation with their discovery that proteins can be removed from the brain ' s fear center to cut memories forever . Previous research had already shown that a special behavior therapy could cut painful memories . But relapse was possible because the memory had n ' t necessarily disappeared . By looking at that process , Richard Huganir and Roger Clem , two researchers from Johns Hopkins University , discovered a \" window of vulnerability \" when proteins are created . The proteins help signals travel within the brain as painful memories are made . Because the proteins are unstable , they can be easily removed with drugs or behavior therapy to cut memories . Researchers used mice to find the window , but think the process would be the same in humans . They used electric shocks to make the mice fear a certain sound . The sound triggered the creation of the proteins , called calcium - permeable AMPARS , which formed for a day or two in the fear centers of the mice ' s brains . The researchers are working on ways to reopen the window by recalling the painful memory and using drugs to remove the protein . They published their report online last month in Science Express . Their research has drawn interest and concern from experts in mental healthcare . Kate Farinholt , a mental health expert with the National Alliance on Mental Illness , Maryland , US , said many people suffering from a painful event might benefit from erasing a memory . \" Erasing a memory and then everything bad built on that is an amazing idea , and I can see all sorts of potential , \" she said . But there are a lot of unanswered questions , too . \" Completely deleting a memory is a little scary . How do you remove a memory without removing a part of someone ' s life , \" Farinholt said . \" And is it best to do that , considering that people grow and learn from their experiences ? \"", "questions": "What have researchers at Johns Hopkins University found recently ?", "options": {"model": ["changing drugs or behavior therapy to cut memories .", "the protein can be removed from the brain ' s fear center .", "the protein can be removed from the brain .", "removing certain proteins from the brain can wipe painful memories ."], "human": ["A new drug to erase painful memories from human brains .", "A special behavior therapy to erase painful memories .", "Erasing memory damages a patient ' s brain functions .", "Removing certain proteins from the brain can wipe painful memories ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
