{"id": "3758", "article": "Tang Zhou and his wife are planning to have their second child , a test - tube baby . His wife had a natural delivery when she was 34 and their first child , a boy , is now 7 . The couple are now hoping to have a daughter through _ in the US . \" My wife could n ' t bear another delivery because of her heart condition and her age . Surrogacy helps avoid the risks to older mothers , \" Tang said , \" Moreover , our second child will be born in the US and become a citizen there . That is not a bad choice . \" The couple spent weeks researching their move , looking for a reliable agency that provides surrogacy services overseas . Surrogacy is still illegal in many countries , including China . \" We will be taking much higher risks by relying on a surrogate mother in China because we are not protected by any regulation or law . You pay a lot of money but may meet with many problems , \" Tang said . \" You might not even get your baby back . \" Tang and his wife are part of an increasing number of Chinese couples who are turning to surrogacy services . Tang also considered surrogacy in Thailand but dropped the idea after recent reports about a baby with Down Syndrome who was delivered through surrogacy and said to have been deserted in Thailand by the biological parents from Australia . Instead , Tang chose the California Surrogacy Center agency as his first option after reading the detailed introduction on its website . Compared with many other agencies that he could contact only via e - mail , the center has a consulting office in Beijing , Tang said . The center is in San Diego , California , and has satellite offices in Los Angeles and Beijing . According to Liu , the center has been operating for more than eight years , and about 100 surrogate mothers live in California .", "questions": "The passage mainly tells us that", "options": {"model": ["the chinese couples are getting a baby back", "chinese couples are making full use of the center", "more chinese couples are turning to surrogacy", "chinese couples are making full use of the child ' s company"], "human": ["an old woman can take a risk of delivering a baby", "it ' s not a bad choice to have a baby born overseas", "biological couples may fail to get their babies back", "more Chinese couples are turning to surrogacy"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
