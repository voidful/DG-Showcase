{"id": "2866", "article": "Not everyone in the world requires the same amount of living space . The amount of space a person needs around him is a cultural difference , not an economic one . Knowing your own psychological space needs is important because they strongly affect your choices , including , for example , the number of bedrooms in the home . If you were brought up in a two - child family and both you and your sister or brother had your own bedrooms , the chances are , if you have two children or more , that you also will offer separate bedrooms for them . In America , for example , they train people to want to have their own rooms by giving them their own rooms when they are babies . This is very rare in the world . In many other countries , the baby sleeps in the same bed with his parents or in bed near them . The space in the home also shows a lot about psychological space needs . Some families gather closer to each other and the size of their house has nothing to do with it . Others have separate little corners where family members go to bed alone . Although it is true that psychological space needs are not decided by economic reasons , they sometimes have to be changed a little because of economic pressures . It is almost impossible , however , to completely change your psychological space needs .", "questions": "The best title for this passage is", "options": {"model": ["difficulties in space", "psychological space", "special space for living"], "human": ["Space Needs in Different Countries", "Psychological Space and Economic Pressure", "Psychological Space"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
