The walk to school would be very , very easy . Such _ clothing is one of the products that could be created using \" wearable robotics \" technology . Designed to improve a person ' s senses and skills , the device could be as simple as a hearing aid . Or it could be a full - body suit that senses what you ' re going to do , then helps you do it better . \" A superman suit would be the final result in wearable robot i cs \" , s a i d Francois Pin , head of robotics and energy systems at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , US . While these suits are at least ten years away , in some areas the technology is already in use . Researchers are developing artificial - arms and legs that allow old , disabled or injured people to move freely . Thus US Army is interested in using wearable robot legs to help soldiers run faster , carry more equipment and be stronger in battle . Jobs that involve lifting heavy loads or saving lives from the rubble of an earthquake could also become much easier . A robot is a device that responds to a command . You ' re probably with simple robots , such as toy cars or airplanes that respond to buttons you push on a remote control . Wearable robotics goes further . Instead of just receiving information through a wire or remotecontrol - the robotic device can send information back to its controller . Suppose you wore a sleeve that has sensors where your joints are . Every time you move your arm , the sleeve senses your movements and sends the information to a robot , which then moves its arm just as you did . When the robot hits or touches something , it sends a signal back to the sleeve and you sense the action . In this way , scientists are working to wrap the robot around the person . Their goal is to make the sleeve , shoe or suit help you do what you want to do .", "questions": "Products resulting from this wearable robotics technology do not include", "options": {"model": ["human ' s feet", "hearing aids", "walking parts"], "human": ["wearable robot legs", "superman suits", "hearing aids"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
