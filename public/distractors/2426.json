{"id": "2426", "article": "Oxford University has introduced confidence classes for female students to get them to compete for jobs in future and win chances to work in best companies . They may be young and gifted but research at the excellent institution has found that female undergraduates are shying away from applying to jobs in banking , finance , management consultancy , engineering and resource management . Partly as a result , starting salaries for women when they graduate are on average PS2 , 000 to PS3 , 000 lower than their male counterparts . \" Women are earning less on leaving Oxford . It is ridiculous , \" said JonathanBlack , the careers service director at the university . \" We have high quality , high achieving students of both genders . But it appears that women are selecting lower paid jobs . They accept more prejudice in certain industries and are saying I wo n ' t struggle for that really high paid job ' . We are not trying to push loads of women but we are trying to say , you should feel able to apply for these sorts of jobs . Boys seem to have a more self - confidence and see the bigger picture generally , even when their self - belief is not necessarily based on any greater academic advantage . \" The four - day programme at Oxford will help 45 female undergraduates improve their self - confidence and decision making , think positively and build on their strengths . Confidence training will teach them how to deal with opposition and challenging situations . Successful female employees from RBS and BP , which are supporting the course , will talk about their lives and careers . RBS ' s involvement follows a promise by the bank toincrease its national percentage of female graduate applications from 35 percent to 50 per cent by 2014 .", "questions": "What is the mistaken idea for female undergraduates ?", "options": {"model": ["they themselves think they are not good as boys .", "they do n ' t think they are suitable as men ."], "human": ["They themselves think men and women are born equal .", "They themselves think they are not good as boys ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
