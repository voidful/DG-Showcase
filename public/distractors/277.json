{"id": "277", "article": "Many science fiction stories tell about explorers arriving in a new world . The explorers then use some kind of high - tech device to test for breathable air or signs of life . But here on Earth , science fiction is becoming reality through a new sampling technology called environmental DNA , or e - DNA for short . Scientists can use it to identify rare or invasive species , study bio - diversity or estimate fish populations with just a little air or water . Ryan Kelly is an ecologist at the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington in Seattle . He works in a laboratory there with other researchers . They study the genetic material released by living creatures . \" Essentially we can take a sample of soil or air - - and in our case - - water , and we can sequence ( to arrange the order of genes ) the DNA out of it and tell you what is there . \" Ryan Kelly says he and his research team are studying water samples collected from Puget Sound . He says the cost of gene sequencing has \" been reduced greatly in recent years . \" That makes DNA testing more widely available . Environmental DNA can be used in two ways . One is to identify the creatures that live in a certain place . The other is to confirm the presence or lack of a specific creature . Caren Goldberg heads the new e - DNA lab at Washington State University in Pullman , Washington . She is one of the first biologists in the northwestern United States to take the technology from the testing phase to actually using it . \" It is extremely useful for species that are really hard to find . I have spent many hours looking for species that I was pretty sure were there - - looking under rocks , looking in water , doing all kinds of surveys . \" Caren Goldberg sees e - DNA as a way to get answers more efficiently , safely and with less destruction compared to traditional survey techniques . Until recently , scientists depended on diving deep , netting or using an electric current to temporarily catch fish . \" We ' re absolutely at this point where proof - of - concept has been established . I do n ' t think everyone necessarily is ready for it yet , but I", "questions": "Despites its advantage , we are still not sure of something about E - DNA .
