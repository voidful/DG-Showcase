{"id": "3487", "article": "Dear Reader : I receive many letters from children and ca n ' t answer them all - - there would n ' t be time enough in a day . That is why I am sending you this printed reply to your letter . I ' ll try to answer some of the questions that are commonly asked . Where did I get the idea for Stuart Little and for Charlotte ' s Web ? Well , many years ago I went to bed one night in a railway sleeping car , and during the night I dreamed about a tiny boy who acted rather like a mouse . That ' s how the story of Stuart Little got started . As for Charlotte ' s Web , I like animals and my barn is a very pleasant place to be , at all hours . One day when I was on my way to feed the pig , I began feeling sorry for the pig because , like most pigs , he was doomed to die .

Gradually I worked the spider into the story that you know , a story of friendship and salvation on a farm . Three years after I started writing it , it was publishe ( I am not a fast worker , as you can see . ) Sometimes I ' m asked how old I was when I started to write , and what made me want to write . I started early - as soon as I could spell . In fact , I ca n ' t remember any time in my life when I was n ' t busy writing .

I was no good at drawing , so I used words instea As I grew older , I found that writing can be a way of earning a living . Some of my readers want me to visit their school . Some want me to send a picture , or an autograph , or a book . And some ask questions about my family and my animals and my pets . Much as I ' d like to , I ca n ' t go visiting . I ca n ' t send books , either - you can find them", "questions": "Which of the following may not be the question asked by E . B .
