{"id": "701", "article": "In the early morning , I headed for the back door and found 10 inches of snow blanketing our home . Oh , no , Bryan would have to clear the roof again , I thought . But Rio rolled onto his back , playing in the white stuff and kicking his back legs , delighted . His days in an animal shelter in New Mexico were long forgotten - - - he had wholeheartedly enjoyed life as a Colorado dog . Rio needed a walk . I had planned to attend an emergent webinar , but my husband was busy clearing . Rio pushed my leg with his snout , wondering why we were still inside . We were overdue for our morning hike . I pulled on my boots reluctantly . I did n ' t have time for this . Rio and I walked a block through our neighborhood to the beginning of a road . Rio leaped happily into the snow , which was up to his neck . But I walked slowly with heavy steps , worrying about my to - do list , and I did n ' t notice that the world around me until Rio started barking . A squirrel chattered at him from a high branch of a pine tree . We had n ' t seen a squirrel in at least a week because of all the storms , so this was a treat for us . Once again , my animal teacher was reminding me to enjoy the present moment , and I was grateful . I took a deep breath ans looked around . Suddenly , there was an explosion of snow . A nearby tree had released its heavy burden , snapping back upright . Silver snowflakes dusted the air around me as a group of birds fled the area , talking to one another as they flew overhead . I watched and listened in wonder for what seemed like a full minute . There would be 1 , 440 minutes in this day , but this was the one I would remember most . Then I looked back to the earth and there was my sweet boy , waiting patiently for a treat . He knew I would want to celebrate this moment we had just shared . \" I love you , Rio ! \" I said as I gave him a cookie . He had trained me well . When we walked home , I smiled broadly , spirit washed clean , ready for whatever the day might bring .", "questions": "Which can be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["a squirrel in a snowflake", "lifted by walk in fallen snow"], "human": ["A busy day with Rio", "Lifted by walk in fallen snow"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
