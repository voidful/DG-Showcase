{"id": "4767", "article": "Many textbooks are not written in the kind of English that we speak every day . In fact , sometimes the reading is so difficult that it almost seems like a foreign language . In a way , it is - - the language of science . You should not expect to be able to read a difficult science passage the same way you read an interesting story ; you should not expect to read it easily and all at once . Instead , you may have to read it several times through , catching on the meaning of difficult words , going back over difficult sentences , and finally putting the whole thing together . Do not be discourages if the whole passage do n ' t make sense to you at first . You need to pick it apart patiently until you can understand it . These are the steps to follow when you are reading something difficult : 1 . Start to read normally until you _ a sentence that does n ' t make sense to you . 2 . When a sentence does n ' t make sense , go back and read it again more slowly . 3 . Look for any word you do n ' t know in the sentence . Try to understand their meanings using word parts and context clues . If necessary , look them up in the dictionary . 4 . Look at the next few sentences to see if they explain more about the sentence you are working on . Do not read very much farther ahead until you understand what is being said . 5 . Finally , read the sentence again . Try to put it into simpler words . 6 . Read through the passage once . Try to understand all the hard parts well . Then read the whole passage once more at a usual speed . This helps you to put all ides together . The stops sound a lot harder than they are . It is really just the normal way good readers understand anything that is difficult to read . After you have done the best you can this way , you should always feel free to ask for help from your teacher , if you have one .", "questions": "The massage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["different ways of learning", "ways of reading science passages"], "human": ["difficulties in reading science", "ways of reading science passages"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
