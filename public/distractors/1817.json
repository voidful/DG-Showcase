John Evans had never found the time or money to make the trip from his home in Forest Fach , near Swansea . But , when British Rail offered him an all - expenses - paid birthday trip to the capital he just could not refuse . He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit , favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole . \" It ' s very exciting . There ' s no doubt about it , \" he said . Until yesterday he had never been far from home , except for one trip to Aberdeen . \" But I ' ve been on the seas to that faraway land called Ilfracombe 21 miles from home , \" he joked . Mr Evans , who spent 60 years working as a miner in South Wales , almost made the journey to London once before , at the turn of the century . \" There was a trip to the White City but it was ten shillings return from Swansea - - too much I thought . All my money went to the family then , \" he said . During the next two days Mr . Evans will be taken on a short tour of London to see the sights . Top of his list is a visit to the House of Parliament organized by his MP , Mr . Gareth Wardell . The only arrangement he does not care for is the wheelchair provided for him if he gets tired . \" I do n ' t like the chair - - people will think I am getting old . \" he said . His secret for a long and healthy life has been well publicized - - no wine , no tobacco and no anger .
