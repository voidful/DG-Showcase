{"id": "192", "article": "Yawning sends out certain messages - either \" Oh , this movie is so boring \" or \" I probably need to get some sleep \" . But did you know that a yawn can also help your brain to cool down when it is overheated ? A new study , led by a research team at Princeton University , has indicated that yawning could be the brain ' s natural way of regulating temperature . People yawn more often when the temperature outdoors is lower than their body temperature but are less likely to yawn when it is hotter outdoors , according to Sciencedaily . com . The research team did an experiment on 160 people , 80 in summer and 80 in winter , to examine how often they yawned at different air temperatures . The study found that people yawned more often in winter than in summer . Scientists say that when the air temperature is lower outside the body , there is heat exchange between the overheated brain and the cool air . But when the air temperature is higher than or equal to the body , people are less likely to yawn because the hot air they breathe in will make the brain even hotter . When people yawn , their jaw is also stretched , which increases blood flow and may also help cool the brain The study showed that the amount someone yawned could be related to the amount of time they spent outside . The longer they spent outside in summer , the less they yawned . Nearly 40 percent of participants yawned within their first five minutes outside , but after that the percentage was reduced to less than 10 percent . However , the result was the opposite in winter . The number of people who yawned increased when they spent more than five minutes outdoors . But the change was only slight compared to summertime . According to Gallup , this is the first report to show that yawning frequencies change depending on season . This could help us to understand better the way our brains work . It may also help us understand the reason why frequent yawning can sometimes be a sign of brain disease .", "questions": "What could be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["climate causes your brain", "yawning cools your brain", "how to get well in your brain"], "human": ["Yawning Is A Sign of Brain Disease", "Yawning Benefits Your Body", "Yawning Cools Your Brain"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
