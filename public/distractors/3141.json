{"id": "3141", "article": "On the last day before Christmas , I hurried to a store to buy some gifts . While looking in the toys section , . I noticed a small boy of about five years old , pressing a doll against his chest . Keeping on touching the hair of the doll , the boy murmured sadly , \" I do n ' t have enough money . What can I do ? \" I walked towards him and asked him curiously who he wanted to give the doll to . \" It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas . She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her . \" I told him that maybe Santa Claus would bring it to her after all and not to worry . However , he replied sadly , \" No , Santa Claus can not take it to where she is now . I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there . \" His eyes looked so sad while saying this . \" My sister has gone to be with God . Daddy says that Mommy will also join God very soon so I think that she can take the doll with her to give it to my sister . \" My heart nearly stopped . The boy looked up at me and said , \" I told Daddy to tell Mommy not to go yet . I asked him to wait until I come back from the store . \" Then , he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing . He told me , \" I also want Mommy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me , I love my Mommy and I wish she did n ' t have to leave me but Daddy says that she has to go and join my little sister . \" Then he looked at the doll again quietly with sad eyes . I quickly reached my hand into my pocket , saying , \" What if we checked again , just in case , to see if you have enough money ? \"", "questions": "What can be inferred from the story ?", "options": {"model": ["something serious happened to the boy ' s mother and sister .", "the boy ' s mother and sister were very sad .", "the boy ' s mother asked him to give the doll to his sister .", "the boy ' s parents did n ' t like the doll ."], "human": ["The boy ' s mother and sister were dying .", "The boy ' s parents had to go to accompany his sister .", "The boy ' s sister had asked him for his photo .", "Something serious happened to the boy ' s mother and sister ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
