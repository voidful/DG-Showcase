{"id": "2222", "article": "Writing a long book seemed to be too much for me . So , for a long time , I just wrote short articles . One day , inspiration for an article hit me and , as I started writing , paragraphs began flowing out fast . It turned out to be too long to be an article . I thought it would not hurt to try self - publishing a booklet . The first printing of this 32 - page black and white booklet sold out within a week . Here is something that I have learned through my experience . 1 . Start small . Do n ' t try to have a 400 - page work as your first publication . I suggest you publish a booklet under 50 pages to _ your career as an author . 2 . Ask for advice . If you know some people who have published something , ask them for advice and help . You will gain useful information from them and save yourself many problems . 3 . _ When you put your heart into something only to hear \" We ' re not interested \" , you may get hurt . But you must remind yourself that this is quite common . Every \" yes \" you receive comes after at least five \" noes \" , especially at the beginning . You need to revise your book many times to reduce the chances of being turned down . 4 . The more you market , the more you sell . You can publish an excellent book . But if no people know about it , you can not expect many buyers . Send out an e - mail to friends , family and business partners , telling them your book ' s publication date . Ask them to help sell your book . Do not be afraid to try novel ideas .", "questions": "About self - publishing a book , the writer would most probably agree that", "options": {"model": ["self - publishing is the best way to get help", "self - publishing a book is a good way to make a living", "asking advice from people who have published a book is helpful", "writing a long book is a waste of time"], "human": ["one usually makes no money out of self - publishing a book", "one should never self - publish a book longer than 400", "self - publishing a book is impossible for most people", "asking advice from people who have published a book is helpful"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
