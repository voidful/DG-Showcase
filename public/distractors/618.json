{"id": "618", "article": "Known as the \" crazy nest lady \" , Katie Deline - Ray is n ' t quite sure how many mini handmade harbors she ' s knitted for injured baby animals . But she ' s certain it ' s a lot . Deline - Ray is founder of Wildlife Rescue Nests . She designs and makes strong , soft nests , which she donates to wildlife rescue groups to use as little recovery nests for sick and injured animals . She also shares her patterns for others to copy . Deline - Ray began making her nests in 2013 , while she was recovering from a broken hand , and \" spending too much time online . \" One thing led to another - - as happens on the internet - - and she discovered a woman who was making similar nests for U . S . - based wildlife groups , as an alternative to the hard boxes used to contain the animals these groups care for . \" I thought it was such a wonderful idea and went searching to see whether there was anything like it set up for our wildlife rescues in Canada , \" she says . \" To my surprise there was n ' t . So I started contacting wildlife rescues and they agreed to try some out . \" Some modifications were made to already - existing patterns . And then , like a little bird taking its first flight , the nests went out into the world . These days , Deline - Ray sends nests - - always for free - - to 60 - some wildlife rescue groups , where injured birds and rabbits nestle inside the soft spaces while they are recovering . Her future plans include making more nests , organizing new volunteer knitters and helping as many wildlife rescuers as possible take care of their animals in this charming way . \" I have no formal training with wildlife , just a great love for it . \" Deline - Ray says . \" I love making the nests because I have a great admiration for all the amazing work the wildlife rescues do . I feel like I have a part in giving back to wildlife in a small way . \"", "questions": "What can be the best title ?", "options": {"model": ["deline - ray ' s success", "a crazy nest lady", "deline - ray ' s new life", "a great woman"], "human": ["Useful Man - Made Nests .", "A Wildlife Protection Program .", "Birds Need More Rescue Nests .", "A Crazy Nest Lady"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
