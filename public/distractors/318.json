{"id": "318", "article": "Car sharing is another way to drive green that ' s gaining in popularity , especially in urban areas . People who may not drive every day but still want a car to run errands or drive on weekends benefit most from car sharing . Car sharing is usually run by a service like Zipcar , though there are non - profit and informal car sharing services . Members pay a monthly fee and have access to an entire fleet of cars when they need one . The cars are parked in fixed spots around the city , so members only need to make a reservation , and then go to the pickup spot . Car sharing has major environmental benefits because it reduces the number of cars on the road . Members do n ' t drive just because they are in a car . They plan trips , and if they do n ' t need a car , they do n ' t use one . Still , a car is available to them if they need to make a big trip to the grocery store , pick someone up at the airport or if they want to go to the beach for the day . Members also benefit by having access to a car without any of the headaches of ownership . They usually do n ' t have to pay for the gas , insurance or maintenance , and the monthly membership fee is less than a typical car payment . So if you really want to go green but are n ' t ready to totally give up a car yet , car sharing may be the way to go . If you still need to get around , but want to go even greener than sharing a car , share a bus !", "questions": "Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["car sharing is a way to drive a car .", "zipcar provides free car sharing services for free .", "zipcar is the largest company offering car sharing services .", "car sharing is the only way to make a big trip ."], "human": ["Car sharing has become a new trend .", "Car sharing can save you the headaches of ownership .", "Bus sharing is even greener than car sharing .", "Zipcar is the largest company offering car sharing services ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
