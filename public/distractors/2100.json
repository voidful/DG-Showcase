{"id": "2100", "article": "There are two kinds of memory : short - term and long - term . Information in long - term memory can be remembered at a later time when it is needed . The information may be kept for days or weeks . However , information in short - term memory is kept for only a few seconds , usually by repeating the information over and over . The following experiment shows how short - term memory has been studied . Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary . The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students . They represented all levels of ability in English : beginning , intermediate , and native speaking students . To begin , the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English . Following the recording , the subjects took a 15 - question test to see which words they remembered . Each question had four choices . The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording , Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike . For example , weather , whether , wither , and wetter are four words that sound alike . Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning . Method , way , manner , and system would be four words with the same meaning . Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test . Henning found that students with a lower proficiency in English made more of their mistakes on words that sound alike ; students with a higher proficiency made more of their mistakes on words that have the same meaning . Henning ' s results suggest that beginning students hold the sound of words in their short - term memory , and advanced students hold the meaning of words in their short - term memory .", "questions": "The passage centers on", "options": {"model": ["short - term memory", "how long - term memory is used", "how to study short - term memory", "how long - term memory has been studied"], "human": ["memory", "two kinds of memory", "an experiment on student", "short - term memory"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
