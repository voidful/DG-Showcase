{"id": "4694", "article": "Leopards live in many parts of the world , from Siberia to Africa . They have a very beautiful yellow skin with large black spots . They live for about 15 years and eat small mammals such as zebras , monkeys , and antelopes . They sleep for about 12 hours a day . Leopards are very solitary animals . They spend most of their time alone in trees , where they wait until a small animal passes . They jump on the animal and then drag it up into the tree , where they eat it .

The Sinai leopard , for example , from Egypt , is now probably extinct .", "questions": "Which is not true ?", "options": {"model": ["a lot of animals live in europe", "bats usually live for 15 years and eat small animals", "bats usually live for 15 years .", "leopards eat animals and plants"], "human": ["Leopards have beautiful fur", "Leopards sleep 12 hours a day", "The Sinai leopard probably extinct", "Leopards eat animals and plants"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
