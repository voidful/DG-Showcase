Forty years later prefix = st1 / Pariswas the best place to wait in line . However , queuing became popular in Britain too . The Second World War was the golden age of queuing , and people joined any line in the hope that it was a queue for something to buy . This was the source of many Second World War jokes : Shopkeeper to customer : Excuse me , miss , are you pregnant ? Customer : Well , I was n ' t when I joined the queue . Today , according to research inAmerica , we ( inBritain ) can spend up to 5 years of our lives queuing - as compared to twelve months looking for things we have lost . But things may be changing . Many people no longer have the patience to stand in a queue . The law of the jungle has begun to operate at bus stops , with people using their arms to push others out of the way . One way to make life easier is to introduce \" queue management \" . Customers at supermarket cheese counters can now take a ticket with a number which appears on a screen when it is their turn . And while they wait for their number , they can do a bit of shopping . In some booking offices there is also a system telling customers how long they may have to wait before they are served . One of the latest technical progress is the use of an electronic scanner which can read all the contents of your shopping basket or trolley in just a few seconds .
