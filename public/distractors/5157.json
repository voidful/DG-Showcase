{"id": "5157", "article": "One year , my school report made my parents angry . On Christmas Eve , all the presents were stolen , along with our TV . My parents told me that there were no presents because Santa was very angry with my behavior over the past year . The next year on Christmas Eve I slept downstairs with a plastic sword waiting for Santa to make sure that he did n ' t steal the new TV . The next morning , when I woke up , I saw Santa standing there . As soon as I saw that there were no presents , I grabbed my plastic sword and ran at him , shouting angrily : \" THIEF ! THIEF ! \" Jack When I was young , we always had a specific room for the Christmas tree . My mom never really liked the location , so one year she moved the tree into another room . I was convinced that Santa would not know where the tree was and would get lost in our house . I was worried that he would be mad and put me on the \" bad \" list and would not give me any gifts because he could n ' t find the tree . I came up with the idea to make signs leading from the fireplace to the tree . They said things like : \" Tree this way \" or \" Santa , put the gifts over here . \" When my big brother saw them he began to laugh his head off . Lucy Does everyone remember going to the mall and sitting on Santa ' s lap to have his picture taken at Christmas time ? Well , I used to think that if I did that , Santa would get mad bcause he would have to go all around the world and give every kid the chance to have his picture taken with him . Of course his lap would hurt and he would be very fired . I thought he might keep a copy of the picture and that would be how he decided who would be on his naughty list . My mom could n ' t get me onto Santa ' s lap until she made him promise I would n ' t end up on his naughty list .
