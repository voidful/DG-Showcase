{"id": "5299", "article": "Quit while you ' re ahead I am one of those people who are terrible at saying no . I take on too many projects at once , and spend too much of my time doing things I ' d rather not be doing . I get work done , but it ' s not always the best I can do , or the best way I could spend my time . That ' s why my newest goal , both as a professional and a person , is to be a quitter . Being a quitter is n ' t being someone who gives up , who does n ' t see important things through to the end . I aspire to be the opposite of that . The quitter I want to be is someone who gets out when there ' s no value in what he ' s doing , or when that value comes at the expense of something more important . A friend of mine once told me , \" I knew I was an adult when I could stop reading a book , even after getting 500 pages into it . \" Strange though it sounds , we all tend to do this . We get involved in something , realize we do n ' t want to be a part of it , but keep on going . We say \" Well , I ' ve already invested so much time in this , I might as well stick it out . \" I propose the opposite : quit as often as possible , regardless of project status or time invested . If you ' re reading a book , and do n ' t like it , stop reading . Cut your losses , realize that the smartest thing to do is to stop before your losses grow even more , and quit . Instead of reading an entire book you hate , read half of a bad one and half of a good one . Isn ' t that a better use of your time ? Step back for a second . Let ' s learn how to say \" no \" at the beginning , or in the middle , and free up more of our time to do the things we ' d like to be doing , and the things actually worth doing . Saying no is hard , and admitting a mistaken yes is even harder . If we do both , we ' ll start to make sure that we ' re spending our time creating value , rather than increasing our losses . Let ' s be quitters together .", "questions": "The message the author tries to convey is to", "options": {"model": ["learn to say no", "stop doing the things we ' re doing"], "human": ["stop doing many things at once", "learn to say no"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
