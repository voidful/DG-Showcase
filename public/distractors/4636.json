Napoleon Hill wrote , \" whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe , the mind can achieve . \" A young man asked Socrates the secrets to success . Socrates told the young man to meet him near the river the next morning . When they meet , Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river . When the water got up to their necks , Socrates took the young man by surprise and pressed him into the water . The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy stared turning blue . Socrates pulled his head out of the water and the first thing the young man did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air . Socrates asked , \" What did you want the most when you were there ? \" the boy replied . \" Air . \" Socrates said , \" That is the secret to success . When you want success as badly as you wanted the air , then you will get it . There is no other secret . \" A burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishment . Just like a small fire can not give much heat , a weak desire can not produce great results .", "questions": "What do you need to succeed according to this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["a strong desire .", "a burning desire ."], "human": ["Secrets to success", "A burning desire ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
