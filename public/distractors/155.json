{"id": "155", "article": "A new study says that birds living in big cities sing shorter , faster songs that are higher - pitched than those sung by their brothers in the forests . The researchers think that the birds adjust their songs to allow themselves to be heard over the noises of the city , especially the low traffic noise . To study how urban birds song , Hans Slabbekoorn and Ardie den Bore , biologists at the University of Leiden in Netherlands , travelled around Europe and recorded bird songs in ten major cities and in nearby forests . The species they focused on , the great tit , is widespread across Eurasia and one of the few types of birds that _ in big cities . Singing is crucial for males , which use their songs to attract mates and mark out their territory . The changing songs could play a role in eventually causing the city birds and the forest dwellers to evolve into separate species . The findings could also help explain why usually only a few bird species thrive in cities . By contrast , many more bird species tend to be found in forests and other undeveloped habitats . Studies like this could eventually help researchers predict how urbanization will affect birds , using this knowledge could help urban planners design more pleasant city environments , study co - author Slabbe - koorn said . \" You can make a city much more livable if you pay attention to where the noise goes and where the people go , \" he said . \" It would be easy to fit the birds into those models . \" Then cities would n ' t be strictly for the people , but also for the birds .", "questions": "Which is the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["birds change songs to suit urban life", "birds in big cities and birds", "birds in big cities", "birds change music to make a city like"], "human": ["Birds Change Songs to Suit Country Life", "Birds Change Sex to Suit Urban Life", "Birds Change Living Habits to Suit Urban Life", "Birds Change Songs to Suit Urban Life"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
