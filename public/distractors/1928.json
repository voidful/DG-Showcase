{"id": "1928", "article": "When people hear that I ' m the youngest person to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean , they all have the same question : How did a 22 - year old woman row a 19 - foot boat for 70 days through high winds and crashing waves ? Well , the biggest difficulty for me was n ' t physical . By the time I decided to do the ocean row , I had already biked 3 , 300 miles cross - country , run across the Mojave Desert , and swum the 325 - mile length of the Allegheny River . No , the tough part would be mental : How would I handle the loneliness , the boredom of the vast sea ? I set off on January 3 , 2010 . I set my sights on getting past the quarter - way mark , which would take about 20 days . Day 20 , January 22 , was gray and cloudy . _ I was suffering from terrible loneliness . I had n ' t seen landing over two weeks . Every day was beginning to feel the same . Eating , rowing , sleeping , watch the sky , watch the ocean . Then , around sunset , I saw something move on the horizon . They were dolphins ! They circled my boat . Suddenly I felt so grateful . They had come to help me celebrate , just when I needed them . I rowed at full strength for the next 20 minutes with the dolphins around . By the time we went our separate ways , I was no longer lonely . Better yet , I knew I would be okay . I did make it , all 2 , 817 miles . I hit the coast of Guyana , South America , on March 14 , after 70 days and five hours at sea . My ocean row raised $ 70 , 000 for the Blue Planet Run Foundation , which funds drinking water programs around the world . I know some athletes spend the entire journey imagining the end , and that helps them get through . But for me , the secret is to focus on the moment , where you experience the personal growth - - those moments of awareness of being connected to the sun , the weather , and the waves . And , on the best day of my life , those dolphins , which freed myself from terrible loneliness .", "questions": "Which can be the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the way i escape from a lonely person", "the day i stopped being lonely", "the way i escape from difficulties"], "human": ["How to overcome loneliness at sea .", "How to row alone across the Atlantic", "The day I stopped being lonely"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
