{"id": "4437", "article": "Will you trust your friends if you ca n ' t see anything ? If you are falling , do you believe they will catch you and help you stand up ? Our teacher helped us to get the answer . One day , Mr . Morrie came into the classroom and said he had a game for us to try . He divided us into two groups . One student from the first group , stood in front of us with his eyes closed , and then fell backwards . The second group stood behind him . Before he fell on the floor , they should catch him and not let him get hurt . Most of us were uncomfortable with this . We were afraid that they would n ' t catch us and we would hit the floor . So we did n ' t move . We just stood there and laughed in embarrassment . Finally , one student , a thin , quiet , dark - haired girl called Sarah , decided to move . She crossed her arms in front of her body , closed her eyes , and slowly fell backwards . She looked quiet but brave . For a moment , I was sure that she was going to fall on the floor . But before she hit the floor , the other students caught her , held her and finally helped her stand up . \" Whoa ! ! \" We were all surprised , and also encouraged . The girl was happy , too . Seeing this , Morrie smiled and said to the girl , \" When you close your eyes , you ca n ' t see anything . You wo n ' t feel safe . When you are falling , the feeling gets stronger . You are not sure whether you will hit the cold , hard floor or the warm , soft hands of your friends . But if you are brave enough to trust them , they will not let you down . \"", "questions": "What happened to the girl in the end ?", "options": {"model": ["the other students caught her .", "the other students fell onto the floor ."], "human": ["She fell on the ground .", "The other students caught her ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
