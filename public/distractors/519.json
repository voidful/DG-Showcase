{"id": "519", "article": "There are no days when men and women could n ' t associate with each other . When we are asked if boys and girls can associate with each other , most of us will say , \" Yes , of course . Why not ? \" If we want to deal with the association between boys and girls properly , here are some tips for you to follow . 1 ) Keep a normal and healthy state of mind . Our schools and classes are made up of boys and girls . It is very natural for the boys and girls to contact each other and build up the friendship with the students of the other sex . Generally speaking , we should broaden the circle of the association . We should make as many friends as possible . We should have more friends of the other sex instead of one or two . We should contact the students in public , not in secret . 2 ) Contact students of the other sex warmly , generously and sincerely . Do n ' t be too nervous or too shy in contact with a person of the other sex , because no one likes a person who is too shy to say a word . 3 ) Don ' t fall into the ditch of early love . The boys and the girls at adolescence are rich in feelings and full of imagination . They are easy to regard the friendship as a sign of love and fall in love with each other at an early age . In my opinion , early love is a green apple that ca n ' t be eaten . An apple wo n ' t taste sweet until it is fully ripe . Do keep out of early love .", "questions": "Which of the following is NOT true ?", "options": {"model": ["a person who is too shy in contact with a person of the other sex is more active .", "people like a person who keeps silent .", "if we want to be as shy as we are ."], "human": ["We ' d better not make only one or two friends of the other sex .", "Some of the students are too nervous or too shy in contact with a person of the other sex .", "People like a person who keeps silent ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
