Hang on , though , what if I ' ve got the wrong day ? The wrong place ? Have the clocks gone back ? No , damn it , I ' m off home . Whoever I ' m waiting for clearly lives in a different time zone from me . I am always 10 minutes early , so if you ' re 10 minutes late , I ' ve been foot - tapping for 20 minutes .
