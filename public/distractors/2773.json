Even if they ' re just microbes , it will be pretty exciting . \" Obama also said he was impressed by the attention that ' s been paid to flight director Bobak Ferdowsi , the \" Mohawk Guy \" whose star - spangled haircut and warmhearted behavior during Curiosity ' s Aug . 5 landing won him Internet fame . \" I , in the past , thought about getting a Mohawk myself , \" Obama joked . \" But my team keeps on discouraging me . And now that he ' s received marriage proposals and thousands of new Twitter followers , I think I ' m going to go back to my team and see if it makes sense . \" The congratulatory phone call is a tradition for the White House . But it was clear that Obama particularly enjoyed congratulating the scientists and engineers behind the amazingly successful landing of NASA ' s newest Mars exploration . He also said the achievement reflected the American spirit , and he gave his personal promise to protect these critical investments in science and technology . \" This is the kind of thing that inspires kids across the country , \" he said . \" They ' re telling their moms and dads they want to be part of a Mars mission , maybe even the first person to walk on Mars . And that kind of inspiration is the byproduct of work of the sort that you guys have done . \" The Curiosity rover ' s $ 2 . 5 billion mission focuses on studying billions of years ' worth of geology on Mars and determining whether the planet was ever potentially suitable for people to live in . The mission is not specifically designed to explore life , even on the range of microbes , but it could point the way for future life -", "questions": "What can we learn from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["a lot of people are interested in curiosity .", "children showed special interest in the landing of curiosity .", "curiosity rover ' s $ 2 . 5 billion mission is carried out ."], "human": ["Bobak Ferdowsi got a Mohawk haircut to win great Internet fame .", "Obama called on the government and companies to invest in science .", "Children showed special interest in the landing of Curiosity ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
