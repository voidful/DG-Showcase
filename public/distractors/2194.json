{"id": "2194", "article": "Elizabeth ' s Second ! In 60 years , the Queen has never put a foot wrong in public . And for the last 24 of them , it turns out she ' s had a secret weapon - - the nice Ella Slack . The former BBC manager has , unknown to anyone except a handful of key advisers , spent the last quarter of a century acting as the Queen ' s official stand - in at rehearsals for royal events . The 69 - year - old has never accepted a penny for her royal service , considering it \" a pleasure and an honour \" to ensure that everything runs smoothly for the Queen . \" How many people in the world have had a chance to sit in a royal landau or walk onto the dais at Windsor Castle even before the Queen has done so ? \" she said . While Miss Slack may not resemble the Queen facially , she has a similar figure to the Queen , standing just 5 foot . The Queen is 5 foot 2 inch . She began her remarkable role in 1988 , when she was working as manager of the BBC ' s sports and events department . A producer asked her if she could stand in for the Queen to check camera angles at a rehearsal - - and her second career was born . Since then , from the State Opening of Parliament to the 50th anniversary of Victory day , wherever the Queen is on duty Miss Slack is likely to have been there first . She has perfected her own version of the Queen ' s clothes , including a black patent handbag she bought in a charity shop for PS1 , and even styles her hair like the Queen .", "questions": "How did Miss Slack get the job ?", "options": {"model": ["she was invited to have an accidental try .", "she had a chance to sit in a royal landau or walk onto the dais at all ."], "human": ["The Queen invited her to do so .", "She was invited to have an accidental try ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
