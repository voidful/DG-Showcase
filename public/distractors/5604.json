{"id": "5604", "article": "Several years ago I worked in an office , which had a locust tree growing outside the window . It had grown into a tall tree and must have been there for a long time . The tree blocked the view and made the office seem dull , unfortunately this happened to be the room assigned to me and I was depressed by it for quite some time . When the first spring came , everything was green except the locust tree . Secretly , I was very happy because I had thought it had died . One morning when I opened the window for fresh air , I unexpectedly smelt a familiar sweet scent floating into my office but I could n ' t name it . Suddenly , I realized it was the locust tree ! The tree that I thought dead was blossoming in full glory . From then on , I usually came to the office very early to see dew forming on the locust tree blossoms and every year was eager to see spring again . During summer , the green leaves provided shade protecting me from the harsh sunlight , but allowing enough light in to make it pleasant . In autumn , the leaves turned into many different color1s . Its beauty touched my soul . Many times I thought to take photos but never did . Then I had to leave in a hurry . Later in life it became a great regret that I had not done so . Actually , many times in our lives , we think we own something , therefore we do n ' t cherish it . We do n ' t feel regretful until we lose it one day ! Moreover , sometimes , we have to accept the things we do n ' t want and need to discover the hidden beauty to find unexpected joy !", "questions": "At first the author felt depressed because of the following reasons except that", "options": {"model": ["when the first spring came , everything was green except the locust tree", "he could n ' t bear the locust tree growing inside the window", "the locust tree could n ' t be found", "he did n ' t think the locust tree had died"], "human": ["The tree blocked the view", "the tree made the office seem dull", "The office was assigned to him", "When the first spring came , everything was green except the locust tree"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
