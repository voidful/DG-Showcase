{"id": "4824", "article": "Dolphins are not fish . They are mammals . They live in groups and speak to each other in their own language . But they are quite different from almost all land animals . Their brain is as big as men ' s and they live a long life at least 20 or 30 years . Like some animals , dolphins use sounds to help them find their way around . They also use these sounds to talk to each other and to help them find food . They do not use their ears to receive sounds , but use the jaw - - the lower part of the mouth . It is strange that dolphins are friendly to men , and for thousands of years , there are many stories about dolphins and men . In the 19th century , in a dangerous part of the sea near New Zealand , there was a dolphin . The seamen liked him very much and gave him a very good name , Jack . From 1871 to 1903 , Jack met every boat in the area and showed it the way . In 1903 a passenger on a boat with the name of The Penguin shot and hurt Jack . Luckily the dolphin did n ' t die , and after a long time he was well again . He guided the ships through the area for nine more years , but he refused to help the boat of the Penguin . Today , some people still kill dolphins , but many countries in the world now protect them . In these places , people are not allowed to kill them .", "questions": "According to the passage , which of the following is NOT right ?", "options": {"model": ["many animals live in groups .", "dolphins are not animals .", "dolphins usually live in groups .", "dolphins do n ' t live in groups ."], "human": ["Dolphins are not fish .", "Dolphins are kind and friendly to people .", "Dolphins can live a long life .", "Dolphins do n ' t live in groups ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
