{"id": "405", "article": "\" Sleep - disordered breathing \" is a term for a group of conditions that can interfere with nornlal breathing while people sleep . These include snoring , mouth - breathing and sleep apnea . Sleep - disordered breathing can do more than just leave people feeling tired the next day . It can also affect people ' s health . In children the effects can include behavioral and emotional problems . In a new study . 1ed by Karen Bonuck at the Einstein College of Medicine . researchers asked parents about their children ' s breathing from when they were babies up to about age seven . The study finds sleep - disordered breathing is associated with a fifty percent increase in outcomes including hyperactivity , aggressiveness and problems relating to other children . Ms . Bonuck says the more serious the breathing problems , the more serious the behavioral issues were likely to be . Other studies have : linked sleep with children ' s behavior , but this study was extensive enough to : reject other possible causes . How well do you sleep ? A popular belief is that sleep gets worse with age . But . in another new study , those who reported the fewest problems with the quality of their sleep were people in their eighties . Researchers did a telephone survey of American aduhs . Michael Grandner at the University of Pennsylvania medical school says the original goal was to confirm that aging is connected with increased sleep problems . The survey did find an increase during middle age , worse in women than men . But except for that , people reported that their sleep quality improved as they got older . At least they felt it did . Mr . Grandner says . \" Even if sleep among older Americans is actually worse than in younger adults , feelings about it still improve with age . \" In the study , health problems and depression were linked with poor sleep . But , based on the study . Mr . Grandner says older people who are not sick or depressed should be reporting better sleep . \" If they ' re not . they need to talk to their doctor . \" he says . He says heahtlh care providers generally dismiss sleep complaints from older adults as a normal part of aging .", "questions": "The text is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["new findings on sleep in children , older adults", "the effects of sleep on children ' s health", "the effects of sleep - disordered breathing on children", "different types of sleep - disordered breathing"], "human": ["people ' s health problems", "children ' s breathing problems", "older adults ' sleep complaints", "new findings on sleep in children , older adults"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
