{"id": "479", "article": "B Gift Idea The other day I was shopping for Grandma when I realized I had no gift ideas at all . It was not a birthday gift or anything like that . It was simply sort of a hello gift . That is how we do things in my family . We do n ' t really give gifts for special occasions . Instead , we occasionally just give presents to each other to tell other people that we are thinking about them . That was why I wanted a gift for Grandma . But it was like my imagination had dried up . I have gone through all of the gift ideas in previous years , fruits , wines , cheeses , little handmade crafts , and anything else that you can give to a grandmother . I had even given her gift watches , and CDs . What else was there ? I have always found gift ideas for men a little bit easier than for women , because for men , you can always get the usual things , such as video games , power tools and things like that . With a woman ' s gift idea , however , you have to know more about her . You can not just get someone a book or a CD . You have to know all about her taste in movies , music , and literature . My grandmother likes to read a lot , but what she likes is always pretty popular . I did n ' t want to get her a book that she might not like , but I was running out of time . I needed a gift idea for this weekend and went to visit her . After all , I had n ' t seen her for a long time . I wanted to give her a gift so she would not feel ignored . Finally , I came up with the perfect gift idea . I made a collection of all the stories I had written in the past year . It was n ' t a typical gift idea like a bunch of flowers , but it really worked in the situation . You see , I am a writer and my grandma has always been my fan . Anyway , I had been learning about bookbinding recently , and had pretty much mastered the art . I figured that I would add a little bit of handmade artwork to the stories , bind it altogether , and give it to her . It took hours to complete , but it was well worth the effort . She ly loved it .", "questions": "What gift did the writer finally decide to give his grandma ?", "options": {"model": ["stories written by himself .", "stories given by his grandmother ."], "human": ["Gift watches .", "Stories written by himself ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
