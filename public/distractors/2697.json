But a large rise in palm oil production on peat lands is blamed for the many fires this year . Peat is made partly of dead plants , which burns easily and is often used as cooking fuel . The resulting thick , black smoke has polluted skies over Indonesia and four other countries . The burning has worsened air quality , closed schools and caused any outdoor activities to stop . The smoke is not only affecting people ; it is affecting wildlife . In Indonesian Borneo , an animal rescue center says some of its animals have developed breathing problems .
