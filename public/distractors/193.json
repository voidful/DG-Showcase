{"id": "193", "article": "A great French writer says that we should help everyone as much as possible because we often need help ourselves . The small even can help the great . Then he tells a simple story . An ant is drinking at a small stream and falls in . She tries to reach the side but makes no progress at all . The poor ant , almost exhausted , is still doing her best when a bird sees her . Moved with pity the bird throws a blade of grass into the water . It supports the ant like a boat , and the ant reaches the bank . When she is having a rest in the grass , she sees a man walking along barefooted and carrying a gun in his hand . He wants to kill the bird nearby . When he raises his gun to fire , the ant bites him in the foot . So he stops to look down and the bird flies away quickly . It is an animal much weaker and smaller than herself that has saved her life .", "questions": "The ant finally got on the bank", "options": {"model": ["with the help of the bird", "with the help of a piece of grass"], "human": ["when the bird reached out a leg for it", "with the help of a piece of grass"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
