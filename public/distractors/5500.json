{"id": "5500", "article": "It was 11 pm . Donald Lubeck was lying in bed . Outside , lightning lit up the sky , and thunder shook the house . Suddenly he heard the smoke alarm sounding . Lubeck walked down to see what happened ; he opened the door to the kitchen , and flames just went out . The sudden strong wind from the doorway immediately created a large fire from a small one , probably caused by lightning . Lubeck went back to his bedroom to call 911 . \" I felt safe because the room had a separate stairway , \" he explains . The phone did n ' t work , and when Lubeck tried to go down the stairway , he was stopped by a wall of flames . Lubeck realized he was in trouble . His daughter and granddaughters , who lived with him , were away for the night . Up a hill lived Lubeck ' s neighbors , Jeremie Wentworth and his wife . From his house , Wentworth saw the black smoke . He rushed out , and headed towards Lubeck ' s house . He knew Lubeck lived in the house . He dialed 911 . On the phone , the 911 worker warned Wentworth not to enter the house . \" But I told the worker , \" Sorry , but I ' m going in . I can hear Lubeck shouting \" Help me ! \" I ca n ' t let myself do nothing in this situation , \" / he says . \" I went in and shouted , \" Donald , where are you ? \" Then I had to run outside to catch my breath . \" After one more try inside the house , he gave up . Then the wind parted the smoke just enough for him to see Lubeck on the second - floor bedroom . But there was no way to get to him . \" I finally noticed a ladder , \" says Wentworth . He set it against the wall and pulled Lubeck down . Just seconds later the floor fell down . Within the year , Lubeck and his family built a new two - story house at the place . Wentworth and Lubeck do n ' t run into each other often , but Lubeck now knows that if he ever needs help , Wentworth will be there .", "questions": "How did Lubeck get out of the house ?", "options": {"model": ["he climbed down a ladder found by wentworth .", "he opened the door to the kitchen and ran into the fire ."], "human": ["He went down a separate stairway .", "He climbed down a ladder found by Wentworth ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
