{"id": "269", "article": "The British royal family is about to be slimmed down . The queen plans to reduce the number of real royals , as was recently announced . However , there seems little sign of the monarchy disappearing completely . Up till the 17th century , the British king or queen was believed to rule by \" divine right \" , which was the idea that God chose the king or queen to rule and that he or she was therefore above the law . However , this idea ended with the English Revolution , in which King Charles I was imprisoned and then killed in 1649 . So what role does the British royal family have today ? Well , the Queen has important formal duties : as Head of State , the Queen represents the UK on visits abroad and invites other world leaders to visit the UK . As Head of the Armed Forces , only the Queen can declare when the UK is at war or when war is over . The Queen also has constitutional duties : She has to sign many government and Commonwealth documents every day . In addition , the royal family spends a great deal of its time traveling up and down the country in support of different charity projects . But the public in Britain do not believe there should be a royal family . Sometimes , the press and media criticize the royal family as well . One criticism is that British people should not have to pay for the royal family through their taxes . Today , the royal family works hard to be relevant in the modern world . The queen ' s speech on TV is less formal every Christmas , and is now available as a podcast . In 2005 , after graduation from university , Prince William spent time teaching English in Uruguay , the sort of work many young British people do at some time in their lives .", "questions": "Prince William is mentioned in the passage to show that", "options": {"model": ["the royal family is making great contribution to the country", "the royal family is trying to change their image"], "human": ["many young British people do voluntary work", "the royal family is trying to change their image"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
