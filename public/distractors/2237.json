Some people believe that your blood group hides no secrets . It shows the \" real you \" . And the owners of certain blood groups might be particularly good or bad at a certain task . This is the very reason why you could be asked to offer your blood group before being given a job . The new idea was carried out first in Japan and now it has been brought over to other parts of the world . One important business company in Japan is quite special about these needs : \" For our office members , we must have 30 percent of those with group A and 15 percent with AB , 25 percent with B . \" Do you happen to know that if your own blood group is O , you can get things done and sell the goods well ? People with blood group A are thinkers , while those with blood group B are highly creative . And if you have problems , ask the ABs to solve them . So if you visit the Japanese company , you would find the O types out selling goods and A types keeping order in the office .", "questions": "This passage seems to lead you to believe that", "options": {"model": ["your blood group could affect your work", "your blood group could help to solve your problems", "a person with blood group should be given a job"], "human": ["blood types can never change your life", "the idea about blood groups has little scientific basis", "your blood group could affect your work"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
