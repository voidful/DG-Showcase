{"id": "5620", "article": "Engineers should embrace the arts , Sir John O ' Reilly , a fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology , argued in a lecture . About 59 % of engineering companies in the IET ' s 2014 survey feared skill shortages could threaten business . \" There is nothing as creative as engineering , \" Sir John told the reporter . He says science , technology , engineering and mathematics - often known as \" Stem \" subjects , are vital for a modern knowledge economy . But there is a massive shortfall in the number of recruits - with a recent study by the Royal Academy of Engineering saying the UK needs to increase by as much as 50 % the number of Stem graduates it produces . Delivering this year ' s Mountbatten Lecture at the Royal Institution , Sir John argued that engineers should recognise the role of the arts in their work - among other benefits ; this could attract more people into the profession . The lecture , Full Steam Ahead for Growth , advocated a wider adoption - - Steam , or science , technology , engineering , arts and maths . Engineers should embrace the arts as being key to creativity and an important component of innovation , crucial to creating new products and boosting future competitiveness , he argued . \" Engineering and technology is an increasingly diverse and creative field , \" said Sir John . Some university engineering departments already cooperated with art schools to develop understanding , he told the reporter . In particular he mentioned Cranfield University ' s Centre for Creative Competitive Design and Imperial College ' s work with the Royal College of Art . The two sets of people could work well together and more emphasis on the creative side of engineering could improve the success of products , he said . \" Aesthetics is part of it , \" he told the reporter , adding that Apple ' s iPod was not the first digital media player , nor the only one that worked - but it came to dominate the market \" because it was nice to have \" . Sir John said he was not suggesting universities started requiring A - level art from engineering applicants - the key subjects for admission would continue to be maths and the sciences . But an emphasis on creative skills would help \" broaden the pool and attract more people in \" .", "questions": "Which of the following is true according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the iet ' s skills survey raised concerns about the number of recruits to engineering .", "it ' s the first time that scientists have become famous in the world .", "the iet ' s interest in engineering has been encouraged .", "the iet ' s interest in engineering has been influenced by the arts ."], "human": ["More university students should study arts instead of engineering .", "Engineering and technology is increasingly different and unrelated fields .", "Students from some university engineering departments have already transferred to art schools", "The IET ' s skills survey raised concerns about the number of recruits to engineering ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
