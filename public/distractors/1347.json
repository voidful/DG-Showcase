{"id": "1347", "article": "Last year , I was on a plane with my friend , waiting for it to take off . The pilot ' s voice was heard throughout the plane : \" Sorry for the delay , ladies and gentlemen . Our engines do n ' t work . We are going to jump - start them . _ \" That was all he said . \" See what happens ? \" Should n ' t we have had a better plan than that ? At that point . I could only laugh nervously . One woman started crying , \" Oh no ! We are going to crash ! ' ' There were sighs of hopelessness and anxiety , and we had n ' t even taken off yet . The pilot even seemed unhappy . He told us our one engine was working double time , and his plan was to get up in the air and see what happens ! Then we did . We got up in the air , and what happened ? Nothing . We arrived in Norfolk , and no sooner had the wheels touched down than applause burst out as everyone on the airplane breathed a sigh of relief . All too often , people stop trying to achieve their goals just because they do n ' t have a guaranteed result . But success will never be guaranteed . The best thing that you can do is just get up in the air , and see what happens . While I do prefer planning better than \" see what happens \" when it comes to flying , it really is n ' t such a bad idea for life . If your effort is to build a business then get up in the air and see what happens ! Do n ' t give yourself all the reasons why you ca n ' t . Do not wait until you have everything you need . You never will ! If your goal is to start a friendship , say \" Hello \" , get up in the air and see what happens ! The results could be very rewarding . If your goal is to learn a new skill , get up in the air and see what happens ! It might not be as difficult as your think . It could be fun !", "questions": "What can be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["how to avoid avoting in the air", "we will see what happens"], "human": ["Making Plans Is Better Than Taking Chances", "We Will See What Happens"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
