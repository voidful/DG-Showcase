{"id": "1426", "article": "We all have our ways of marking time . As a photographer , my life is measured from one story to the next . My oldest son was born in the middle of a long story about the Endangered Species Act . My daughter came along with a pack of gray wolves . Twenty stories later , though , it ' s the story in Alaska that I ' ll remember best . It was the story about the loss of wilderness - - and the story during which my wife Kathy got cancer . That ' s the one that made time stand still . I stopped taking pictures on the day when she found that tumor . Cruelly , it was Thanksgiving . By Christmas , she had become very weak . Some days she was so sick she could n ' t watch TV . Early examination saves time . But ours was not early . By the time you can feel it yourself , it ' s often bigger than the doctor want it to be . Cancer is a thief . It steals time . Our days are already short with worry . Then comes this terrible disease , unfair as storm at harvest time . But cancer also has the power to change us , for good . We learn to simplify , enjoying what we have instead of feeling sorry for what we do n ' t . Cancer even made me a better father . My work had made me a stranger to my three kids . But now I pay attention to what really matters . This is not a race . This is a new way of life and new way of seeing , all from the cancer . In the end each of us has so little time . We have less of it than we can possibly imagine . And even though it turns out that Kathy ' s cancer has not spread , and her prognosis is good , we try to make it all count now , enjoying every part of every day . I ' ve picked up my camera again . I watch the sky , searching for beautiful light . When winter storms come , Kathy and I gather our children and take the time to catch snowflakes on our tongues . After all , this is good . This is what we ' re living for .", "questions": "Why did the author decide to stop taking pictures ?", "options": {"model": ["to spend more time with his wife .", "to pay more attention to his son ' s story ."], "human": ["To seek a better position .", "To spend more time with his wife ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
