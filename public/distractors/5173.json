{"id": "5173", "article": "It is true that good writers rewrite and rewrite and then rewrite some more . But in order to work up the desire to rewrite , it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage . I am surprised at the number of famous writers I know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers ' opinions . One reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we ' re often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down . Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker suggest that this fact may be a result of how our minds work . Different from popular belief , we do not usually think in the works and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas ( known as ' mentalese ' ) , and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language . But while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of a complex tapestry , writing can only be composed one thread at a time . Therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple . It is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds . When people write as if some strict critics are looking over their shoulder , they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start . Peter Elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem . When writing we should have two different minds . At the first stage , we should see every idea , as well as the words we use to express it , as wonderful and worth putting down . It is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses .", "questions": "What do we learn from the text about those famous writers ?", "options": {"model": ["most of them like reading their own work .", "many of them hate reading their own works .", "most of them are good writers ."], "human": ["They often regret writing poor works .", "Some of them write surprisingly much .", "Many of them hate reading their own works ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
