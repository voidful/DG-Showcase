Let this young man go to him and learn from him for at least three years . \" The man could not believe what the servant said , but he went and found the old man and he was ! For three years he learned from him . Then one day , when he thought he had learned everything , the thought arose in him : \" If I kill this old man , then I will be the greatest archer . \" The old man had gone to cut wood and he was coming back carrying wood on his shoulder . The young man hid behind a tree , waiting to kill him . He shot an arrow . The old man took a small piece of wood and threw it . It struck the arrow and the arrow turned back and wounded the young man very deeply . The old man came , took out the arrow and said . \" I knew that some day or other you were going to do this . That ' s why I have not taught you this secret . There is no need to kill me . My Master is still alive , and I ' m nothing before him . You must be with him for at least thirty years .
