{"id": "4048", "article": "Today is Sarah ' s birthday . She is seventy - five . We asked a few old friends to dinner . Like most elderly people , I suppose , we spent most of the evening talking about old times . Thirty years ago , the village used to be a quiet place . Now it has changed . Every Sunday hundreds of cars pass through the village at what I think a dangerous speed . They make the village almost as noisy as the streets of a large town . As a boy I enjoyed riding on the backs of the farm horses . Things are different now . Today there are very few horses working on the farms . The farm workers today drive tractors , not horses . A man is not of much use on a farm unless he knows all about machines . Now almost every house in the village has a TV set . Is it a good thing for children to spend the evening sitting in front of a TV set ? When I was young I did not waste my time indoors . I would spend the long summer evenings outdoors . I would play with my friends , go fishing or walk by the river . When my grandchildren asked me the reason why I have n ' t bought a TV set , I tell them there are many books I still want to read . I ca n ' t find time for both reading and watching TV .", "questions": "Which is NOT right according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["it is a good time for children to watch tv all evening .", "it is good for children to watch tv all night .", "a tv set is a good thing for children to buy a tv set .", "a tv set is a good thing for children to watch tv ."], "human": ["In the past the village was a quiet place .", "On Sundays many cars pass through the village at a dangerous speed .", "When I was young I did n ' t waste my time indoors .", "It is a good time for children to watch TV all evening ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
