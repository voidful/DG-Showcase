No matter what I did and how hard I tried , in no way could I make my unruly hair to my satisfaction . Growing up in a Russian - Jewish home with parents who thought North American styling products were something illegal such as drugs , I was never allowed to put them in my hair . \" Why buy hair gel ? Your hair is so beautiful naturally . \" my mother would say . The teens at school did not agree . From boys ' not wanting to kiss me when we played spin the bottle in Grade 7 to being called the mop , I suffered from my hair . When I got to university , I believed my hair was a wall that stood between me and everything - - - finding a part - time job , getting a boyfriend , etc . If only I could find a way to manage the curls and put it behind bars , I told myself , I would feel secure and sexy . I tried everything : rollers , hairspray , gels and , at one point , an iron . Then , in my second year , a miracle happened . I was asked to be a hair model for Japanese hair straightening , a process by which the molecules of my curls would be broken and reset in a bone - straight position . I was the perfect candidate , the hairdresser told me . Although they said how hair relaxing could damage the scalp , for the next five years I did n ' t find them to be true . All of the hairdresser ' s promises were fulfilled : With my hair straight and smooth , I was no longer the \" mop \" . However , there was extreme damage done to my wallet . To keep up the straightening cost $ 700 every six months , and that was considered cheap . While some people thought I was crazy , I was willing to do anything to never again feel like that anxious , curly - headed girl in Grade 7 . But when I moved out of my parents ' house at age 26 and rented an apartment , the upkeep of my new image became too costly . I could n ' t hide from my inner Medusa any longer .
