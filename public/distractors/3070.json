{"id": "3070", "article": "Have you ever had the strange feeling that you were being watched ? You turned around and , sure enough , someone was looking right at you ! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them . To research whether such a \" sixth sense \" really exists , Robert Baker , a psychologist at the University of Kentucky , performed two experiments . In the first one , Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes . The subjects were eating , drinking , reading , studying , watching TV , or working at a computer . Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods . Later , when he questioned the subjects , almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them . For the second experiment , Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting . The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they were n ' t . Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they were n ' t . and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed . Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they ' re being stared at . If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments , said baker , \" I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves . \"", "questions": "In the first experiment , the subjects", "options": {"model": ["were asked to answer the questions they had told", "were not told that they would be stared at", "were not asked to be shocked at by the pictures", "were n ' t the same as they had just heard"], "human": ["lost their sense when they were stared at", "were not sure when the would be stared at", "were uncomfortable when they were stared at", "were not told that they would be stared at"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
