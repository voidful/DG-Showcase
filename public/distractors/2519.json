{"id": "2519", "article": "A small , white envelope has peeked through the branches of our Christmas tree for the past 10 years . It has no name , no identification , no inscription . My husband Mike hated Christmas . He hated the overspending and the crazy running around at the last minute for the gifts given in desperation because you could n ' t think of anything else . So one year I searched for something special to give Mike . The inspiration came in an unusual way . Our son Kevin was 12 and was on the school wrestling team . Shortly before Christmas , there was a non - league match against a team of poor kids . They were dressed in ragged sneakers , and presented a sharp contrast to our boys in their golden uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes . As the match began , I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without helmets . Their team obviously could not afford them . We beat them hands down . Mike shook his head sadly . \" I wish just one of them could have won , \" he said . Mike loved kids and enjoyed coaching football and baseball . That ' s when the idea for his present came . That afternoon , I went to a sports store and bought a load of wrestling headgear and shoes . I sent them anonymously to the poor team . On Christmas Eve , I placed a small , white envelope on the tree , the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me . Mike ' s smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year . In the years that followed , I sent a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game , and a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas . The white envelope became the highlight of Christmas . Mike died last year , but on Christmas Eve I still placed an envelope on the tree . The next morning it was joined by three more . Each of our three children had placed a white envelope on the tree for their dad . Mike ' s spirit , like the Christmas spirit , will always be with us . By Nancy W .
