{"id": "676", "article": "The environmental group 350 . org has launched a new campaign called Climate Name Change that proposes to revise to how hurricanes are named : call them after policymakers who say that humans are not to blame for global warming . This will save the Katrinas and Sandys of the world from the injustice of having their names attached to major disaster , the group says . And , as a bonus , it will produce some peculiar weather reports . \" Rick Perry leaves trail of death , \" appears under a broadcast titled \" Rick Perry : The Tragedy . \" \" Michelle Bachman is incredibly dangerous . If you value your life , please seek shelter from Michelle Bachman , \" says an official while addressing a news conference . The campaign is unlikely to influence the World Meteorological Organization , which has since 1954 named Atlantic tropical storms from an official list . But the campaign ' s goal seems less to actually name a hurricane after the speaker of the house , and more to call attention to an issue that this month has reached an alarming level of seriousness . The campaign comes just a month before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release its most recent report on the state of global warming and a week after a draft of the report was given away to Reuters . In the draft , scientists concluded with near certainty - about 95 percent sure - that humans are to blame for the worldwide temperature hikes over the last few decades . That was a revision from the 2007 report , which put scientific certainty that human activities were driving global climate change at about 90 percent . And global warming , the report said , is not slowing down - it , actually , is accelerating . That means that sea levels could balloon upward as much as three feet by the end of the century , if emissions continue at their current pace . Still , as the Washington Post Climate notes , hurricanes are not the best sign of global warming . Though current data suggests that global warming will in the future stir up terrible super storms , there is still not enough evidence to support the idea that climate change strengthens the recent hurricanes that have torn at the US ' s eastern coastline .", "questions": "The draft of the global warming report tells us that", "options": {"model": ["it is the most important cause of global warming", "it is human beings who are to blame for global warming", "it is human beings that are responsible for global warming", "it is human beings that have caused global warming"], "human": ["global warming is speeding up at the same rate", "the new report has a more accurate data than the one in 2007", "human beings are not the only one to blame for global warming", "it is human beings that have caused global warming"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
