Many cities are recognized across the world by their unofficial names . New York is the Big Apple , London is the Big Smoke , and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land . A project has been carried out to make a survey on how the nicknames of some places came about . The University of Winchester ' s Professor Bill Lucas is a patron of the English Project . He explains that unofficial place names often show what people think about a place . \" The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings , \" he says . Basingstoke is a town in central England . The local nickname , Amazingstoke , shows the love that locals seem to have for the area . Swindon , on the other hand , is sometimes called Swindump , showing that some people think it ' s a dump . Stanford Le Hope in Essex is called Stanford No Hope by locals . And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it ' s become known as Padstein . Some people say that the project may have a practical use . Glen Hart , the survey ' s head of research , says the information could be very helpful to the emergency services , for example . \" By having the most complete set of nicknames we could help the emergency services quickly _ the right place as soon as possible , for people usually remember the nicknames of some places instead of their official names . And this will take the helpers less time to reach the places . \" he says .", "questions": "It can be inferred from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["it is easy for some people to get their nicknames", "sometimes nicknames can help save lives", "some local people think it ' s a dump", "nicknames are very popular"], "human": ["every famous place has a nickname", "the town Swindon must be a clean place", "Rick Stein nicknamed Padstow Padstein", "sometimes nicknames can help save lives"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
