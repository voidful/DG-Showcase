{"id": "3271", "article": "People are n ' t walking any more - - - if they can figure out a way to avoid it . . I felt superior about this matter until the other day I took my car to mail a small parcel . The journey is a matter of 281 steps . But I used the car . And I was n ' t in any hurry , either . I had merely become one more victim of a national sickness : motorosis . It is an illness to which I had thought myself immune , for I was bred in the tradition of going to places on my own two legs . At that time , we regarded 25 miles as good day ' s walk and the ability to cover such a distance in ten hours as sign of strength and skill . It did not occur to us that walking was a hardship . And the effect was lasting . When I was 45 years old I raced - and beat - - a teenage football player the 168 steps up the Stature of Liberty . Such enterprises today are regarded by many middle - aged persons as bad for the heart . But a well - known British physician , Sir Adolphe Abrahams , pointed out recently that hearts and bodies need proper exercise . A person who avoids exercise is more likely to have illnesses than one who exercises regularly . And walking is an ideal form of exercise - - - the most familiar and natural of all . It was Henry Thoreau who showed mankind the richness of going on foot . The man walking can learn the trees , flower , insects , birds and animals , the significance of seasons , the very feel of himself as a living creature in a living world . He can not learn in a car . The car is a convenient means of transport , but we have made it our way of life . Many people do n ' t dare to approach Nature any more ; to them the world they were born to enjoy is all threat . To them security is _ r thundering on a concrete road . And much of their thinking takes place while waiting for the traffic light to turn green . I say that the green of forests is the mind ' s best light . And none but the man on foot can evaluate what is basic and everlasting .", "questions": "What was life like when the author was young ?", "options": {"model": ["people often walked around on foot while walking .", "people usually went around on foot .", "people usually enjoyed walking ."], "human": ["people often walked 25 miles a day", "people considered a ten - hour walk as a hardship .", "People usually went around on foot ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
