{"id": "2978", "article": "James Proud , a British businessman who settled in San Francisco launched a Twitter campaign called \" Stop DST \" . Daylight Saving Time ( DST ) refers to the time during the summer when clocks are one hour ahead of standard time . \" Daylight saving was created to save energy , and it does n ' t really do that . \" Proud said , \" but what ' s even worse are its negative health effects . It ' s both outdated and harmful . \" daylight saving has been linked to a surprising number of health issues such as heart attacks , but Proud has a particular interest in the topic because of its disruptive effects on sleep . Last year , German researchers suggested that our body cocks never really adjust t daylight saving , which causes a host of health problems . Till Roenneberg of Ludwig - Maximillians University said that because of DST , \" the majority of the population has severely decreased productivity , decreased quality of life , increasing chance of getting illness , and is just plain tired . \" The week after daylight saving also witnesses a sudden increase in fatal traffic accidents , according to the University of Colorado . It is believed that this is caused both by disrupted sleep schedules and the shift of daylight hours from the morning to the evening . \" Daylight saving is an economic tradition . And all economic choices involve achieving a balance . \" said behavioral economist David Gerard . \" Even if we decide to abolish daylight saving , there would be a large number of unhappy people . \" Some such people are shift works , students and parents of schoolchildren , all of whom get to enjoy an extra hour of daylight after work or class with DST . Plus , restaurants love the extra evening sales DST allows . Daylight saving has also been linked to lower crime rates , due to the \" deterrent effect \" of longer daylight . Basically , more light increase a criminal ' s chances of being seen by witnesses or police , which discourages criminal activity . Gerard also point out that an extra hour of daylight has vastly more influence in the American South , where the sun sets earlier , even in the summer , than in the north . That ' s why residents of southern states may values DST more .", "questions": "What causes Proud ' s greatest concern ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s caused by bad sleep schedule", "it is caused by bad health effects on people ' s health", "dst resulting in disorder in people ' s sleep schedule", "it is caused by bad health effects on people"], "human": ["DST not keeping up with economic development", "DST stopping people from working productively .", "DST not helping to save energy any more", "DST resulting in disorder in people ' s sleep schedule"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
