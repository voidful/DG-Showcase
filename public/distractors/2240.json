In his high school years , he was considered one of top students in the classics , before moving into the arts , sciences , and literature , again picking up high marks and receiving academic praise . It earned him admission to Harvard University . As a rebellious yet relatively quiet student , he created a website called Facemash in the university - an instantly controversial website that encouraged students to rate each other based on appearance . The site was controversial for several reasons . The first was its illegal use of photographs , which the university and students took issue with . The second was its controversial nature - not every student like being ranked based on their appearance . The third was its huge resource use - while it was hosted on Harvard servers , it was the most popular page in the university ' s entire network . Zuckerberg was soon forced to shut the site down , but its popularity and controversy had made him consider its future potential . He soon turned the simple site into a personal one for Harvard students , encouraging them to network with their peers at the college . It was then , together with his two friends , that they launched \" The Facebook \" , which immediately spread to other colleges and grew into a public service that anyone could access in the United States , whether to network with friends and family , or to play games .
