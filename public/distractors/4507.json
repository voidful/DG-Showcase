My family and I were in our 3rd floor apartment building when the earthquake hit . There was a smaller earthquake ( around 4 . 7 ) that happened around 4 am and neither my wife nor I could get back to sleep . When the big earthquake hit , my wife was using her computer while our younger son Norbu ( 18 months old ) was playing in the living room . Tsering , our older son who is 3 years old , was still asleep in the back bedroom of the 3 bedroom apartment we were living in . Norbu flew across the room when the earthquake hit . My wife was also thrown to the ground . Everything in our apartment began to be tossed around , breaking when it hit the walls or floor . I ran to the back bedroom and grabbed Tsering as my wife grabbed Norbu off the floor . Together , we ran to the door . I stopped long enough to grab my shoes , coat and a bit of money . I opened the door and one of our neighbors helped us carry Tsering down to the ground floor . I was the only one of my family who managed to get shoes . After the earthquake , we were able to see that this was a major earthquake . We began to hear people crying for help , badly injured people crawling to the road and people weeping for loved ones who had died .", "questions": "Which is the best title for this article ?", "options": {"model": ["an earthquake", "a major earthquake"], "human": ["What to Do in an Earthquake", "A Major Earthquake"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
