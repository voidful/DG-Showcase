Doctors found that the lungs of the children whose mothers smoked were 8 % less developed than the lungs of the children whose mothers did not smoke , and that the children whose mothers smoked had 25 % more cold and breathing diseases than other children later in life . Another recent study found that children had a greater chance of having lung cancer if their mothers smoked . The study also showed that the danger of cancer increased only for sons and not for daughters , and that the father ' s smoking did not affect a child ' s chance of suffering from lung cancer .", "questions": "Which of the following is the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["mothers , do n ' t smoke", "mothers , children"], "human": ["Lung Cancer", "Mothers , Do n ' t Smoke"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
