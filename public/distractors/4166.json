Some other pests whose colors are different form plants are easily found and eaten by others . So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night . If you study the animals ' life , you ' ll find the main use of colors is to protect themselves . Bears , lions and other animals move quietly through forests . They can not be easily seen by hunters because their colors are much like the trees . Colors are useful not only on the land , but also in the sea .

That is why they live safely though they are not strong at all .", "questions": "Which is the best title for this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["colors of colors", "the main use of colors for animals and pests", "colors and animals"], "human": ["The colors of the seasons", "Animals on the land and in the sea", "The main use of colors for animals and pests"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
