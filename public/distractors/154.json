{"id": "154", "article": "A setting of a story acts as a photographic backdrop to your plot and interacts with the characters . And the following are the elements that make a setting : Time is the starting point of your setting . You develop your story and combine characters with respect to your chosen time period . Likewise , your story could evolve from a specific time of the day . A locale , in other words , is the clothing of your story . This could be just about any place you have heard of or created . What follows your locales is the architecture of the place - - for example , if your character is born in a Victorian - style house then you will need to add in details like color1ed brickwork or a fireplace to go with your character . Atmosphere has got to do with the climatic influences in your story . This could mean the heavy rain , mild wind or big earthquakes . Wrapping your story with weather details is a safe way of lightening the mood of your story . Geography of a place , again , helps to set the tone and mood of your story . It could be mushy lowlands , strange forests , steep mountains , lifeless rivers , dead lakes , a snow - covered house in Switzerland . Your description of the geography is an important element of the setting . Likewise , your geographic setting could also involve imagery of ports , farms , temples , yards , etc . that will interact with your plot and characters . Your cultural setting greatly helps with your character . The social practices , religious beliefs , political situations of a particular time , cultural trends , tradition , history , cuisine , clothing , music , etc . are some of the cultural factors that you can use to lead your characters through a complex plot or to give a direction to the characters to advance the story . The characters you create are affected by these cultural factors as well as act as their guiding factor throughout the story . Senses are extremely vital as they not just add more belief to your story , but also help to bring memories of the reader . Imagine being wakened by the sweet of freshly - cut grass on a summer morning , or sitting by the side of a fireplace while the logs crepitate , or enjoying Belgian chocolate , or watching the rolling golden reflections of water on cave walls , or moving one ' s fingers tenderly through someone ' s thick hair ;", "questions": "What would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["how does a story follow your character ?", "how is the setting a story ?", "what is the setting of a story ?", "how is a set ?"], "human": ["What is essential for a story ?", "How to develop a story ?", "How to appreciate a story ?", "What is the setting of a story ?"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
