{"id": "2776", "article": "Getting too little sleep or not spending enough time in rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep is connected with being overweight among children , according to a new study . For three nights , researchers studied the sleep patterns of 335 young people , aged 7 to 17 . They looked at total sleep time , time spent in REM , time it took to fall asleep . Body - mass index was checked at the start of the study , and 45 persons in the research were overweight , while 49 were at risk of becoming overweight . Compared to normal - weight children , those who were overweight slept about 22 minutes less per night and did n ' t sleep as well as them , which means shorter REM sleep , less eye activity during REM sleep , and a longer wait before the first REM period . After more research , the researchers concluded that one hour less of total sleep was connected a double increased risk of being overweight . One hour less of REM sleep was connected with a three times increased risk . Although the reasons are still being researched , the relationship between short sleep duration and overweight may be the result of behavioral and biological changes , which are caused by sleep loss , wrote Dr . Xianchen Liu of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh and his colleagues . They explained that sleep loss causes changes in hormone levels that may have an effect on hunger , and less sleep also means a person has more waking hours in which to eat . Sleep loss also leads to tiredness the following day , which may lead to less physical activity and fewer calories burned .", "questions": "Which is NOT the reason why sleep loss causes the risk of being overweight ?", "options": {"model": ["it means more hours to work or study , so people have to eat more .", "it means longer rem sleep , less eye activity and less calories burn .", "it means longer rem sleep , less eye activity ."], "human": ["It changes levels of hormone , which may lead to hunger .", "It gives people more time to stay awake , during which they can eat more .", "It means more hours to work or study , so people have to eat more ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
