His parents had big smiles on their faces as they discussed the wonderful new life they would have in this great city . His older sister and brother looked in wonder and excitement at the buildings . Uncle Miguel and Aunt Esperanza thought of the good jobs they would get . Grandmother and Grandfather told him what a lucky boy he was to come to this wonderful city . But Carlos was lonely . The city looked big , cold and dirty to him . They lived in an apartment in Manhattan . There were stores and cinemas close to their home . But Carlos did n ' t want these things . He loved his home in the country in Puerto Rico ; he loved the green fields , the hot sun , and the lovely beaches . He did n ' t want to go to school because it made him think of his friends at home . And he did n ' t want to learn a new language that he could never describe the world as beautifully as his own .
