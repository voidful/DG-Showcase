{"id": "1891", "article": "Cooking is an important skill with an interesting history . Every culture has their own types of foods and methods of cooking . Most cities and towns have local specialties and dishes . Families often have special recipes and meals that nobody else knows how to cook . Food comes in almost as many shapes , sizes , and varieties as people do . And behind every meal and every dish there is a cook . In many cultures , especially in the West , cooking has traditionally been a task more often performed by women than by men . Today , however , it would be foolish to say cooking is only for females . Even though people are becoming busier and busier with their jobs , more and more people are cooking , including men . People cook to relax , to save money , to eat healthier foods , or just to eat tastier foods . This activity has become so popular that in the United States there is a television channel that does nothing but teach you how to cook . The internet has made it easier and easier to get all kinds of recipes . Because of globalization more types of spices and ingredients are available to more people at cheaper prices . This has helped contribute to new types of foods , dishes , and styles of cooking . Simply put , cooking is on the rise . In most places you can survive without knowing how to cook . But in my opinion if you do n ' t know how to cook , you had better know somebody else that can cook , or life just wo n ' t be as enjoyable .", "questions": "Globalization has encouraged more people to cook because :", "options": {"model": ["people are becoming busier with their jobs", "more and more products are available at lower costs"], "human": ["They are richer and can afford cooking supplies", "More and more products are available at lower costs"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
