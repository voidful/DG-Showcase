{"id": "3649", "article": "We must do what we can to protect the plants because plants are very important for living things . Life could not go on if there were no plants . This is because plants can make food from air , water and sunlight . Animals and man can not make food from air , water and sunlight . Animals get their food by eating plants and other animals . Therefore animals and man need plants in order to live . This is why we find that there are so many plants around us . If you look carefully at the plants around you , you will find that there are two kinds of plants : flowering plants and non - flowering plants . Flowering plants can make seeds . The seeds are _ by the fruits . Some fruits have one seed , some have two , three or four , and some have many seeds . But a few fruits have no seeds at all . An example of a fruit without seeds is the banana fruit . Most non - flowering plants do not grow from seeds . They grow from spores . Spores are very small . Some spores are so small and light that they can float in the air . We may say that spores are quite the same as seeds . When these spores are all on wet and shady places , they usually grow into new plants .", "questions": "Plants can make food from", "options": {"model": ["water , sunlight and water", "water , sunlight and air", "plants and other animals ."], "human": ["flower , water and air", "air , water and soil", "water , sunlight and air"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
