{"id": "2758", "article": "Computer people talk a lot about the need for other people to become \" computer - literate \" . But not all experts agree that this is a good idea . One pioneer , in particular , who disagrees is David Tebbutt , the founder of Computertown UK . Although many people see this as a successful attempt to bring people closer to the computer , David does not see _ that way . He says that Computertown UK was formed for just the opposite reason , to bring computers to people and make them \" people - literate \" . David Tebbutt thinks Computertowns are most successful when tied to a computer club but he insists there is an important difference between the two . The clubs are for people who have some computer knowledge already . This frightens away non - experts , who are happier going to Computertowns where there are computers for them to experiment on , with experts to encourage them and answer any questions they have . They are not told what to do . They find out . The computer experts have to learn not to tell people about computers , but have to be able to answer all questions people ask . People do n ' t have to learn computer terms , but the experts have to explain in plain language . The computers are becoming \" people - literate \" .", "questions": "We can infer from the text that \" computer - literate \" means", "options": {"model": ["learning how to use computers", "learning something new from the computer", "understanding the computer and knowing how to use it", "learning how to use the computer"], "human": ["being able to afford a computer", "being able to write computer programs", "working with the computer and finding out the value", "understanding the computer and knowing how to use it"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
