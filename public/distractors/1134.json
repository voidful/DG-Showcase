And she does n ' t look a day over fifty . \" He has been careful not to use the word \" old \" . In a society where youth is so admired , old age is often seen as something sad , something to fight against . Americans prefer not to say \" old \" people . They use the expression \" senior citizens \" . They do not talk about \" old people ' s \" homes , but \" retirement \" homes . In fact , the entertainer is not so wrong . Seventy is not very old these days . People in theprefix = st1 / USare living longer and longer . In1980 , 12 percent of Americans were over sixty - five years old . By 2030 , 21 percent will be over sixty - five . One reason for this is that families are getting smaller . The average couple now has only 1 . 8 children . At the same time , improved medical care means that people are living longer . This change in the age of Americans is going to have serious results . For one thing , medical costs are rising . The government is unable to pay the elderly people ' s medical bills that have gone up very much . Some old people have to leave hospital \" sicker and quicker \" than they should , before they are really better . More fortunate senior citizens , though , who still have good health , want new laws to be passed to allow them to stay at work . In the past , the retirement age was sixty - five , but that is changing now . Older people are stronger and more energetic than ever before . Many of them refuse to stop working just because they have reached a certain age . There is a change , too , in the way in which elderly people see themselves . _ are no longer happy to accept the gray hair , bald heads , and boring clothes of their own parents . They like to wear younger - looking clothes and bright makeup . American women spend millions of dollars a year on operations to lift their faces and make those ugly wrinkles disappear", "questions": "In America people try to avoid using the word \" old \" because", "options": {"model": ["the old age is often seen as something to fight against", "the old age is seen as something that is n ' t admired", "they do n ' t like old people ' s homes", "the old people ca n ' t get rid of the old age"], "human": ["it is now believed to bring bad luck to elderly people", "the standard of getting old has changed", "the change in the age has caused a healthy problem", "the old age is seen as something that is n ' t admired"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
