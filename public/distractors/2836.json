{"id": "2836", "article": "Ice sculpting is a difficult process . First , ice must be carefully selected so that it is suitable for sculpting . Its ideal material is pure , clean water with high clarity . It should also have the minimum ( = least ) number of air bubbles . Perfectly clear ice blocks weighing 140 kg and measuring 100 cmx50 cmx25 cm are available from the Clinebell Company in Colorado . Much larger clear blocks are produced in Europe and Canada or harvested from a frozen river in Sweden . These large ice blocks are used for large ice sculpting events and for building ice hotels . Another difficulty in the process of ice sculpting is time control . The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting . If the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment , then the sculptor must work quickly to finish his piece . The tools used for sculpting also affect when the task can be finished . Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if power tools are used . Ice sculptors also use sharp chisels that are specifically designed for cutting ice . The best ice chisels are made in Japan , a country that , along with China , has a long tradition of magnificent ice sculptures . Ice sculptures are used as decorations in some cuisines , especially in Asia . When holding a dinner party , some large restaurants or hotels will use an ice sculpture to decorate the table . For example , in a wedding banquet it is common to see a pair of ice - sculpted swans that represent the union of the new couple .", "questions": "Why is ice sculpting difficult according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["it is not easy to find the right kind of ice and work environment .", "it is not easy to make ice to make .", "it is too cold to produce ice sculpting in the future ."], "human": ["It is hard to control the size and shape of the ice .", "The right theme for ice sculpting is not easy to find .", "It is not easy to find the right kind of ice and work environment ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
