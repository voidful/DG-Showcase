{"id": "2579", "article": "Several months ago , I attended the opening event for a new children ' s literacy campaign at the Burbank Library in California . The campaign is called Marvel Comics Close - Up , aimed at using comic books to encourage kids to read . Disney and Marvel donated 210 , 000 books to libraries and schools across the country . Stars from Disney XD participated . They read Spider - Man comic books to 70 kids from Boys & Girls Clubs in southern California . The stars included Drake Bell ( Ultimate Spider - Man ) , Dylan Riley Snyder ( Kickin ' It ) , Olivia Holt ( Kickin ' It ) and Cole Jenson ( Crash & Bernstein ) . Drake Bell said that the Marvel reading campaign is aimed at kids who are bored with books , believing comic books are the answer for kids who say they ' d rather play video games . \" Comic books really get you into the story , \" he told TFK ( Time For Kids ) . \" They are not just words or pictures on a page . \" Dylan Riley Snyder knows from his experiences that comic books have the power to inspire kids ' imagination . His mom was a teacher and she used comic books to interest students who thought they were n ' t interested in reading . Dylan attended these classes . He would read the comic books and draw the characters along with the students . \" It was a great way for these kids to start to enjoy reading , \" Dylan said . \" That ' s how I got interested in reading too . Now I can share my love for comic books with others through the Marvel Comics Close - Up program . \" David Levine is the Vice President of Disney XD Worldwide . He said great stories and great characters , like Spider - Man and The Avengers , were key to making reading fun . \" Reading can encourage you to explore new things and take you to all sorts of exciting places , \" he told TFK .", "questions": "What is the main purpose of the Marvel reading campaign ?", "options": {"model": ["to encourage kids to read more books .", "to encourage children to read .", "to encourage kids to learn new books from the burpop library .", "to excite children ' s interest in reading ."], "human": ["To donate books to libraries and schools .", "To encourage students to use the library .", "To introduce some new comic books .", "To excite children ' s interest in reading ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
