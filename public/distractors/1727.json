Part of Yasin ' s studies in Somaliland were spent in a special classroom , lined with rows of computers equipped with webcams and microphones . The 29 - year - old watched videos and took part in live virtual classes at Indiana University as part of her journalism programme at the University of Hargeisa . \" We had discussions and shared any challenges or questions , \" she says . The African Virtual University ( AVU ) , an intergovernmental organization , connected Yasin with Indiana University . The AVU says it has used virtual learning to train 43 , 000 students since its creation in 1997 . Professors use programmes and apps including Skype and WhatsApp to communicate with students , but classes are taught using special software . The AVU is considering plans to make lectures accessible on mobile phones . Like Yasin , many students in sub - Saharan Africa are looking for opportunities to attend university . In 2008 , the region had the lowest university attendance in the world , with just 6 % of secondary school - leavers advancing to higher education , according to the UN ' s Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization . In May , the African Union ( AU ) opened the e - Learning Africa Conference on ICT for development , education and training at its headquarters in Addis Ababa . Rebecca Stromeyer , the founder of e - Learning Africa , says , \" Now it is the time when technology can really help to protect the progress many African countries have made in education . If the right decisions are made now , they will help to achieve long - term economic growth . \" Experts say online learning tools can connect African students to massive open online courses ( Mooc , ) such as Coursera , an education platform that provides free virtual education from some of the world ' s top universities .", "questions": "How did Yasin obtain a bachelor ' s degree from an American University ?", "options": {"model": ["by using the avu .", "by virtual learning provided by the avu ."], "human": ["By her further education at the University of Hargeisa .", "By virtual learning provided by the AVU ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
