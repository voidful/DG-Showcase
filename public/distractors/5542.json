{"id": "5542", "article": "A number of times Rosemary edged closer to Gordon , meaning to take his arm , but he edged away from her . She thought that she had offended him deeply , and that he was disappointed because she had pushed him away . She would have apologized if he had given her half a chance . But as a matter of fact , he was scarcely thinking of this any longer . It was the money business that was troubling him now . And the fact was that he would soon have to confess it . What nonsense it made of all he had said ! Presently she stopped him , and swung him round to face her . \" Gordon , why wo n ' t you speak to me ? \" she said . \" Are you still angry with me for what happened just now ? \" \" No , I was never angry with you . You ' re not to blame . Something else has been worrying me all the way along , I ' ve only eight pence left . I had just enough money for today when we started out , but that dinner bill upset everything . Can you lend me some money ? ' Rosemary was amazed . \" What does it matter if you ' ve only eight pence left ? How can you let yourself be worried by a thing like that ? As though I objected to lending you money , are n ' t I always telling you that I want to pay for myself when we go out together ? ' \" Yes , and you know how I hate you paying . \" \" Oh , how silly you are . \" She said . \" Do you think there ' s anything to be ashamed of in having no money ? \" Gordon ' s face went bright pink . \" Of course there is ! It ' s the only thing in the world there is to be ashamed of . I ca n ' t be a complete human being - - I do n ' t feel a human being - unless I ' ve got money in my pocket . \"", "questions": "It is clear that Gordon had not intended to", "options": {"model": ["accept any money from her", "give the money to the writer"], "human": ["tell her he had a little money left", "accept any money from her"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
