GlobalGirl Media , a nonprofit organization that teaches teenage girls digital storytelling skills , was started by award - winning filmmakers Amie Williams and Meena Nanji in Los Angeles in 2010 . \" By giving girls a voice , you introduce a different story , and change the existing one , \" said Danny Glover , a member of the GlobalGirl Media advisory board . \" When the camera ' s in my hands , I feel like I ca n ' t lose , \" Said Cheyenne Grisez , 14 . \" It makes me happy and I feel like I can do anything . \" On the final day of the summer academy in California , Williams worked with Grisez and Camila Prado , 15 , on a short film about Prado ' s fight against an eating disorder . In the film , Prado bravely interviewed her parents and sister about how she was able to beat her depression and eating disorder . This film and others the girls had made were shown to parents and friends on the last day of the academy , celebrating their hard work . \" It ' s their story , and nobody knows how to tell it better than they do , \" Williams said . \" These girls are from really difficult backgrounds . They feel trapped sometimes . They feel alone . \" Williams said . \" The camera gives them a way to look at their world in a different way and get out of that feeling . ' ' Girls in the program practice their skills and build confidence by going out in the community and interviewing people for the short films . Many of them had no experience , but found they had good storytelling skills . \" I work with these girls . Every day I leave inspired and completely grateful , because I know that . due to the work we ' re doing with them , things will be better , \" said GlobalGirl Media summer academy project director Heather Faison .", "questions": "What do we learn about GlobalGirl Media from the text ?", "options": {"model": ["it is a project that helps girls to learn skills .", "it gives girls digital storytelling skills ."], "human": ["It gets much money from girl students .", "It gives girls digital storytelling skills ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
