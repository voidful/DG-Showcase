Thankfully , a friend of mine was attending Weight Watchers meetings , and I noticed her great progress . Her success _ me to give it a try . I joined Weight Watchers , attended their meetings and started following their Weight - Loss System . I focused on the plan with determination and never missed a weekly meeting ! I discovered that I enjoyed the benefits of having the help and support of others . I also read the weekly online e - newsletter and was inspired by the stories , recipes and information offered there , I also read magazines produced by Weight Watchers , which have great tips and new ideas in each issue . It ' s hard for me to even remember the person I was before my amazing change . I did n ' t walk anywhere and could n ' t wash my car or walk my dog . Today I do these simple tasks without even thinking about them . But the change did n ' t happen overnight . I had to exercise with patience and perseverance . I decided to take it one day at a time and stick with if for good . The \" new me \" is more self - confident and healthier . I love how I feel now . I have more energy and feel like I ' m 25 again .
