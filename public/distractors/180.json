{"id": "180", "article": "The trip to the United State opened my eyes to the fact that there are a lot of similarities as well as differences between American youth and French youth . The first difference is in appearance . Going around in the U . S . , I found that American youth do not really care about their appearance . In the morning , they choose something in their closet and wear it with another thing , often of different colors and styles , without wondering whether their choices make them look strange . The reason behind this is that they do n ' t care what people look like , but are just interested in their ideas . I think it ' s great , but it also causes problems . Since they do n ' t care about their appearance , they do n ' t really care about their weight . Often they get fat without realizing it . There are differences in relationships too . When the American youth fall in love , they do n ' t really think of the future . Also , there are differences in the rules concerning behavior that is allowed . In some _ , the French are more accepting . For example , in America it is generally unacceptable to make physical display of love . Lovers , actually , ca n ' t kiss or hold each other everywhere they want . People think that not showing love in public places is a way to respect others . On the contrary , the French youth can do almost everything they want . As for other types of relationships , there are also big differences . Americans act differently from French people in front of unknown people . When an American girl , for example , arrives in front of people she has never met before , she will talk with them , trying to create a kind of tie between her and this new circle of people . The French girls will just think about rather than really do this kind of thing because they are too shy and lacking in self - confidence . To finish , I noticed that in American classes , when pupils want to say or ask something , they just do it . In general , they do n ' t really care how the others will judge them . In France , it ' s not the same case . If somebody wants to ask something , he / she will think about it before speaking up . I appreciate the freedom in Americans ' behavior , ideas , and ways of expressing themselves .", "questions": "When American youth fall in love with each other , they", "options": {"model": ["wo n ' t care about their body shape", "will rarely display their love in public"], "human": ["will always think about their future", "will rarely display their love in public"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
