But an equally key figure is co - founder Isao Takahata , who has recently made a new feature , The Tale of Princess Kagnya . It is an unforgettable feature with an unusual hand - drawn aesthetic . The title character is a tiny baby girl who appears in a bamboo plant . She is found by a woodcutter , who takes her home and brings her up . He believes the little girl is a princess , and sets about preparing what he regards as a suitable world for her . This original story is the oldest work of fiction in Japan ; every child knows it in its simplified folktale form . \" It is a fascinating story with elements of wonder , humour , and sorrow , ' ' Takahata says , \" but these three elements are scattered about . \" The chief challenge for anyone trying to adapt it is that \" we are completely unable to comprehend what was in the heart of Princess Kaguya . Because of this , despite its being well known , few people consider it interesting . There have been several attempts at making a film out of the story , but they ended up being abandoned . \" He was connected with one of these attempts , but no one paid any attention to his concept . \" Fifty - five years later , I thought my concept was still appealing , and used it as a basis for turning the story into a feature film . \" His concept involves the princess ' s origins , her expectations and her access to \" the full range of human emotions \" . To realize his vision , Takahata says , \" I needed to take the extremely individualistic brushwork and key designs of Osamu Tanabe and Kazuo Oga , two brilliantly talented artists , and have them permeate throughout the film . The two of them drew many pictures , but they were n ' t nearly enough . The most challenging part was to have all the other animation staff copy their styles in a free and easy way . \"", "questions": "From the Takahata version of The Tale of Princess Kaguya , we can expect the following except", "options": {"model": ["a simple way to make a film out of the love of a girl", "an unforgettable characteristics of ancient people in japan", "a forceful animation type featuring fine images and gentle brushwork", "a simple way to make a film with a special image"], "human": ["more details about the Princess ' s origins and expectations", "the distinctive brushwork and key designs from two gifted artists", "a hand - drawn visual effect that brings out a unique sense of beauty", "a forceful animation type featuring fine images and gentle brushwork"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
