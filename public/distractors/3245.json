{"id": "3245", "article": "You do something about twenty times a minute without even thinking about it - - you breathe ! In fact , every day you take about twenty - thousand breaths . The organs of your body that allow you to breathe are called your lungs . You have two of them that work together , located in your chest inside the rib cage . The main purpose of your lungs is to breathe in good air and breathe out bad air . The good air contains oxygen , which your body needs . The bad air is a gas called carbon dioxide , which your body can not use . When you breathe in through your nose or mouth , air travels down the back of your throat . It passes through your voice box and into your trachea , or windpipe . Your trachea is divided into two air passage tubes . One leads to your left lung . The other leads to your right lung . Inside your lungs , oxygen is removed from the air you breathe and pumped into blood cells . Your lungs also get rid of harmful carbon dioxide from these cells . This process takes place inside hundreds of millions of tiny air sacs . Each adult lung is about the size of a football . When they are healthy , your lungs feel a little like a sponge and are pinkish - gray . When lungs are damaged by smoking , they can appear gray or have black spots on them . One disease that is very common in children involves the lungs . It ' s asthma . Asthma narrows the breathing tubes , making it harder to breathe . You probably already know that your lungs are important when you swim . But you may not know this - - your lungs are the only part of your body that can float on water !", "questions": "Where are your lungs ?", "options": {"model": ["inside the rib cage of your chest .", "in the body of your body ."], "human": ["In the organs of your body .", "inside the rib cage of your chest ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
