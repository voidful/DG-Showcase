{"id": "3888", "article": "Many women write to me perplexed about why they ca n ' t form close friendships . They try new approaches , put themselves in all the right places , see therapists , and read relevant selfhelp books . They consider themselves interesting , loyal , kind , and friendworthy people . But for reasons unknown to them , they have a tough time forming intimate relationships . Many admit to not having even one close friend . A recent study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology offers some clues as to how both nature ( personality ) and nurture ( experience ) impact our friendships . Researchers at the University of Virginia and University of Toronto , Mississauga studied more than 7 , 000 American adults between the ages of 20 and 75 over a period of ten years , looking at the number of times these adults moved during childhood . Their study , like prior ones , showed a link between residential mobility and adult wellbeing : The more times participants moved as children , the poorer the quality of their adult social relationships . But digging deeper , the researchers found that personality - - specifically being introverted or extroverted - - could either intensify or buffer the effect of moving to a new town or neighborhood during childhood . The negative impact of more moves during childhood was far greater for introverts compared to extroverts . \" Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to maintain longterm close relationships , \" stated Dr . Shigehiro Oishi , the first author of the study , in a press release from the American Psychological Association , \" This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily . Less outgoing people have a harder time making new friends . \" Families often have to relocate - - across town , across the country , or across the globe . Yet , in many cases , their kids and young adolescents have n ' t yet built up a bank of friendships . So the conventional wisdom is to try to minimize moves for the sake of your child , whenever possible , and to move at the end of the academic year .", "questions": "We can infer from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["children who move to a new town or neighborhood during childhood are more likely to develop their friendships", "moving a lot makes it hard for people to keep longterm close relationships", "there is some way to minimize the impact of moves during childhood on children"], "human": ["we can move when children have made a lot of friends", "the impact of moves will disappear when one reaches adulthood", "there is some way to minimize the impact of moves during childhood on children"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
