Do you agree with Forrest Gump ' s mother that life is \" a box of chocolates \" because \" you never know what you ' re going to get \" ? Or do you prefer the phrase from the 1930 ' s song that \" life is just a bowl of cherries \" ? Though simply stated , each conveys a very different view . A \" box \" implies mystery , because we do n ' t know what is in a closed box . Meanwhile , a \" bowl \" of cherries is completely in view . For many centuries , the metaphor of life that probably burst into most people ' s mind was the one suggested by Shakespeare : \" All of life is a stage . . . \" On that stage , we take seven roles . More recently , psychologist Erik Erikson took up the idea of life as a stage . Erikson regarded development as a \" powerful unfolding \" in which we are driven from one stage to the next as our bodies , minds , and social roles develop . Stage metaphors fit with many of our common - sense ideas about change , but the problem with the stage metaphor is that it is n ' t particularly accurate . None of the studies that try to clarify the universality of adult life stages actually studied people as they developed over time . All of them were based on performances of their samples at one point in time . People ' s actual lives do n ' t fit into these stage metaphors . They do n ' t automatically transform when people reach a certain age . Instead , people ' s real lives are messy , unpredictable , and full of surprises . Today , I ' d like to focus on an even longer study , an 80 - year study which is the subject of a recent book by Howard Friedman and Leslie Martin . Their final chapter summarizes the \" many changes of healthy and unhealthy pathways \" that their participants took over the course of their lives . As I too discovered in my research , the pathway provides a perfect metaphor of human development . We do n ' t all go down the same road marked with the same signposts based on age . People travel through diverse routes as they track the years of adulthood . Friedman and Martin use health and long life as their measure ; I '", "questions": "What does the passage focus on ?", "options": {"model": ["the pathway as a perfect life metaphor .", "the process of life .", "the process of changing our life .", "the process of making our life perfect ."], "human": ["Various views on life metaphors .", "The stage as a common life metaphor .", "Different kinds of life metaphors .", "The pathway as a perfect life metaphor ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
