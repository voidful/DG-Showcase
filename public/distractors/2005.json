Each year my father would dress up as Santa Claus and go through the streets of the projects sharing joy and candies with the children there . He loved it as much as they did ! But around the Christmas in 1970 , my father was out of his job and money was tight . In fact , there was no money for Christmas and my parents were n ' t sure what they ' d provide for us . That Christmas Eve , however , as usual , my father left the house dressed as Santa Claus . He knew that even though our Christmas would be hard , he could not disappoint the other kids in the neighborhood . [ : , , ] As my father left the house and went down the walkway , Santa Claus was walking up , with a great sack full of gifts for us ! He said nothing , only smiled a sweet smile at my father , and wished him a Merry Christmas . The happy man handed Dad the sack and walked away down the block . We never knew who the man was and who showed us great kindness on a snowy Christmas night . We do know , however , that without him we would have had nothing under the tree . His kindness gave my parents hope and showed us in a very real way the true meaning of Christmas . Our family has never forgotten this kind stranger .
