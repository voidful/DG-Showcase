The carrier is just like a small city on the sea . It has all the functions for daily life . There are 4 words to sum up its characters : big , small , much and high . The carrier Liaoning is such a huge one that the total length of the whole corridor could reach over 20 kilometers . But the living space for the sailors is quite small . That ' s because the carrier is designed for researching purposes , rather than comfortable living . Over 1 , 000 sailors , both men and women , are living onboard . They are arranged among over 3 , 000 tiny rooms below the deck . . For visitors , it ' s so easy to get lost . So the first thing the new sailors have to learn is their way around . The number of female sailors is much less than that of the males , taking about 5 percent of the total . But they play a key role in carrying out some special missions . Also , you will be surprised by the high level of education of today ' s sailors . The captain said that over 90 percent of the sailors are college graduates .
