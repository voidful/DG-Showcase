{"id": "2533", "article": "Thank you for trusting me . I enjoy exchanging my ideas with yours The first thing I want to tell you is that if the boys are calling you names it is their fault , not yours . Boys , at your age , are different from girls . They are trying to prove that they are manly and then often do this by picking on someone who ca n ' t really fight back . This is , of course , wrong but it happens . In general , the boys know they are bigger and stronger than you are , so they can make fun of you and make you cry and then laugh about it . If you let them see that they are hurting you , they will only do it more . It is n ' t that they want to hurt you ; they simply want to make themselves feel superior . It ' s stupid , but it is common . In English we say \" sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me . \" Canadian children learn this from their mothers because the same thing that is happening to you in China also happens here . The best ways of getting the boys to stop calling your names is to simply ignore them , knowing that the names ca n ' t hurt you and that the boys are being stupid . If you can laugh at them they will get tired of trying to make you cry and they ' ll give up . It wo n ' t be easy , but , trust me , it will work . There is also something else working in your favor and that is that you are growing up and the boys are beginning to notice you as a young woman . I suspect some of them actually like you and are making fun of you just to get your attention . Again , it ' s stupid but it happens . In reality , you can control this situation by not letting them see you getting hurt . Laugh at them , tell them they ' re acting like children and they should grow up and then walk away with your head held high . One more thing , Nancy . It is very important that you stop hurting yourself . If someone else hurts you , it is bad enough but you should ' t make it worse by then hurting yourself . Even sticking a pen into your finger can cause an infection and give you a lot of trouble and besides , it hurts . The next time you are disturbed by a group of stupid boys , write to me . You and I can talk about anything you", "questions": "The best way for Nancy to stop being called names is to", "options": {"model": ["fight back and ignore them", "get your attention from the boys", "get your attention from them"], "human": ["cry and hurt herself", "stick holes in her fingers", "fight back and ignore them"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
