{"id": "1659", "article": "The nation ' s largest group of pediatricians on Monday urged its members to \" firmly oppose boxing for any child or adolescent . \" In a statement , the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) said thousands of boys and girls take part in the sport in North America , despite risks of serious brain and facial injuries . The group ' s position was approved by some experts . \" There is very little one can do in order to increase the chance of having a healthy brain when you get old , \" said Dr . Hans Forstl , who has studied boxing injuries . \" One of the best things you can do is avoid boxing . \" He said . According to the new statement , published in the journal Pediatrics , information from Canada shows a rise in boxing injuries over the past decade . Pat Russo , a retired police officer who runs a boxing gym in Brooklyn , New York , said injuries are rare in amateur boxing . After 26 years and training thousands of kids , he has seen just one split lip among his students . \" If the gym is run properly , injuries are at an absolute minimum , \" Russo said . \" Football is ten times more dangerous . While tennis or football might also help kids gain confidence , boxing holds a special attraction for children in poor neighborhoods , because it allows them to act tough while in trouble . \" Dr . Robert Cantu , a surgeon at Emerson Hospital in Concord , Massachusetts , said AAP ' s attitude makes sense for upper - class and middle - class kids . \" Clearly boxing is safer today than it was 20 or 30 years ago , but it is still a very risky activity , \" he said . \" For kids in poor areas , however , the situation is different , \" said Cantu . \" The most dangerous thing for the majority of people in boxing is just where they live . They are far safer in the ring , even taking blows to the head , than they are out in the neighborhood . \"", "questions": "What is the text mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["children ' s risk of injury in boxing", "how to deal with physical injuries in boxing .", "ways to fight with boxing", "how to deal with boxing ."], "human": ["The development of boxing gyms", "The disadvantage of doing boxing", "Measures to improve boxing safety", "Children ' s risk of injury in boxing"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
