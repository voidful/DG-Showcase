A boy decided to dig a deep hole behind his house . As he was working , a couple of older boys stopped by to watch . \" What are you doing ? \" asked one of the visitors . \" I want to dig a hole all the way through the earth ! \" the boy answered excitedly . The older boys began to laugh , telling him that digging a hole all the way through the earth was impossible . After a while , the boy picked up a jar . He showed it to the visitors . It was full of all kinds of stones and insects . Then he said calmly and confidently , \" Maybe I ca n ' t finish digging all the way through the earth , but look at what I ' ve found during this period ! \" The boy ' s goal was far too difficult , but it did cause him to go on . And that is what a goal is for - - to cause us to move in the direction we have chosen , in other words , to cause us to keep working ! Not every goal will be fully achieved . Not every job will end up with a success . Not every dream will come true . But when you fall short of your aim , maybe you can say , \" Yes , but look what I ' ve found along the way ! There are so many wonderful things having come into my life because I tried to do something ! \" It is in the digging that life is lived . It is the unexpected joy on the journey that really makes sense .", "questions": "The best title for the text should be", "options": {"model": ["joy in the journey", "a boy and his hole"], "human": ["A Boy Dug a Hole", "Joy in the Journey"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
