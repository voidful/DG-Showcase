{"id": "2146", "article": "You are from a middle - class family , and live in a normal - size home without any showy possessions , but you are surrounded by surprising consumption . This contrast is beginning to bother your 6 - year - old son . You are worried that he will want to live as they do , and wonder if you should move . Sometimes big pocket money , joyful birthday parties , special playrooms and super - big houses tell you that your neighbors probably have more money than you do , and that they ' re not as careful as you are with money , but you may find that they cook and dig in the garden with their children just as often as you do , talk with them as freely and read to them every night . Or you may find that some of these parents stay in one wing of their big house while their child plays by himself , way off in a wing of his own . In that unfortunate case , he is basically growing up alone without being looked after properly , but this can happen to a child who lives in a normal - size house , too , if he has a TV , a computer and a few video games in his room . Even the most caring parent does n ' t walk in and out of it to see what show her child is watching , what Internet site he has found and if he ' s still playing that video game . Too much uncontrolled screen time may lead to a certain loss of innocence , but mostly this child will lose the sense of unity and satisfaction , and if it does n ' t , you might decide to move . Do n ' t judge your neighborhood too harshly , though . There are some things that are right with almost any neighborhood and some things that are wrong with the best of them - - like those super - big houses . The wealth of their owners - - and the way they throw money around - - may make your son feel sorry for himself , unless you help him understand that you and his dad save some of the money , give some to people who do n ' t have enough and use the rest to pay for whatever the family needs . Children want - - should be provided with - - explanations when their parents do n ' t give them what they want .", "questions": "What is the main idea the author aims to express in the text ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s necessary to give some advice to children .", "parents should take care of their children carefully .", "it ' s necessary to give some advice to children ' s parents .", "children need proper guidance from their parents ."], "human": ["Children are unfortunate to have poor parents .", "Children should enjoy their comfortable life .", "Children feel ashamed of themselves in a rich neighborhood .", "Children need proper guidance from their parents ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
