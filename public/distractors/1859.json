During this month , world - class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits . In October , Bermuda hosts two major festivals - - the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts Festival . The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda ' s West End . Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone , Pattie Labelle , and Al Green , and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists . General admission tickets start at $ 60 for on e day or $ 160 for a three - day pass . Starting October 21 , the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America ' s top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings , conferences and cooking competitions . Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco , among others . Three - day festival passes start at $ 649 per person , but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events . Even if you do n ' t attend one of the festivals , there ' s still plenty to do . With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees , the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda ' s two favorite pastimes - - golf and tennis . With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer , you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts . It ' s also still warm enough to enjoy the island ' s pink sand beaches and go swimming , because the water keeps the summer ' s heat longer than the air . Of course , you can always shop in the city of Hamilton ' s upscale small goods arts and crafts shops .", "questions": "According to the text which of the following statements is true ?", "options": {"model": ["cuba is a place where people can enjoy the island ' s sand beaches .", "bermuda is an island controlled by the uk .", "there ' s been a three - day pass on the island ."], "human": ["The two festivals fall on the same period of October .", "Bermuda ' s two major festivals in October are mainly for the British .", "Bermuda is an island controlled by the UK ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
