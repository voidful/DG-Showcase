{"id": "234", "article": "Classical philosophers called humans \" the rational animal \" . Clearly , they never looked closely at ants . A new study suggests that ant colonies avoid irrational decisions that people and other animals often make . Consider the following scenario : You want to buy a house with a big kitchen and a big yard , but there are only two homes on the market - - - one with a big kitchen and a small yard and the other with a small kitchen and a big yard . Studies show you ' d be about 50 % likely to choose either house - - - and either one would be a rational choice . But now , a new home comes on the market , this one with a large kitchen and no yard . This time , studies show , you ' ll make an irrational decision : Even though nothing has changed with the first two houses , you ' ll now favor the house with the big kitchen and small yard over the one with the small kitchen and big yard . Overall , scientists have found , people and other animals will often change their original preferences when presented with a third choice . Not so with ants . These insects also shop for homes but not quite in the way that humans do . Solitary worker ants spread out , looking for two main features : a small entrance and a dark inside . If an ant finds an outstanding hole - - - such as the inside of an acorn or a rock crevice - - - it brings another worker ant to check it out . As more ants like the site , the number of workers in the new hole grows . Once the crowd reaches a critical mass , the ants race back to the old nest and start carrying the queen and larvae to move the entire colony . To test ant rationality , Stephen Pratt , a behavioral ecologist at Arizona State University in Tempe , and a colleague designed a series of possible nests for 26 ant colonies . The duo cut rectangular holes in balsa wood and covered them with glass microscope slides . The researchers then drilled holes of various sizes into the glass slides and slipped plastic light filters under the glass to vary the features ants care about most . At first , the colonies only had two options , A and B . A was dark but had a large opening , whereas B was bright with a small opening . As with humans , the ants preferred both options equally : The researchers found no difference between the number of colonies that picked A versus B .
