Researchers say that hard work at school plus the lack of exposure to outdoor light is damaging the eyes of almost nine out of ten students - - with one in five at serious risk of visual impairment and blindness . The scientists say that young people need up to three hours a day of outdoor light , but many infants are also missing out as they nap during lunch time . Dr .

We ' ve got the massive educational pressures and we ' ve got the construction of a child ' s day in a way that really minimises the amount of time they spend outside in bright light . \" The scientists say that genetic factors , long thought to play a big role in short - sightedness , are not as important as the environment . They point to Singapore as a place with several different racial groups , all of whom are now suffering high levels of short - sightedness . The authors suggest that compulsory time outdoors should be considered by educational authorities across South - East Asia as a way of dealing with the problem .", "questions": "The authors strongly believe that", "options": {"model": ["we ' ve got the construction of a child ' s day in a way that really centrally - sightedness is important", "we should spend enough time outdoors", "we should n ' t spend too much time outside in bright light"], "human": ["infants should not nap during lunch time", "educational authorities are to blame for short - sightedness", "we should spend enough time outdoors"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
