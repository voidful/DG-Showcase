{"id": "349", "article": "Sir Nicholas Winton , rescuer of children , died on July 1st , 2015 , aged 106 . When the letters and the honor came knocking on the door of his house in Maidenhead , and the filmmakers came calling , Nicholas Winton always protested that he was no hero . Heroes faced danger ; he never had . They put their lives on the line ; he had just worked at home in Hampstead , after a day being a stockbroker in the City . They avoided bullets and the secret police ; he wrote letters , made telephone calls , and composed lists . The fact that he had rescued 669 children from Czechoslovakia just as the Nazis invaded did not , in his mind , constitute heroism . He had n ' t gone out there in 1938 with any burning urge to do good ; just for a holiday , in fact . Nor had he gone looking for children to rescue . Instead they and their parents had come to him , as soon as word got round that he might be able to help them leave Prague and get to the West . From 6 . 00 a . m . the knocks would come at the door of his room in the Europa Hotel , and he would open it to find some shivering , starving , desperate figure . When faced with a problem , his instinct was to solve it . So he made lists of the children , took their photographs , got them Home Office entry permits , found them foster families and organised their departure on trains , via the Netherlands , to Liverpool Street . After just three weeks in Prague , he went back to Britain and carried on the work from there . The British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia gave him almost no help , so he took sole charge himself . The Home Office was slow with entry permits , so he copied some illegally . In search of foster - parents for the children he put their photos in Picture Post ; in the hope of farther havens for them he wrote to governors and senators in America and even to President Roosevelt , to no avail . He could have rescued at least 2 , 000 more , he said later , if America had been willing to take any . A hero might have got involved in the stress and distress of individual cases . He avoided that by treating them like a commercial transaction : like the world he knew , in fact . A market was created , takers were sought and any likely bidder would do .", "questions": "Why did Nicholas Winton refuse to regard himself as a hero ?", "options": {"model": ["he did n ' t want to be a hero", "he did n ' t undergo risk in the rescue ."], "human": ["His behavior did n ' t matter in the rescue .", "He did n ' t undergo risk in the rescue ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
