{"id": "322", "article": "People should listen to music for no more than one hour a day to protect their hearing , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) suggests . It says 1 . 1 billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of permanently damaging their hearing by listening to \" too much , too loudly \" . It said audio devices , concerts and bars were causing a \" serious threat \" . WHO figures show 43 million people aged 12 - 35 have hearing loss and the number is increasing . In that age group , the WHO said , half of the people in rich and middle - income countries were exposed to unsafe sound levels from personal audio devices . Meanwhile 40 % were exposed to damaging levels of sound from clubs and bars . The proportion of US teenagers with hearing loss went from 3 . 5 % in 1994 to 5 . 3 % in 2006 . \" What we ' re trying to do is raise awareness of the problem that is not talked about enough , but has the potential to do a lot of damage that can be easily prevented , \" said Dr Etienne Krug , the WHO ' s director for injury prevention . The full report argued : \" While it is important to keep the volume down , limiting the use of personal audio devices to less than one hour a day would do much to reduce noise exposure . \" Dr Krug said : \" That ' s a rough recommendation , it is not by the minute , to give an idea to those spending 10 hours a day listening to an mp3 - player . But even an hour can be too much if the volume is too loud . \"", "questions": "Which of the following ideas would Dr Etienne Krug agree with ?", "options": {"model": ["teenagers should n ' t listen to music for a day .", "teenagers should not listen to music for a long time .", "teenagers who listen to music for less than one hour a day can do much damage .", "safe noise exposure is based on the limitation to both volume and time ."], "human": ["One hour of exposure to loud music a day will do no damage to hearing .", "With proper volume , one can listen to an mp3 - player for 10 hours a day .", "It will be OK to be exposed to loud noise from personal audio devices .", "Safe noise exposure is based on the limitation to both volume and time ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
