{"id": "194", "article": "A great French writer says that we should help everyone as much as possible because we often need help ourselves . The small even can help the great . Then he tells a simple story . An ant is drinking at a small stream and falls in . She tries to reach the side but makes no progress at all . The poor ant , almost exhausted , is still doing her best when a bird sees her . Moved with pity the bird throws a blade of grass into the water . It supports the ant like a boat , and the ant reaches the bank . When she is having a rest in the grass , she sees a man walking along barefooted and carrying a gun in his hand . He wants to kill the bird nearby . When he raises his gun to fire , the ant bites him in the foot . So he stops to look down and the bird flies away quickly . It is an animal much weaker and smaller than herself that has saved her life .", "questions": "The French writer tells the story in order to show", "options": {"model": ["how an ant can help the big", "how an ant saved the bird", "how an ant helps the great", "even the small can help the great"], "human": ["how an ant saved a bird", "how brave the ant was", "how clever the ant was", "even the small can help the great"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
