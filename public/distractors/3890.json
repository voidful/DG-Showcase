{"id": "3890", "article": "In recent years , our parenting culture began to send the message that competence was important for building self - confidence . However , that same parenting culture made a big mistake by telling parents they should tell their children how competent they were . Children ca n ' t be convinced that they are competent . Only your children can build their sense of competence . However , you can do several things to encourage them to develop their own competence . First , you can give them opportunities to gain a sense of competence . You should allow your children to \" get their hands dirty \" in the daily life and find out what they are capable of . These daily experiences allow your children to develop specific competencies that will be helpful to them as they grow up . Also , the more individual competencies children develop , the more they will view themselves as globally competent people . Second , you can be sure that they gain the most value from their experiences . You can direct their focus to the competences that enabled those successes rather than some generic praise of the accomplishment itself . And you can also praise their accomplishments . A great difficulty for parents is allowing their children to be wrong or do something poorly in the mistaken belief that these experiences will hurt their sense of competence . In fact , whether they do it well is n ' t important because success is n ' t really the goal . Instead , the goal is their willingness to keep trying . Another mistake that parents make is that , after being unsuccessful when their children first try something , they try to correct them so they will succeed the next time they try . That ' s not to say that you ca n ' t lend a hand when they are struggling . But let them take the lead ; if they really want your help , they ' ll ask for it .", "questions": "Parents often make a mistake by", "options": {"model": ["telling their children how intelligent they were", "asking their children to do something for their behavior", "telling their children how competent they are"], "human": ["getting their children ' s hands dirty", "putting themselves into children ' s shoes", "telling their children how competent they are"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
