{"id": "2006", "article": "A high school history teacher once told us , \" If you make one close friend in school , you will be most fortunate . A true friend is someone who stays with you for life . \" Experience teaches that he was right . Good friendships are just not easily formed . Why ? One reason is that it is easy to move around in our society . Mr . Darrell Sifford , a news reporter for the Washington Daily , has been studying and talking about friendships for a number of years . He reports what one woman thought about the effect of ease of movement on friendship : \" I was nine , and we ' d just moved from South Carolina to New Jersey , and I did n ' t know anybody . _ and she said to me , ' Amelia , I know you ' re feeling bad because you do n ' t have any friends . But you can fix that . Just walk across the street - - I know there ' s a girl about your age over there - - and knock on the door and ask her to be your friend . ' \" \" As a 9 - year - old , I could do that . I knocked on the door and said , ' Hi , my name is Amelia , and I ' d like for us to be friends . ' And to my surprise , she said that she would like that too - - and we became friends . \" She added that going about it directly always worked when she was a child . But as she left childhood , she found that the simple direct approach was more and more difficult for her to follow . So , as an adult , Amelia longed to have friends but her hands were tied when it came to doing anything about it . The problem , according to her , is that society teaches us in a number of ways that direct action is not an acceptable way of doing things . We need to be less direct so that our feelings will not be hurt if our offer of friendship is refused . Mr . Sifford goes on to describe his own ideas on the subject : \" To most of us , friendship is very important , but we need to have clear in our own minds the kinds of friendships we want . Are they to be very close or kept at arm ' s length ?", "questions": "By saying that \" My mother had a way of getting to the root of things . . . \" the author means that", "options": {"model": ["her mother was able to find the cause of things", "her mother had a way of getting along well with her friends", "her mother could n ' t find the reason why people lost their lives", "her mother was able to make friends with her friends"], "human": ["her mother could always find friends for her", "her mother had a way of making friends with people", "her mother was able to solve difficult problems", "her mother was able to find the cause of things"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
