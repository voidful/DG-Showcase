{"id": "3840", "article": "Life in the Clear Transparent animals let light pass through their bodies the same way light passes through a window . These animals typically live between the surface of the ocean and a depth of about 3 , 300 feet - - as far as most light can reach . Most of them are extremely delicate and can be damaged by a simple touch . Sonke Johnsen , a scientist in biology , says , \" These animals live through their life alone . They never touch anything unless they ' re eating it , or unless something is eating them . \" And they are as clear as glass . How does an animal become see - through ? It ' s trickier than you might think . The objects around you are visible because they interact with light . Light typically travels in a straight line . But some materials slow and scatter light , bouncing it away from its original path . Others absorb light , stopping it _ in its tracks . Both scattering and absorption make an object look different from other objects around it , so you can see it easily . But a transparent object does n ' t absorb or scatter light , at least not very much , Light can pass through it without bending or stopping . That means a transparent object does n ' t look very different from the surrounding air or water . You do n ' t see it - - - - you see the things behind it . To become transparent , an animal needs to keep its body from absorbing or scattering light . Living materials can stop light because they contain pigments that absorb specific colors of light . But a transparent animal does n ' t have pigments , so its tissues wo n ' t absorb light . According to Johnsen , avoiding absorption is actually easy . The real challenge is preventing light from scattering . Animals are built of many different materials - - - - skin , fat , and more - - - - and light moves through each at a different speed . Every time light moves into a material with a new speed , it bends and scatters . Transparent animals use different tricks to fight scattering . Some animals are simply very small or extremely flat . Without much tissue to scatter light , it is easier to be see - - through . Others build a large , clear mass of non - living jelly - lie material and spread themselves over it .
