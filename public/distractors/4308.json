For example , some high school and college students in the United States often spend many hours as volunteers in hospitals , orphanages or homes for the old . They read books to the people in these places , or they just visit them and play games with them or listen to their problems . Other volunteers go and work in the homes of people who are sick or old . They paint , clean up , or repair their houses , do their shopping or mow their lawns . For boys who no longer have fathers there is an organization called Big Brothers . College students and other men take these boys to baseball games or on fishing trips and help them to get to know things that boys usually learn from their fathers . Each city has a number of clubs where boys and girls can go to play games or learn crafts . Some of these clubs show movies or organize short trips to the mountains , beaches , museums or other places of interest . Most of these clubs use a lot of high school and college students as volunteers because they are young enough to remember the problems of younger boys and girls . Volunteers believe that some of the happiest people in the world are those who help to bring happiness to others . ,", "questions": "Volunteers think that", "options": {"model": ["the happiest people in the world are those who help to bring happiness", "they happiest people in the world", "bringing happiness to others makes them the happiest people in the world", "the happiest people in the world are young"], "human": ["they have got to be unhappy in order to make other people happy", "the happiest people in the world are those who make themselves happy", "the happiest people in the world are those who are young and healthy", "bringing happiness to others makes them the happiest people in the world"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
