{"id": "3352", "article": "Sri Lankan police made an appeal for the public to donate their pet dogs to help the fight against terrorism and crime on the war - torn island . \" Make your pet a hero - to detect terrorism and make our motherland Sri Lanka a country with a new facelift , \" the police department said in a public notice carried by the state - run Daily News . It said that donated dogs should be between six months and two years old and must have an impressive pedigree . German Shepherds , Labrador Retrievers , Rottweilers , Dalmatians , Cocker Spaniels and Doberman Pinschers are preferred . Chief Inspector Lal Senavirathne said 25 people donated their pets , but only 18 dogs could be enlisted as the others did not meet the recruitment . He said the dogs would be trained to identify explosives , search for buried mines , sniff down drugs , deal with criminals and even perform tricks for the public . The dogs will retire after serving a maximum period of eight years and will be returned to their original owners . \" We already have 170 dogs deployed in 30 units , including the operational area or conflict areas in the island ' s north and east \" , Senavirathne told AFP by telephone from his headquarters in the central town of Kandy . He said it was the first time they were making a public appeal because of pressure on the police kennels , which usually import about half of their annual requirement . \" This time , we hope to enlist about 50 dogs . They will be given six months extensive training and another six months on the job , \" he said . \" Thereafter they will be officially called Police Dogs . \" Sri Lanka ' s dog population is about 2 . 3 million while it has 19 . 5 million people , and about 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 people are annually treated for homeless dog bites .", "questions": "What did the police mainly want people to do ?", "options": {"model": ["make their pets a hero .", "offer their dogs to be police dogs .", "raise their dogs as pets .", "produce more dogs ."], "human": ["Stop their dogs from biting people .", "Take care not to lost their dogs .", "Give their dogs good training .", "Offer their dogs to be Police Dogs ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
