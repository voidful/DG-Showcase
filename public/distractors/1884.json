{"id": "1884", "article": "An aspirin a day keeps the doctor away . Aspirin has long been praised as a wonder drug and has been in your family since you can remember . Not only does it cure pain , it also lowers the risk of heart attack and stroke . But taking the pills daily may not work for everyone . Although taking an occasional aspirin or two is safe for most adults to use for headaches , body aches or fever , daily use of aspirin can have serious side effects . Up to 60 per cent of us , both healthy people and those being treated for all types of heart disease , may have some level of resistance to aspirin ' s benefits . Aspirin keeps platelets from sticking , lowering the risk of clotting . People who are aspirin - resistant still get pain relief but not the full blood - thinning effects . How do you know whether you ' re resistant ? New blood tests can help your doctor decide whether to give you a different medicine , especially if you ' re at risk or are being treated for heart disease . The tests aren ' t yet widely available , but it doesn ' t hurt to ask . People taking aspirin daily should limit the amount of alcohol they drink because of its additional blood - thinning effects and potential to upset your stomach . Thus you should not have more than one drink if you ' re a woman or two dr / nks a day if you ' re a man . Does daily aspirin treatment differ between men and women ? Recent studies have focused on the effects of aspirin in women , finding that its effects differ between the sexes , and for women , between age groups . All in all , aspirin is still an effective , affordable and simple option for many people at risk of heart attack and stroke . Though it is readily available , always check with your doctor before starting daily aspirin treatment .", "questions": "We can / cam from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["aspirin is beneficial to our health", "aspirin is beneficial to people ' s health", "drinking alcohol could influence the function of aspirin", "aspirin is a common medicine for heart diseases"], "human": ["drinking alcohol will make people feel uncomfortable", "alcohol has much greater effects than aspirin on blood - thinning", "people should not drink any alcohol while taking aspirin daily", "drinking alcohol could influence the function of aspirin"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
