( A formal presentation of young ladies when they reach the age of maturity . This was originally used in the past to introduce young ladies to society so that they could meet a possible marriage partner , so it was for the upper class , the nobility and titled families . At a debutante ball , the expensively - dressed girls stand in a line to be introduced individually . Their fathers then walk them , arm - in - arm around the dance floor , followed by a waltz . ) \" Daddy , you OK ? \" she asks . \" Never better , \" I lie . \" Good , \" she says , hugging my shoulder and giggling .

Both were broken , yet we could afford to replace only one . That ' s how \" upper class \" we are . We ' re more like \" fixer upper class . \" So it ' s a mystery how we ended up at this deb ball .

For the last month , the dads and daughters have all been taking lessons for the Big Waltz , under the direction of the widow of Otto von Bismarck . Fortunately , she is a people person . \" Forward , BACK ! \" she screamed , while teaching us to waltz . Her gentle directions have worked miracles .
