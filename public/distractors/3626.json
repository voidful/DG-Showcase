{"id": "3626", "article": "Whether you live in Seattle or the Sahara desert , the time has come to invest in a good raincoat or umbrella , a new study suggests . As global temperatures continue to rise , more \" extreme rain \" events - - intense , cats - and - dogs downpours - - can be expected , said thestudy , published Monday in the journalNature Climate Change . And that , scientists said , means an increased flood risk , particularly for the world ' s driest areas . The study challenges the idea that global warming is causingdry areas to become drierand wet areas wetter . \" In both wet and dry regions , we see these great increases in heavy precipitation , \" lead author Markus Donat , a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales , told Nature . Donat and his team collected data from 1951 to 2010 on extreme precipitation events from 11 , 000 weather stations around the world , Nature reported . In that time , the number of days with \" extreme precipitation \" increased 1 percent to 2 percent per decade . \" We found a strong relationship between global warming and an increase in rainfall , particularly in areas outside of the tropics , \" Donatsaid in a statement . \" Importantly , this research suggests we will see these extreme rainfall events increases at regional levels in dry areas , not just as an average across the globe , \" Donat added . Peter Stott , a senior climate scientist at Met Office , told Climate Central that the study ' s findings are important , because more violent rainfall and flooding will \" challenge our capability to adaptto a rapidly changing climate . \" As Nature reported , the research aligns witha 2015 study that found global warming has led to a sharp increase in record - breaking precipitation events . Donat told Nature that his study should come as a warning to world governments .", "questions": "Why does Scott think the findings are important ?", "options": {"model": ["they show us the importance of global warming in different areas .", "they remind us to adjust to rapid climate changes .", "they prove that global warming can cause a lot of trouble .", "they show us how to adapt to the changes in climate ."], "human": ["The research aligns with a 2015 study .", "They are about extreme precipitation events .", "The study involves many famous climate scientists .", "They remind us to adjust to rapid climate changes ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
