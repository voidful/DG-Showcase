{"id": "2904", "article": "Kenya is the first country to protect elephants by text messages . Mobile phone SIM cards are inserted in the collars of elephants . The cards will send a text message when the elephants wander too close to farms , allowing wildlife protectors to drive them off rather than shoot them . Hungry elephants cause big problems for farmers and villagers in some parts of Kenya when they are searching for food . Two years ago the Kenyan wildlife service had to unwillingly shoot five elephants who continued to destroy crops . In order to prevent such bad activities , the Elephants charity put a mobile phone SIM card on a huge bull elephant called Kimani . The conservationists then set up a virtual fence . Each time Kimani came near the fence , a text message was sent to farmers . So far he ' s been stopped from going into the danger area fifteen times . The project seems to be working successfully as Kimani has n ' t come near a farm for four months . A similar system has now been put into operation in another part of the country . One of the biggest benefits of the project is that elephants seem to learn from one another , which can help a whole group change their habits . The elephants can also be tracked using Google Earth software . This is also helping the protectors know where to use their resources to protect the animals well .", "questions": "From the passage , we know that", "options": {"model": ["the elephants in kenya have been able to help farmers", "the project has been set up in kenya", "the project has worked out to be a great success in kenya", "the volunteers are not able to feed the elephants in the wild"], "human": ["the text messages are of little help to the wildlife protectors", "a mobile phone SIM card has been put in all the elephants", "the project has been introduced to all parts of the country", "the project has worked out to be a great success in Kenya"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
