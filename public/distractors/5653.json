Afraid to raise the pressure too high , I decided to contribute something that was easy to purchase on the walk to school . Off we went the day of the party , approaching his school as if nothing was planned . I reminded him of our need to make a purchase , entered his favorite shop , and asked him to select the ripest bunch of grapes . He shot me an anxious look and insisted none of his classmates ever be able to notice he had something to bring to the party . My _ of a successful parenting method , resulting in delivering a sociable child to his school , diverted sharply from reality . Back on route , I did my best to hide the sinking feeling of fear . How could I possibly drop him off and then walk into my own classroom to teach a successful class ? My next move was born in the heat of the moment .

I managed to inform his teacher about the grapes in the backpack and be out of the classroom before I could be spied by my son . So , what happened on that June day ? His teacher , a caring educator , worked wonders . My son and I still laugh about the way Mr .
