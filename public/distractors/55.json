{"id": "55", "article": "American culture is unique because it is formed and developed under certain conditions . The major factors contributing to the making of this new nation and the forming of a new culture are the hard environment , ethnic diversity ( ; ) and plural religion , which is quite different from other nations in the world . What is more , these elements are still influencing the American culture . The early immigrants who were English Puritans settled down in northeast part of America from 1607 to 1892 . Frontiers were pushed further west . The frontiersmen looked for a land of rich resources and a land of promise , opportunity and freedom . Actually they looked for a better life . So individualism , self - reliance , and equality of opportunity have perhaps been the values most closely associated with the frontier heritage of America . In history , people from different countries in the world rushed to America three times . They brought their own culture to America and later on , different cultures were mixed together . Thus the unique American culture was formed , a common cultural life with commonly shared values . The fundamental American belief in individual freedom and the fight of individuals to practice their own religion is at the center of religious experience in the United States . The great diversity of ethnic backgrounds has produced religious pluralism ; almost all of the religions of the world are now practiced in the United States . Nowadays , we can see the continual influence of the three elements in the current American society . American family is typically parents and their unmarried children . Middle - aged and elderly people generally do not live with their married children . The people in America have a very strong desire to start a new life in a new place . Quite a number of people change residences every year . The average American moves fourteen times in his lifetime .", "questions": "We can learn from this article that", "options": {"model": ["the american culture is a common cultural life with widely share values", "american culture is a common cultural life in america", "the population of the united states includes a large variety of ethnic groups", "the majority of the people in america are religious"], "human": ["the early immigrants brought about the unique American culture", "people in the world once rushed to America because of its unique culture", "the American family members do n ' t get along well with each other", "the population of the United States includes a large variety of ethnic groups"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
