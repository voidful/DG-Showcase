{"id": "427", "article": "Recently a study , led by Pedro Hallal of the Federal University , suggests that nearly a third of adults , 31 % , are not getting enough exercise . That rates of exercise have declined is hardly a new discovery . Since the beginning of the industrial revolution , technology and economic growth have helped to create a world in which taking exercise is more and more an option rather than a necessity . But only recently have enough good data been collected from enough places to carry out the sort of analysis Dr Hallal and his colleagues have engaged in . There are common themes in different places . Unsurprisingly , people in rich countries are less active than those in poor ones , and old people are less active than young ones . Less obviously , women tend to exercise less than men - - 34 % are inactive , compared with 28 % of men . But there are exceptions . The women of Croatia , Finland , Iraq and Luxembourg , for example , move more than their male countrymen . Malta wins the race for most _ country , with 72 % of adults getting too little exercise , and Swaziland and Saudi Arabia are in close behind , with 69 % . In Bangladesh , just 5 % of adults fail to exercise enough . Surprisingly , six Americans in ten are active enough according to Dr Hallal ' s study , compared with fewer than four in ten British . These high rates of inactivity are worrying . Human beings seem to have evolved to benefit from exercise while deliberately avoiding it whenever they can . In a state of nature it would be impossible to live a life that did not provide enough of it . But that is no longer the case . Actually lack of enough activity these days has nearly the same effect on life span as smoking .", "questions": "What can be the best title for the text ?", "options": {"model": ["reasons for bad exercise", "worldwide lack of enough exercise"], "human": ["Benefits of Taking Exercise", "Worldwide Lack of Enough Exercise"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
