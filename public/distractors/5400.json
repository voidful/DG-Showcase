{"id": "5400", "article": "Baltimore , Maryland September , 16th , 2014 Dear Editor , Ca n ' t your newspaper do something about the habit if hitchhiking ? On a recent car trip Icounted at least 50 people standing beside the road , asking for rides . Many of them were young girls . Do n ' t they understand how dangerous it is to get into a car driven by a stranger ? What do they know about the driver ' s character or ability to drive ? Nothing . Many of the young hitchhikers probably come from good families . Do n ' t their parents teach them anything about the world ? I always teach my children not to talk to strangers . I never allow them to accept rides from people they did n ' t know . Is n ' t there enough crime today without asking for trouble by hitchhiking ?
