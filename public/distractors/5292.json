{"id": "5292", "article": "Last year , I lived in Chile for half a year . I lived with a Chilean family and had the responsibilities of any Chilean teenager . I had good days and bad days I did n ' t understand . Chuquicamata , my host community , is a mining camp . When I arrived there , I was scared . It was so different from what I was used to . There were lots of dogs in the streets , and there was no downtown , few smoothly paved streets , and little to do for entertainment . Rain was not seen very often , earthquakes and windstorms were frequent . I had studied Spanish for two and a half years and was always one of the best students in my class . But in my first week in Chile I was only able to communicate and needed one person to whom I could explain my shock . I could n ' t speak the thoughts in my head and there were so many . Most exchange students experienced this like me . Culture shock presents itself in everything from increased aggression towards the people to lack of appetite . I was required to overcome all difficulties . As time passed , everything changed . I began to forget words in English and to dream in Spanish and love Chilean food . I got used to not depending on expensive things for fun . Fun in Chuquicamata was being with people . And I took math , physics , chemistry , biology , Spanish , art , and philosophy . But the sacrifices were nothing compared to the gain . I learned how to accept and to succeed in another culture . I now have a deeper understanding of both myself and others .", "questions": "The author came to Chile last year with the purpose of", "options": {"model": ["studying spanish for two years", "studying knowledge as an exchange student"], "human": ["studying Chilean culture as a college student", "studying knowledge as an exchange student"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
