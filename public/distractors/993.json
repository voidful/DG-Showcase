{"id": "993", "article": "If we are asked exactly what we were doing a year ago , we might have to say that we could not remember . But if we had kept a book and written in it an account of what we did each day , we should be able to give an answer to the question . It is the same in history . Many things have been forgotten because we do not have any written account of them . Sometimes men did keep a record of the important happenings in their country , but often it was destroyed by fire or in a war . Sometimes there was never any written record at all because the people of that time and place did not know how to write . For example , we know a great deal about the people who lived in china 4 , 000 years ago , because they could write and leave written records for whose who lived after them . But we know almost nothing about the people who lived even 200 years ago in central Africa , because they had not learned go write . Sometimes , of course , even if the people can not write , they may know something of the past . They have heard about it from older people , and often songs and dances and stories have been made about the most important happenings , and those have been sung and acted and told for many generations , for most people are proud to tell what their fathers did in the past . This we may call ' remembered history ' . Some of it has now been written history , because words are much more easily changed when used again and again in speech than when copied in writing . But where there are no written records , such spoken stories are often very helpful .", "questions": "It can be inferred from the passage that we could have learned much more about our past than we do now if our ancestors had", "options": {"model": ["kept a written record of every past event", "written records for the people who lived after them"], "human": ["told exact stories of the most important happenings", "kept a written record of every past event"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
