{"id": "2077", "article": "In today ' s prefix = st1 / Ireland , it seems hard to imagine the grim days of the 19thcentury when so many of the population starved , or that , in those days , many poor people had no clue how to prepare any food other than boil a potato . Nowadays , it is quite possible to eat both well and heartily all over the island . Tourism has made a _ difference to the standards of cooking inIreland . Until recently there was hardly any tradition of eating out in many districts , except perhaps on very few occasions at a local hotel . Patterns of diet were old - styled , based firmly on ' meat and two vegetables ' ( somewhat overcooked ) , potatoes ( of course ) and large quantities of dairy produce . Now things are very different . Tourist demands for predictable , inexpensive fast - food are met , as everywhere , with hamburgers and pizzas - a better bet being fish and chips . But more sophisticated tastes have introduced wholefoods and vegetarian restaurants ( almost unheard of before ) , and a vast number of new restaurants , often French in style , have opened in the main tourist centres . Food ' events ' such as Kinsale ' s Gourmet festival or Galway ' s Oyster Festival attract large numbers of visitors and reflect the new interest in food . Whatever Irish cooking lacks in finesse , it nearly always makes up for in plenty , and ingredients are of a high quality . Home - grown produce includes rich dairy foods , beef , lamb and pork , and a great variety of seafood . One of its great specialities is soda bread . It is made with buttermilk and is served fresh and warm with every meal . Recently there has been a return to simple Irish foods such as stews and potato dishes . One of the best - value meals in Irelandis breakfast . A ' traditional Irish breakfast ' is a plateful of bacon and eggs with soda and potato breads . Accommodation rates are nearly always quoted with a full breakfast included , so you might as well eat enough to keep you going all day and get your money ' s worth !", "questions": "Which of the following statements is true according to the text ?", "options": {"model": ["nowadays french - style restaurants are quite common in tourist centres .", "it is easy to find a variety of seafood in ireland .", "it is easy to create a variety of seafood in irelandis breakfast ."], "human": ["Today most Irish people prefer fast - foods to the traditional Irish cooking .", "Many Irish people are vegetarians and grow their own vegetables .", "Nowadays French - style restaurants are quite common in tourist centres ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
