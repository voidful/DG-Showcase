{"id": "2196", "article": "If a diver surfaces too quickly , he may suffer the bends . Nitrogen dissolved in his blood is suddenly liberated by the reduction of pressure . The consequence , if the bubbles accumulate in a joint , is sharp pain and a bent body - - thus the name . If the bubbles form in his lungs or brain , the consequence can be death . Other air - breathing animals also suffer this decompression sickness if they surface too fast : whales , for example . And so , long ago , did ichthyosaurs . That these ancient sea - animals got the bends can be seen from their bones . If bubbles of nitrogen form inside the bone they can cut off its blood supply . This kills the cells in the bone , and consequently weakens it , sometimes to the point of collapse . Fossil bones that have caved in on themselves are thus a sign that the animal once had the bends . Bruce Rothschild of the University of Kansas knew all this when he began a suty of ichthyosaurs bones to find out how widespread the problem was in the past . What he particularly wanted to investigate was how ichthyosaurs adapted to the problem of decompession over the 150 milllion years . To this end , he and his colleagues traveled the world ' s natural - history museums , looking at hundreds of ichthyosaurs from the Trassic period and from the later Jurassic and Cretaceous periods . When he started , he assumed that signs of the bends would be rarer in younger fossils , reflecting their gradual evolution of measures to deal with decompression . Instead , he was astonished to discover the opposite . More than 15 % of Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs had suffered the bends before the died , but not a single Trassic specimen showed evidence of that sort of injury . If ichthyosaurs did evolve an anti - decompression means , they clearly did so quickly - - and , most strangly , they lost it afterwards . But that is not what Dr Rothchild thinks happened . He suspects it was evolution in other animals that caused the change . Whales that suffer the bends often do so because they have sufaced to escape a predator such as a large shark", "questions": "The purpose of Rothchild ' s study is to see", "options": {"model": ["how iezhyosals were formed", "why igelhyosators can deal with decommeries", "how ichthyosaurs adapted to decompression", "how ierthyosaur and decomprefixion change the way animals live"], "human": ["how often ichthyosaurs caught the bends", "why ichthyosaurs bent their bodies", "when ichthyosaurs broke their bones", "how ichthyosaurs adapted to decompression"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
