{"id": "836", "article": "Although new laws have been passed in some American states to cut down on distracted driving , many accidents and deaths were still related with it , especially using cell phones while driving . Recently the Obama administration is considering disabling cell phones in cars , aiming to out down cell - phone - related road deaths . Transportation Secretaryy Ray LaHood , the nation ' s anti - distracted - driving supporter , said in an interview on November 18 that federal officials are looking at technology to disable cell phones inside cars . \" I think it will be done , \" LaHood said . \" I think the technology is there and 1 think you ' re going to see the technology become adaptable in automobiles to disable these cell phones . We need to do a lot more if we were going to save lives . \" Also on Thursday , the transportation government started a new \" Faces of Distracted Driving \" video campaign that features people who have been killed or lost their loved ones because of inattentive drivers . The video features heartbreaking stories of children killed in crashes because of phoning or text messaging , and new videos are expected to be added every few weeks . A driver is four times more likely to crash while using a mobile phone . More than 5 , 500 people were killed last year by distracted drivers , and another 500 , 000 were injured . LaHood has said it is never safe to talk on a cell phone while driving , hands - free or not , because it can really cause distraction . Incidentally , a lot of people seem to agree with this viewpoint - - a new research shows nearly two - thirds of Americans support a national ban on the use of cell phones while driving , even if the driver is using a hands - free device . But the research did n ' t ask how people feel about government - issued mobile phone scramblers or other disabling devices .", "questions": "We can learn from the text that Ray LaHood", "options": {"model": ["thinks highly of the use of the technology", "is strongly for the use of the technology in cars", "thinks it ' s necessary to use the technology in cars"], "human": ["thinks it ' s easy and practical to invent the technology", "thinks it ' s unnecessary to use cell phone while driving", "is strongly for the use of the technology in cars"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
