I am not going to pay this bill . Last month I bought a table and four chairs for $ 65 . 50 . They were sent to me on December 18 . That night one leg of the table broke while my wife was putting our dinner on it . It fell on one of the chair , and that broke , too . Our $ 2 . 50 steak landed on the floor , and the dog ate it . I spoke to the salesmen who had sold me the table and the chairs . He told me to write you a letter . I wrote you on December 20 , saying that I was not going to pay for the furniture . On December 21 some men came and took it back to the store . Please do something about your records . I do not want to receive another bill for the furniture which I returned .
