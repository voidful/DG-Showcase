{"id": "4616", "article": "A group of old classmates , who have succeeded in their work , got together to visit their old university professor . The conversation soon turned to complaining about the stress in work and life . Offering his guests coffee , the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and many cups - china , plastic and glass , some plain looking , some expensive and some lovely . The professor told them to help themselves to the coffee . When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand , the professor said , \" Can you notice all the nice looking expensive cups were taken , leaving behind the plain and cheap ones ? While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves , that is the source of your problems and stress . \" \" What all of you really wanted was coffee , not the cup , but you went for the best cups and were eyeing each other ' s cups . \" \" Now think about this : life is the coffee , and the jobs , money and position in society are the cups . They are just tools to hold and contain life , and do not change the quality of life . Sometimes , by concentrating only on the cups , we fail to enjoy the coffee . So do n ' t let the cups drive you , enjoy the coffee instead . \"", "questions": "What cups did the old professor give to his students ?", "options": {"model": ["cups which are different in quality .", "cups which are different in price , material and appearance .", "cups which are too expensive to hold and contain life ."], "human": ["All china cups .", "Beautiful cups .", "Cups which are different in price , material and appearance ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
