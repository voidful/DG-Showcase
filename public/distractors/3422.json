{"id": "3422", "article": "Driving to the airport in the early morning , I felt excited . Although I was heading abroad for my first time alone , I felt cheerful and enthusiastic . I was spending the summer in Paris . While looking for more interesting things to do besides sleeping and eating , I found programs for learning languages abroad , and jumped at the chance to study French in this city known for its art , fashion , food , and culture . As I arrived at the airport where I would leave my family , I still felt only great happiness . I excitedly made my way through security , leaving my loved ones behind . My connecting flight was in Frankfurt , Germany , 14hours from Denver . Sitting in a crowded plane watching bad movies could n ' t dampen my excitement . When the woman next to me asked me where I was going , I happily answered and was pleased to note a tone of jealousy in her response . But when I arrived in Frankfurt , fear and anxiety began to set in . Being in an enormous , busy building in a country where I could n ' t speak the language was frightening , but as I found my way , I gained confidence . When I boarded the second plane and discovered that the flight was less than an hour , I was filled with excitement as I thought of how I would manage in a country with a new language . When I stepped on the ground of Pairs for the first time , I was extremely happy and excited . I gathered my bags and joined the crowd of people waiting for friends and family . I quickly had my first experience trying to communicate in a language that I had only practiced in school . As I left the airport , I looked for familiar monuments I had read about , but the landscape looked very ordinary . Then , with one sharp turn , the Eiffel Tower came into view , and I was finally in Pairs .", "questions": "What is the passage mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["the writer ' s happy life in paris on her first trip .", "the writer ' s excitement and happiness on her journey to paris ."], "human": ["The writer ' s expectation for French art , fashion , food and culture .", "The writer ' s excitement and happiness on her journey to Paris ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
