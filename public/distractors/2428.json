{"id": "2428", "article": "In the past , if a person wanted to see the national treasures of a country , one had to go there in person . Therefore , very few people were able to enjoy some of history ' s most important and interesting artifacts . This has changed with an increase in the number of traveling museum exhibitions . King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen , popularly known as \" King Tut \" , toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979 . The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum - goers . The second touring exhibit was started in 2007 , this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities . However some objects , like the king ' s golden face mask , are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances , so \" replicas \" ( exact copies of something ) are on show . Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia , in Charlottesville , Virginia , has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900 , a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences . Before this point , Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders . These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization . The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints , which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more . Face - to - face with \" Lucy \" One of the world ' s most famous archaeological finds in history are the 3 . 2 million - year - old bones of a 106 - centimeter - tall female found in the Ethiopian desert in 1974 . Lucy , a name given to her by the discovery team , is a \" hominid \" , or a creature that scientists believe is the earliest ancestor of modern human beings . Rarely is an artifact this valuable allowed to travel widely , but Lucy has been taken to several museums in the U . S . while a detailed replica remains at the Ethiopian Natural History Museum .", "questions": "What do we learn about King Tutankhamen ' s artifacts ?", "options": {"model": ["only a few people took part in the study of king tutanchat .", "the second touring exhibit showed more artifacts than the first one .", "only a few people had to go to the museum in 2007 .", "only a few people took part in the museum ."], "human": ["The artifacts were shown in London first .", "The artifacts were on show in the United States once .", "The king ' s golden face mask was also shown in the traveling exhibitions .", "The second touring exhibit showed more artifacts than the first one ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
