{"id": "917", "article": "The phone ID flashed , \" Emergency Vet \" . \" Oh no \" I whispered . I could not lose Merlin now . Ron and I had tried to have children for a long time with depressing results . I threw myself into my work . Any maternal feelings I had were spent on Merlin . I could n ' t wait to get home from work each night . I wanted to pick up that warm bundle of loving fur and nestle him . I wanted to sing \" Rock - a - bye Merlin \" , as I did every night as he would put his paws around my neck . Merlin was my comfort especially at times when I wondered if God was listening .

My job at the law firm was so demanding and stressful that I could n ' t imagine getting through the day without Merlin waiting to greet me at home . I dialed the vet ' s number . I asked for my husband but he already left . Then I took a breath and asked the question that no one wants to ask , \" Is my Merlin still alive ? \" The nurse said \" yes . \" Ron came home and said that Merlin had almost no red blood cells left .

Ron said if Merlin was still alive the next morning then he would take me to the vet . _ Merlin had survived the night . After driving to the vet , I went into the examining room . The nurse brought Merlin and placed him on an examining table on his side . His eyes were tightly shut . I thought he died already . I carefully edged my hand to reach his body . His body felt warm , but when I spoke his name there was no response .
