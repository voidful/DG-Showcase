{"id": "2746", "article": "My grandfather was a teacher . He was the headmaster of a school for boys between thirteen and eighteen . I know that he was a kind and gentle man at heart , because when I was young , he gave me presents , and seated me on his knee , and told me stories . But I believe the boys at his school were afraid of him . At school , when he walked into a room full of noisy boys , there was silence at once . When he looked at a boy with a certain look in his eyes , the boy went red in the face , and looked down at his shoes . If a boy brought him poor , careless work that was not the best the boy could do , my grandfather would pick up the boy ' s book and throw it across the room , shouting , \" Do it all again , and bring it back to me in the morning ! \" If the boy was late , or if he forgot to bring the work , he had to do it again , and again , and yet again . My grandfather never forgot . He was a very different man at school from the man I saw day by day in his own home .", "questions": "He was a different man at home because that", "options": {"model": ["he did n ' t get angry at school", "he did n ' t get angry at home like he did at school"], "human": ["he did n ' t throw books about at school like he did at home", "he did n ' t get angry at home like he did at school"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
