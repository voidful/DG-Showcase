{"id": "1559", "article": "From Monday 5 October shoppers in England will face a charge of at least 5 pounds for some of the carrier bags they use to take home their purchases . The move follows the introduction of similar charges in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . The charge applies to \" single - use \" bags - - the thin plastic ones you typically get in the supermarket . The legislation says that for the charge to apply the bag must be unused , plastic , have handles and be 70 microns thick or less . Bags for life are thicker and larger , so retailers do not have to charge for them . However , whether you get charged also depends on what gets put in the bag . Shops do n ' t have to charge for bags used for unwrapped food , raw meat and fish , prescription medicines , uncovered knives , seeds , bulbs and flowers , or live fish . However , if other items are put in the same bag , the charge kicks in . The government is hoping to persuade shoppers to reuse bags rather than take new single - use plastic bags home from each shopping trip . In 2014 , more than 7 . 6 billion bags were given out by the major supermarkets in England - - the equivalent of around 140 bags per person . The bags take a long time to degrade , cause litter and are dangerous to wildlife . By introducing a charge , the government hopes to reduce the number of these bags used in supermarkets by up to 80 % . Will all shops charge ? They do not have to . The legislation applies to all types of shop - - from clothes shops to grocers , but only to retailers with 250 or more employees . However , some smaller shops have indicated that they will introduce a charge at the same time . Shops in airports and retailers selling on trains , aeroplanes or ships also do not have to charge . Retailers have been told to charge at least 5 pounds for single - use bags . It looks like the major grocers will go for 5 pounds on the nose . The charge of self - service machines will still apply . You will be asked how many bags you have used , and charged accordingly . What will happen to the money ? Retailers are expected to give the money to good causes , but it is up to them to decide . They must report what they do to the government , which will publish the details each year .
