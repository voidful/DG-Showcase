To try to replicate something that is so poorly understood may therefore seem like pride . But you have to start somewhere , and International Business Machines ( IBM ) and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) , in Switzerland , propose to start by replicating \" in silico \" , one of the brain ' s building blocks . In a partnership announced , the two organizations said they would be working together to build a simulation of a structure known as a neo - cortical column on a type of IBM supercomputer that is currently used to study the molecular functioning of genes . If that works , they plan to use more powerful computers to link such simulated columns together into something that mimics a brain . In a real brain , a neo - cortical column is a cylindrical element about a third of a millimeter in diameter and three millimeters long . It is these columns , arranged side by side like the cells of a honeycomb , which make up the famous \" grey matter \" that has become shorthand for human intelligence . The Blue Gene / L supercomputer that will be used for the simulation consists of enough independent processors for each to be programmed to mimic an individual nerve cell in a column . The EPFL ' s contribution to the Blue Brain Project will be to create a digital description of how the columns behave . The database from its Brain Mind Institute will provide the raw material for the simulation . Biologists and computer scientists will then connect the artificial nerve cells up in a way that mimics nature . They will do so by assigning electrical properties to them , and telling them how to communicate with each other and how they should modify their connections with one another depending on their activity . That will be no mean feat . Even a single nerve cell is complicated , not least because each one has about 10 , 000 connections with others . And nerve cells come in great variety - - relying , for example , on different chemical transmitters to carry messages across those connections . Eventually , however , a digital representation of an entire column Should occur .
