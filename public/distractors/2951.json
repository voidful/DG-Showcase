{"id": "2951", "article": "New findings show that musical training affects the structure and function of different brain areas , how those areas communicate during the creation of music , and how the brain interprets and combines sensory information . The findings were presented at Neuroscience 2013 , the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience and the world ' s largest source of emerging news about brain science and health . These views suggest potential new roles for musical training including training plasticity in the brain , offering an alternative tool in education , and treating a range of learning disabilities . Today ' s new findings show that long - term high level musical training has a broader effect . Researchers found that musicians have a better ability to combine sensory information from hearing , touch , and sight . The age at which musical training begins influenced brain structure and its function . Beginning training before the age of seven has the greatest effect . Even older adults who took music lessons as children but have n ' t actively played an instrument in decades have a faster brain response to a speech sound than those who never played an instrument , according to a study appearing November 6 in the Journal of Neuroscience . The finding suggests early musical training has a lasting , positive effect on how the brain deals with sound . \" Playing a musical instrument is a multi - sensory and motive experience that creates emotions and movements - - from finger tapping to dancing - - and engages pleasure and reward systems in the brain . It has the potential to affect brain function and structure when done over a long period of time , \" said Gottfried Schlaug , MD , PhD , of Harvard Medical School , press conference speaker , also an expert on music . \" As today ' s findings show , musical training brings about new processes within the brain , at different stages of life , and with a range of effects on creativity , cognition , and learning , \" he added .", "questions": "The best title of the passage should be", "options": {"model": ["the importance of musical training", "natural brain influence influences", "the importance of music in brain learning", "musical training affects brain structure and its function"], "human": ["Older People and Musical Training", "Long - term High Level Musical Training", "Brain Interprets and Combines Sensory Information", "Musical Training Affects Brain Structure and Its Function"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
