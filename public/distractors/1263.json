{"id": "1263", "article": "Next year marks the 150thanniversary of when large numbers of Chinese started working on a huge project in the United States . They help to build America ' s first transcontinental railroad between 1863 and 1869 , connecting the East Coast with the West . People know little about the Chinese railroad workers and what happened to them after the project was finished . Stanford University in California wants to learn more about the lives of these men by reaching out to their families . Bill Yee ' s ancestors came from southern China . He said , \" My great - great - grandfather came to America during the ' gold rush ' days and he returned to China as a wealthy man . And then my great - grandfather came to work on the railroad and died there . \" But that did not stop his grandfather from coming to the US on false papers . He operated a laundry . Bill Yee ' s father continued to run the business and has never returned to China . \" Things were pretty bad in some parts of China in the 1860 ' s . They came to America at all costs in order that they no longer had to bear hunger , \" Bill Yee said . Shelley Fisher Fishkin is helping to direct the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project at Stanford University . She said , \" Many of the Chinese workers who came to work on the transcontinental and other railroads returned to China after their work was done and created families there . Some of them settled in America and created new families , but they had families who they left when they came here and they may have descendants in China . \" There is a need to create a record of the object and spoken history from the families of the railroad workers . \" The US could not have become the modern industrial nation without the railroads . And the railroads would not have come together without the work of these Chinese workers , \" said Shelley Fisher Fishkin .", "questions": "Why did Stanford University carry out the project ?", "options": {"model": ["because they want americans to know more about the chinese railroad workers .", "because they want americans to remember the chinese railroad workers ' role in us history .", "because they want to learn more about the lives of the chinese railroad workers in the us .", "because they want to create a record of the object and spoken history from the families of the railroad workers ."], "human": ["Because they want to help the Chinese railroad workers ' descendants to get together .", "Because they want to show the importance of America ' s first transcontinental railroad .", "Because they want to learn more about how to build a railroad in the past in America .", "Because they want Americans to remember the Chinese railroad workers ' role in US history ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
