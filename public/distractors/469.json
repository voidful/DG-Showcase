{"id": "469", "article": "Hu Li ' s heart sank due to the color of the air . Driving 140 kilometers from Tianjin City to Beijing last week , she held her breath as the air became a charcoal grey haze . The 39yearold businesswoman has lived in Beijing for a decade , and this past month , she said , brought the worst air pollution she has ever seen . It gave her husband a cough and left her sevenyearold daughter housebound . \" My husband as well as I is working here , so we have no choice , \" she said . \" But if we had a choice , we ' d like to escape from Beijing . \" The extended heavy pollution over the last month , which caused punishment in return for a day last week - called the \" airpocalypse \" by internet users - has largely changed the way that Chinese think about the country ' s air . On one day , pollution levels were 30 times higher than levels considered safe by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . Flights were cancelled . Roads were closed . One hospital in east Beijing reported they had treated more than 900 children for breathing issues . Bloomberg found that for most of January , Beijing ' s air was worse than that of an airport smoking area . The smog ' s most threatening aspect is its high concentration of PM 2 . 5 - particulate matter that is small enough to breathe deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream , causing breathing infections , lung cancer and possibly damaging children ' s development . The WHO has estimated that outdoor air pollution accounts for two million deaths per year , 65 % of them in Asia .", "questions": "What ' s the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the bad effects of air pollution", "the air in beijing ' s air", "the damages of beijing ' s haze", "the air in beijing"], "human": ["Hu Li ' s attitudes to Beijing ' s haze", "WHO suggests improving Beijing ' s air", "What caused air pollution in Beijing", "The damages of Beijing ' s haze"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
