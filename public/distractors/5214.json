{"id": "5214", "article": "The advertisement appeared in my e - mail - - \" 1 - 800 - Flowers : Mother ' s Day Madness - - for just $ 39 . 99 ! \" I almost clicked on it , forgetting that those services would not be needed this year . My mother , Margaret Feiddman , died at the age of 89 , and so this is my first Mother ' s Day without my mom . In my childhood , my mom appeared to be a typical suburban housewife of her generation . She sewed many of my sisters ' clothes , including both of their wedding dresses and boy ' s suits for me . And on the side , she won several national bridge tournaments . My mom left many indelible marks on me . The first was to never lose heart and to be independent . My dad died suddenly when I was 19 . My mom worked hard for a couple of years . But in1975 , I won a scholarship to study in Britain and my mom surprised us all by announcing that she decided to go with me . When I met difficulties , she always said : \" You ' re a man , so never lose heart , never be knocked down , and try your best to pursue your dreams . \" My mom ' s other big influence on me is a sense of optimism . She had taken her knocks . But every time life knocked her down , she got up and kept on marching forward , encouraged by the saying that pessimists are usually right , optimists are usually wrong , but most great changes are made by optimists . How I wish to listen to my mother ' s words , and give my best regards on this Mother ' s Day , but I have no chance now ! My best friends , treasure your mother ' s love !", "questions": "What experience of the author ' s mother surprised the author ?", "options": {"model": ["that she volunteered to go to britain with her son .", "that she went to britain with her son ."], "human": ["That she won several national bridge tournaments .", "That she volunteered to go to Britain with her son ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
