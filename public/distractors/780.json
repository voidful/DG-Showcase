{"id": "780", "article": "Are extraverts really better leaders ? Can an introvert be a good leader ? Research has shown a consistent positive relationship between extraversion and leadership . In groups of strangers , such as a jury , extraversion predicts who will be selected foreperson of the jury . It ' s actually likely to be the person who talks the most , and that person is probably an extravert . So , extraverts are more likely to be chosen for leadership positions ( what we call leader \" emergence \" ) . There is also a positive relationship ( although a weaker one ) between extraversion and leader effectiveness , particularly evaluated effectiveness of leaders . So it appears that extraverts have _ an _ edge , _ but does this mean that introverts ca n ' t be good leaders ? Of course not ! Many successful leaders are introverted , for example Abraham Lincoln , Gandhi , and in business , Bill Gates and Warren Buffett . One of the best company presidents that I ' ve known was easily the most introverted person among his executive team , but he was very successful and his colleagues admired his \" quiet reserve and confidence \" . So what is the critical factor that both extraverts and introverts need to emerge as a leader and to be effective ? Our research has suggested that the key element is good interpersonal , or social , skills . In one study , we looked at the relationship of extraversion to leadership emergence and effectiveness and found that the advantage that extraverts had disappeared when we put social skills into the equation . In other words , only extraverts who possessed social skills were effective leaders . Good interpersonal skills are critical whether the leader is an extravert or an introvert . In addition , we know that we are more likely to choose leaders who look like their prototypes of leaders - - they speak well , interact well with others , and just look \" leader - like \" . Extraverts just naturally look more like a prototypical leader , particularly political leaders , than do introverts . Think of the U . S . presidential campaign where presidential hopefuls were evaluated for how much each looked like he or she could be the Commander - in - Chief . The key to leadership success then is to develop the people skills needed to look like a leader , but to", "questions": "Why does the author mention the U .
