{"id": "11", "article": "Researchers designing the ' classroom of the future ' have found that multi - touch , multi - user desks can improve skills in mathematics . New results from a 3 - year project working with over 400 pupils , mostly 8 - 10 year olds , show that cooperation learning increases both fluency and flexibility in maths . It also shows that using an interactive ' smart ' desk can have Benefits over doing mathematics on paper . Using multi - touch desks in the new classroom , the children were able to work together in new ways to solve problems using inventive solutions . Seeing what your friends are doing , and being able to fully participate in group activities , offers new ways of working in class , the researchers say . The ' Star Trek classroom ' could also help learning and teaching in other subjects . Lead researcher , Professor Liz Burd , said : \" Our aim was to encourage far higher levels Of active student engagement , where knowledge is obtained by sharing , problem - solving and creating , rather than by passive listening . This classroom enables both active engagement and equal access . \" \" We found our tables encouraged students to cooperate more effectively . We were delighted to observe groups of students improving their understanding of mathematical concepts . Such cooperation just did not happen when students used paper - based approaches . \" The teacher plays a key role in the classroom and can send tasks to different tables to individuals and groups . The teacher can also send one group ' s answers on to the next group to work on and add to , or to the board for a class discussion . A live feedback of the desks goes directly to the teacher who can come quickly to help an individual while allowing the group work to continue . Such a classroom may be some way off being a regular feature of schools across the . World due to the costs in setting it up . However , in just 3 years the project team have noted major improvements in the technology , and a reduction in costs .", "questions": "What can we learn about ' Star Trek classroom ' from the text ?", "options": {"model": ["it can be helpful in both learning and teaching .", "it can help students in their lessons .", "it can be used in both teaching and teaching ."], "human": ["It is specially designed for pupils 8 - 10 years old .", "It only brings benefits to the active students .", "It can be helpful in both learning and teaching ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
