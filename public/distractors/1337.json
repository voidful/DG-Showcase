The slightest move makes you jump with pain . Nothing could be worse than a pain in the neck . That is why we use the phrase to describe some people who give you the same feeling . We have all met such people . One is the man who always seems to be clapping his hands - - often at the wrong time - - during a performance in the theater . He keeps you from hearing the actors . Even worse are those who can never arrive before the curtain goes up and the play begins . They come hurrying down to your row of seats .

We must not forget the man who comes into a bus or subway and sits down next to you , just as close as you will let him . You are reading the newspaper and he gets closer so that he can read the paper with you . He may even turn the paper to the next page before you are ready for it .
