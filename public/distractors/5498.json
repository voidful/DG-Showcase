{"id": "5498", "article": "Two studies are suggesting that some overweight people do not face an increased risk of developing heart disease . Researchers also found that some individuals of normal body weight have an increased risk of the disease . Being overweight does increase your risk of medical problems , but the studies found that not all heavy people are less healthy than thin people . In one study , American researchers examined medical records from over 5000 men and women . Each person had taken part in a separate study from 1999 to 2004 . The searchers found that about 51 % of them were overweight or obese . About 32 % were obese , but considered metabolically healthy . This means they had no evidence of problems in tests for high blood pressure or other factors linked to heart disease . However , more than 23 % of people who were at a healthy weight were unhealthy in two or more aspects Judith WylieRosett helped carry out the American study . She says the finding show that all obese person can still be healthy . She believes that having body fat is not as important as where the fat is found on body . It ' s reported that twothirds of Americans are considered overweight or obese . A second study is suggesting that fat in the liver may be an important health risk . Norbert Stefan and his team closely examined 314 people . They measured how much body fat each person had , and where it was on the body . To do this , they used medical imaging tests . They discovered that obese people could have healthy hearts . Their results suggest that fat in the liver is more dangerous than fat in other areas . The results of both studies were published recently in the Archives of Internal Medicine . Professor WylieRosett says the findings do n ' t mean that people should n ' t be concerned about obesity . Experts say there are several diseases linked to obesity that make it more dangerous to be fat than thin . They say people should see their doctor to learn what health risks they may be facing and what behaviours should be changed to improve health .", "questions": "The text is mainly about evidence that some people can", "options": {"model": ["have body fat", "have a higher body fat", "be both fat and healthy", "be healthier than fat in the liver"], "human": ["develop heart disease", "increase weight", "have too much fat in the liver", "be both fat and healthy"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
