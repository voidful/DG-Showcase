{"id": "4598", "article": "When Abraham Lincoln was young , he worked in a store . One day a woman came into the store and bought some things . They added up to two dollars and six and a quarter cents . The bill was paid , and the woman was satisfied . But the young storekeeper , not feeling quite sure about his calculations , added up the things again . To his surprise he found that it should have been but two dollars . \" I ' ve made her pay six and a quarter cents more , \" said young Abe , upset . It was an unimportant thing , and many salespersons would forget it , but Abe was too careful for that . \" The money must be paid back , \" he decided . At night , he closed the store and walked to the home of his customer . He explained the matter , paid over the six and a quarter cents , and returned satisfied . Here is another story of young Lincoln ' s strict honesty . A woman entered the store and asked for half a pound of tea . The young man weighed it out . This was the last sale of the day . The next morning , when beginning his duties , Abe discovered a four - ounce weight on the scales . It flashed upon him at once that he had used this in the sale last night , and so , of course , given his customer short weight . Many people would not have been much worried by this discovery . But Abe weighed out the balance of the half pound , shut up the store , and carried it to the customer . I think that the name , so often given in late times to President Lincoln , of \" Honest Old Abe \" , was well deserved .", "questions": "What happened to Abe in the second story ?", "options": {"model": ["he did n ' t believe in the woman ' s idea .", "it was the first time that he had used this in the sale .", "he did n ' t notice a four - ounce weight on the scales ."], "human": ["He was n ' t paid two dollars and six cents .", "He explained the matter to the customer that night .", "He did n ' t notice a four - ounce weight on the scales ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
