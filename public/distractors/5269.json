{"id": "5269", "article": "The bar - tailed godwit has just broken its own record for the world ' s longest non - stop flight , including humans in planes , according to a report made by Lund University Press . The bird can fly non - stop for eight days , while the most impressive man - made airplane can only remain in the sky for 82 hours without a stop . The bar - tailed godwit ' s journey , from Alaska to New Zealand , covers over 6 , 835 miles . It completes this trip twice a year , in autumn going to New Zealand , and in spring back to Alaska . The tireless bird ends the trip without stopping once for food or rest . All other birds can only finish trips that are twice as short as what the bar - tailed godwit travels . One reason for the bar - tailed godwit ' s success is that it has made the best use of its fuel , which is only 0 . 41 percent of its body weight over each hour of any given long flight . Hedenstrom , a professor from Lund University , says , \" This figure is extremely low compared with other birds . \" The bird also has a special body shape that helps it fly easily . It stores body fat and protein to manage its trips . It also travels fast , compared to other birds and animals . Many questions remain about this bird record holder that never gets lost in the air . Researchers wonder whether it has an inside compass that helps it to know the direction . Please watch how beautiful bar - tailed godwits look as they come in for a landing , along with other birds .", "questions": "What is the text mainly about ?", "options": {"model": ["a man who can fly in the sky for nearly an hour .", "a bird that breaks the record for the longest non - stop flight .", "a bird that has a special body shape .", "a bird that uses the longest non - stop flight ."], "human": ["Birds and airplanes that can fly over a long distance .", "Reasons for the bar - tailed godwit ' s long - distance flight .", "An introduction to long - distance flights of birds and humans .", "A bird that breaks the record for the longest non - stop flight ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
