{"id": "2574", "article": "Looking back on my childhood , I am convinced that naturalists are born and not made . Although we were all brought up in the same way , my brothers and sisters soon abandoned their pressed flowers and insects . Unlike them , I had no ear for music and languages . I was not an early reader and I could not do mental arithmetic . Before World War I we spent our summer holidays in Hungary . I have only the dim memory of the house we lived in , of my room and my toys . Nor do I recall clearly the large family of grandparents , aunts , uncles and cousins who gathered next door . But I do have a clear memory of the dogs , the farm animals , the local birds , and above all , the insects . I am a naturalist , not a scientist . I have a strong love of the natural world and my enthusiasm led me into varied investigations . I love discussing my favorite topics and enjoy burning the midnight oil while reading about other people ' s observations and discoveries . Then something happens that brings these observations together in my conscious mind . Suddenly you fancy you see the answer to the riddle , because it all seems to fit together . This has resulted in my publishing 300 papers and books , which some might honor with the title of scientific research . But curiosity , a keen eye , a good memory and enjoyment of the animal and plant world do not make a scientist : one of the outstanding and essential qualities required is self - discipline , a quality I lack . A scientist requires not only self - discipline , but hard training , determination and a goal . A scientist , up to a certain point , can be made . A naturalist is born . If you can combine the two , you get the best of both worlds .", "questions": "Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage ?
