Hold that stretch for 30 seconds ! \" My dance teacher works hard to form us into the dancers we desire to be . In order for this to occur , we stretch hard a lot ! Dancing is a real passion of many people , including me . I work hard to make myself better , and prove that I am good enough . Performing a dance routine is more than just a performance . Dancers tell stories when they dance . It is a way for us to express our personal feelings . Just letting go and letting your body move with the music can create your emotions . Dance tells us things that our mind secretly hides . \" Get up and do it again ! You need to keep your spirits up ! \" Even though I am completely worn out after my dances , I love to hear those words . It gives me a sense of relief knowing that I can again express my feelings out on the floor . \" Practice makes perfect ! Come on . We have a competition this weekend , and we need to work harder ! \" Competitions are the best possible example of fun . For a dancer , life can not get better than competitions . The thrill of losing yourself onstage is a rush of energy rushing through your body ! The feeling is unexplainable . As you sit there putting on your makeup , fixing your hair , and putting on your costume , the rush just gradually grows until it is ready to be released onstage . Finally the time comes to tell your story . Standing backstage waiting for your name to be called is one of the scariest moments . You are ready to show the world what you are capable of and what you have been perfecting for a while . Once your number is called , you walk out onstage . The applause at the end tells each dancer that their story has been received , and that the dance has been brought to life .", "questions": "How does the author understand dancing according to the text ?", "options": {"model": ["it is a way to express our feelings .", "it is a way to show our personal emotions .", "it is a way to express our emotions in a dancing class ."], "human": ["It is a good way to release stress .", "It takes talent , confidence and patience to dance well .", "It is a way to show our personal emotions ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
