{"id": "2601", "article": "Contrary to people ' s previous knowledge , it ' s food shortage not dietary preference that motivates birds to migrate thousands of miles back and forth between breeding and nonbreeding areas each year , a new research shows . \" It ' s not whether you eat insects , fruits or candy bars or where you eat them that counts , but how reliable that daytoday food source is , \" said the study leader W . Alice Boyle of the University of Arizona . To figure out the underlying pressure that drives some birds to leave home for the season , Boyle examined 379 related species of New World flycatchers and compared their sizes , food types , habitats , migratory behaviors and whether or not they fed in flocks . To compare the birds , the researchers constructed a \" supertree \" showing the exact evolutionary relationships among different species . A computer analysis then determined whether a particular species was migratory because it ran in the \" family \" or whether something in the bird ' s environment was forcing it to leave each season . Boyle and her colleagues found that food shortage was the number one issue that predicted a species ' migratory behavior . \" Food availability is the underlying pressure , not diet and habitat , \" Boyle said . An alternative strategy that the birds use to handle food shortage is to hunt in flocks , since a group is more likely to find a new source of food than an individual . \" If you suffer from food shortage , you have two options , \" Boyle said . \" You can either hunt with other birds or you can migrate . \"", "questions": "The passage implies that", "options": {"model": ["the birds ' food sources are getting rare in the world", "the birds ' food sources are becoming more and more birds", "the birds ' food sources are becoming rare", "the bird ' s food resources have been increased"], "human": ["the living surroundings are severe for birds", "birds search for food separately", "birds can survive only by hunting in flocks", "the birds ' food sources are getting rare in the world"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
