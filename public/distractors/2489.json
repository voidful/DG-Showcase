{"id": "2489", "article": "Tea , the most important of English drinks , is a relative latecomer to British shores . Although the custom of drinking tea dates back to the third millennium BC in China , it was not until the mid 17 th century that tea first appeared in England . Afternoon tea was introduced in England by Anna , the seventh Duchess of Bedford , in the year 1840 . The Duchess would become hungry around four o ' clock in the afternoon . The evening meal in her household was served fashionably late at eight o ' clock , thus leaving a long period of time between lunch and dinner . The Duchess asked her servant to bring a tray of tea , bread , butter and cake to her room during the late afternoon . This became a habit of hers and she began inviting friends to join her . This pause for tea became a fashionable social event . During the 1880 ' s upper class and society women would change into long gowns , gloves and hats for their afternoon tea which was usually served in the drawing room between four and five o ' clock . Traditional afternoon tea consists of a selection of dainty sandwiches , scones served with cream and jams . Cakes and pastries are also served . Tea grown in India or Ceylon is poured from silver teapots into delicate bone china cups . Nowadays , however , in the average suburban home , afternoon tea is likely to be just a biscuit or small cake and a mug of tea , usually produced using a teabag .", "questions": "According to the passage , we can learn that", "options": {"model": ["afternoon tea was introduced in england by anna", "in the 19th century tea began in england", "the reason why the duchess was hungry at 4 p . m . is that dinner time came quite late", "afternoon tea was introduced in england"], "human": ["Tea appeared in England much earlier than in China", "In the suburban home , afternoon tea is also served in a dainty way", "Tea grown in India or Ceylon is poured from china teapots into delicate bone silver cups .", "The reason why the Duchess was hungry at 4 p . m . is that dinner time came quite late"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
