A judgement study and think about the material presented to him , accept it , correct it , or reject it after thinking over what he has read , watched or heard . Another word for criticism is appreciation . When I criticize or appreciate some objector another , I look for its good points and bad points . In reading any printed or written matter , I always have a pencil in hand and put any comments in the book or on a separate paper . In other words , I always talk back to the writer . That sort of critical reading might well be called creative reading because I am thinking along with the author , asking him questions , seeing whether he answers the questions and how well he answers them . I mark the good passages to store them in my memory piece of writing ; where , how and why could or should I improve upon it ? You might think that doing what I suggested is work . Yes , it is , but the work is a pleasure because I can feel my brain expanding , my emotion reacting and my way of living change . Reading exercises is a great influence on a person . If pictures , still or moving , accompany the reading , the memory will retain the material for a long time . Just as evil books can corrupt , so also can good books gradually work a change on a corrupt person . Let ' s get back to the beneficial effects of thinking while reading . It helps us to enlarge our minds . We understand more about the universe , its people and many of its wonders . We learn to think and observe in new ways . We certainly do get a feeling for the language we are reading . All good writers in any language have been readers who read critically and continuously .", "questions": "According to the writer , critical reading", "options": {"model": ["broaden a person ' s horizons", "helps a good writer improve his thinking"], "human": ["gives a person extra work .", "broaden a person ' s horizons"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
