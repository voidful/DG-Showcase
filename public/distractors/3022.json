But hard - working Owens can stop for at least a moment ' s celebration after making his first PS1 million at the age of 16 . Owens , who has used a computer since the age of seven , began teaching himself basic web design at the age of ten when he was given his first Mac computer . He used his pocket money to fund his first business project , website Mac Box Bundle at just 14 which has made PS700 000 since its establishment in 2008 . Mac Box Bundle sells a combination of popular Mac applications which are worth up to $ 400 together for under just $ 100 and donates 10 percent of the money to charities . He then established an advertising company Branchr a year later and worked on the business after school and at weekends . Branchr made a surprising PS500 000 in its first year . Branchr works as a platform for website owners to sell advertising . Owens , from Northampton , currently employs eight staff - - all adults - - around the UK and America as sales and technical assistants . The young man lives with his parents . His mother who is a company secretary said he was inspired to go into business after observing the huge success achieved by Apple ' s chief executive officers Steve Jobs . Owens said , \" I think everyone has business sense in them , and they just need to gain experience and be determined to make it . There is no magical formula for business . It takes hard work , determination and the drive to do something great . My aim is to become a leading name in the world of Internet and mobile advertising and push myself right to the top of the game . The teenager insists his professional success has not affected his personal life , and says his interests include photography and playing the guitar . \" My friends and I do n ' t really talk about my success . To them I ' m just a normal teenager and it does n ' t change anything between us . \"", "questions": "Owens tends to think that .", "options": {"model": ["working on the business is a good idea", "everyone needs to gain experience in business", "every person has potential talent for business"], "human": ["getting experienced in business needs determination", "it is hard work for people to decide to do something great", "every person has potential talent for business"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
