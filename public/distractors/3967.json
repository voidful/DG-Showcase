A first step towards genetic _ has been taken by researchers in the US who link specific DNA markers with face shape . To identify the genes , they focused on known mutations that cause changes of the face and head . Normal versions of these genes were found to influence individual features . For instance , one gene affected the lips , another the shape and configuration of bones around the eyes , and a third the appearance of the mid - face and skull . In total , 20 genes had \" significant effects \" on facial appearance . Lead scientist Professor Mark Shriver , from Pennsylvania State University , said : \" We use DNA to match to an individual or identify an individual , but you can get so much more from DNA . Currently we ca n ' t go from DNA to a face , or from a face to DNA , but it should be possible . \" The implications are far reaching , raising the possibility of creating a data bank of facial types based on genetic markers . DNA from a crime scene could then be used to produce a rough image of the face of an offender or victim . Such genetic mugshots may be more reliable than computer - generated \" e - fits \" based on witnesses ' recollections . Other uses of the technique might include proving the identity of fathers in paternity cases , or visualising our remote ancestors from fossil DNA . The scientists wrote in the online journal Public Library of Science Genetics : \" Such predictive modelling could be forensically useful ; for example , DNA left at crime scenes could be tested and faces predicted in order to help to narrow the pool of potential suspects . Further , our methods could be used to predict the facial features of descendants , deceased ancestors , and even extinct human species . In addition , these methods could prove to be useful diagnostic tools . \" The team developed a model which first established a range of physical face shapes from people of mixed West African and European ancestry from the US , Brazil and Cape Verde . Measurements were taken of thousands of point co - ordinates on grids placed over 3D images of the faces . Statistical methods were then used to determine the relationship between facial differences and the effects of gender", "questions": "According to Professor Mark Shriver , we know", "options": {"model": ["it is impossible to change dna from a face to dna", "a person ' s body structure has nothing to do with a person ' s body structure", "there is a possibility of going from dna to a face"], "human": ["they can merely match to an individual or identify an individual", "DNA could be used to produce a rough image of an offender ' s face", "there is a possibility of going from DNA to a face"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
