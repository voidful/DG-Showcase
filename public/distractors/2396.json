{"id": "2396", "article": "Babies born in summer are more likely to become short - sighted in late life , a study has shown . As many as a quarter of all cases of short - sightedness are caused by too great an exposure to sunlight in the first weeks of life , say eye experts . They are advising all parents to put sunglasses on their babies during the first weeks . Scientists had already established that over - exposure to sunlight caused shortsightedness in animals . Researchers who compared the months in which babies were born with whether they needed glasses later on say the principle also applies to humans . A study of almost 300 , 000 young adults - the largest of its kind - showed that those born in June and July had a 25 per cent greater chance of becoming severely short - sighted than those born in December or January . Research leader Professor Michael Belkin , of Tel Aviv University , said it was because prolonged illumination causes the eyeball to lengthen - causing short - sightedness . Hence the more light a newborn is exposed to , the more the eyeball lengthens and the worse the short - sightedness will be . The mechanism which lengthens the eyeball is associated with levels of melatonin , a pigment which protects the skin against harmful rays of the sun . In young babies not enough melatonin is released as protection , meaning they are more _ to sunburn and changes to eyeball shape . Sight expert Professor Daniel O ' Leary , of Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge , said \" At the moment we do n ' t know the precise cause of why light exposure affects sight , but the evidence seems to prove that it is one of the reasons for people becoming shortsighted . \"", "questions": "Melatonin is a kind of material to", "options": {"model": ["protect the skin against harmful rays of the sun", "protect the skin from harmful sun rays"], "human": ["protect babies ' eyes from summer sun", "protect the skin from harmful sun rays"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
