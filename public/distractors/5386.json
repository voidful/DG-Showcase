{"id": "5386", "article": "The marathon in my town usually takes place in hot weather . My job was to follow the runners to help those who needed medical help . \" We should stay behind the last runner , so take it slowly , \" I said to the driver , Doug . As it began , the front runners started to disappear . Then I noticed a woman in blue running shorts and a white T - shirt . \" Doug , look ! \" We knew we were watching our \" last runner \" . Her feet turned in , yet her left knee turned out . Her legs were so crippled that it seemed impossible for her to be able to walk . How could she run a marathon ? We watched in silence as she slowly moved forward . We would move forward a little bit , then stop and wait for her . Then we would slowly move forward a little bit more . As I watched her try to put one foot in front of the other , I found myself breathing for her . I wanted her to stop , and at the same time , I hoped that she would n ' t . Finally , she was the only runner left in sight . When the finishing line came into sight , we found the cheering people had all gone home . She slowly crossed through the line and lifted her hands , full of happiness . I do not know the woman ' s name , but since that day she has become a part of my life . For her , it was about finishing what she had set out to do , no matter what . When I think things are too difficult and want to say \" I just ca n ' t do it \" , I think of the last runner . Then I realize how easy the task before me really is .", "questions": "Why did the woman take part in the marathon ?", "options": {"model": ["to finish what she had decided to do", "to finish what she had done in the marathon"], "human": ["To beat the other runners", "To finish what she had decided to do"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
