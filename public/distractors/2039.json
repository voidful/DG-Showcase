{"id": "2039", "article": "Christmas is long gone . and Valentine ' s Day is a distant memory . That means it ' s a slow time for jewelers , and a good time for you to make a purchase . Whether you ' re out shopping for gold , or silver , here fife a few things you need to know : What determines price ? The purity of the metal is one of the elements that determines the price . Gold purity is indicated with a stamp of 10 K , 14 K , 18 K , or 24K . And different countries have their own standards . For example , for a piece to be considered gold in the US , it must be at least 10K . In Britain and Canada : 9K . In Italy and France : l 8K . Anything over l 8 K is really too soft for everyday wear . That ' s why jewelry stores in the US sell mostly 14K . How much can you expect to pay ? That depends on the weight of the metal and the gemstone . So keep that in mind , especially when buying online . To keep yourself from _ , ask yourself the following : * How long has the company been around ? * What is its return policy ? * Is the jewelry featured on the website visible from all directions ? * Is the company transparent with the gram weights and the size of the gemstones ? Yellow gold ? White ? Rose ? Yes , it ' s confusing , and while this is largely a personal decision , there fife a few things to keep in mind . For starters . white or rose gold costs about l 0 % more than yellow gold . If you want the \" look for less \" , consider gold . plated jewelry . \" Gold plated \" and \" gold overlay \" mean the same thing and guarantee a thicker layer of finish than \" vermeil \" which is a flash finish that is thinner and less consistent , but more affordable . Buy vermeil finished pieces you want for a season or two just to follow the fashion . For pieces you want to wear for a lifetime , solid gold is best . What about sterling silver ? Sterling silver has been . an alternative for white gold during the difficult economy , and while it used to be more popular with just the younger these days it has much more mass appeal .
