{"id": "5145", "article": "Planted for their fragrance and beauty , roses historically have been the center of much praise and are one of the most universal symbols of love and life . As the phrase goes , sometimes you do have to \" stop and smell the roses \" . Although you may think that this is just a fancy way of saying taking some time to enjoy life , perhaps we have dismissed roses for too long . Seriously , you should pay more attention to those roses . They could greatly improve your life . That is , if you are one of the millions of people in the US who suffer from arthritis diseases . Result from two different arthritis studies have proved that an active ingredient of rose hips has been shown to protect and possibly rebuild joint tissue broken down by arthritis . The latest results , presented at the World Conference in Rome showed that protein GOPO ( R ) found in rose hips can protect vulnerable cartilage . GOPO ( R ) has also been shown to improve mood , increase energy and sleep quality of those affected by arthritis . Marked by stiffness , swelling , loss of flexibly and pain , arthritis can significantly stop one from a normal life . \" We have little doubt that certain rose hip preparations , and GOPO ( R ) in particular , have had an important role to play in reducing the pain and disability caused by arthritis , \" said Winther . With the aid of this new research , those affected by joint pain caused by arthritis could choose an alternative treatment than pain killers . \" We suspect that more people will be turning to the power of rose - hip for joint pain relief , \" said Winther . Sorry Shakespeare , but in this case , no other rose could smell as sweet .", "questions": "The author asks us to pay more attention to roses because", "options": {"model": ["roses have been the center of much praise", "roses are a common way to keep healthy", "roses have some unknown uses", "it is the center of many praise"], "human": ["roses can represent love and life", "roses are very sweet", "we are so busy as to ignore roses", "roses have some unknown uses"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
