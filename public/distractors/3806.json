{"id": "3806", "article": "Mary Jean Price Walls graduated second in her class in 1950 . She had high hopes when she applied to a local college , Southwest Missouri State College . But after sending off her application , she spent months waiting for a reply . It never came . Worse than simply being denied admission , the school did n ' t reply to her at all . It was n ' t a matter of her school records , but of her skin color : Wallsis African American , and in those days , that fact alone closed a lot of doors . \" I was sad and I was hurt , \" Walls toldABCNews . \" I did not expect the skin color would affect my application . I thought I could go to university like other students . \" Four years later , the government declared that all schools should not discriminate against African Americans - - but it was too late for Walls . She ' d moved on with her life , becoming a wife and a mother , and working as an elevator operator . She retired last year , at the age of 77 . She stayed quiet about the unfairness she ' d faced in Missouri State . Her son , Terry , went through school records and found that she ' d been the first black student to ever apply to the college . Today , four percent of the Southwest Missouri State College body is African American - - including Terry . Although it ' s too late for Missouri State to change the past , the school is awarding Walls with an honorary degree from the school . While she knows it ' s too late for herto change the course of her own life with the degree , it ' s a chance for her to show her family that Missouri State has changed in the last 60 years , and there ' s not a single door closed to them anymore .", "questions": "What can we infer from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["it was no longer a matter of her school records to get used to .", "walls did not fight for her right to education ."], "human": ["The college did not receive Walls ' s application .", "Walls did not fight for her right to education ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
