{"id": "5656", "article": "There are many acceptable varieties of English throughout the world . Whichever variety is used in your country , the most important thing is that students ' pronunciation must be good enough for another person to understand what they are trying to say . In a PPP lesson , teachers naturally include a good model of the pronunciation when they are presenting new vocabulary , grammar or functional language . It is important to start by helping your students recognize sounds before you expect them to produce them . Spoken British English has 44 sounds , but there are only 26 letters in the alphabet for written English . This sometimes makes English pronunciation and spelling different , so it is not always best to write words on the blackboard at the early stages . Also , some sounds in English do not exist in some other languages . This can make it very difficult for students to recognize these sounds and even more difficult for them to pronounce them correctly . So some students need to do a lot of work on these sounds , listening to them , trying to recognize them and trying to copy them . If you can understand and pronounce the symbols of the phonetic alphabet , this will help you to pronounce any word in the dictionary . You can teach this phonetic alphabet to your students and this will make teaching pronunciation much easier . However , you can teach pronunciation effectively without knowing the phonetic alphabet . Pronouncing English well is not just about getting the individual sounds right . Students need to know : * which parts of a word are stressed ( spoken louder and longer ) ; * which parts of a sentence are stressed ; * basic intonation patterns ; * what it means when we change the intonation in a sentence ( the music of the language ) ; * how to link together the sounds within a sentence . Students need practice in all these areas to improve their pronunciation .", "questions": "In the author ' s opinion ,", "options": {"model": ["students should learn to pronounce any single word in the dictionary", "pronunciation means more than knowing how to pronounce every single word", "students need n ' t learn how to pronounce every single word", "the english spelling is more difficult than the other languages"], "human": ["it is not necessary to pronounce every word correctly", "the English phonetic alphabet is a must in teaching pronunciation", "students should pronounce every word as precisely as native speakers", "pronunciation means more than knowing how to pronounce every single word"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
