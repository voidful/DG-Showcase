{"id": "275", "article": "Many science fiction stories tell about explorers arriving in a new world . The explorers then use some kind of high - tech device to test for breathable air or signs of life . But here on Earth , science fiction is becoming reality through a new sampling technology called environmental DNA , or e - DNA for short . Scientists can use it to identify rare or invasive species , study bio - diversity or estimate fish populations with just a little air or water . Ryan Kelly is an ecologist at the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington in Seattle . He works in a laboratory there with other researchers . They study the genetic material released by living creatures . \" Essentially we can take a sample of soil or air - - and in our case - - water , and we can sequence ( to arrange the order of genes ) the DNA out of it and tell you what is there . \" Ryan Kelly says he and his research team are studying water samples collected from Puget Sound . He says the cost of gene sequencing has \" been reduced greatly in recent years . \" That makes DNA testing more widely available . Environmental DNA can be used in two ways . One is to identify the creatures that live in a certain place . The other is to confirm the presence or lack of a specific creature . Caren Goldberg heads the new e - DNA lab at Washington State University in Pullman , Washington . She is one of the first biologists in the northwestern United States to take the technology from the testing phase to actually using it . \" It is extremely useful for species that are really hard to find . I have spent many hours looking for species that I was pretty sure were there - - looking under rocks , looking in water , doing all kinds of surveys . \" Caren Goldberg sees e - DNA as a way to get answers more efficiently , safely and with less destruction compared to traditional survey techniques . Until recently , scientists depended on diving deep , netting or using an electric current to temporarily catch fish . \" We ' re absolutely at this point where proof - of - concept has been established . I do n ' t think everyone necessarily is ready for it yet , but I think the majority of people are . \" This newer", "questions": "What has made E - DNA magic is that with E - DNA", "options": {"model": ["you will know more about e - dna than before", "you are likely to find information about a species with a little air , water , or soil", "you will know more about a species with a little air or water"], "human": ["some kind of high - tech device can be used to test for breathable air or signs of life", "the cost of gene sequencing has been reduced greatly in recent years .", "you are likely to find information about a species with a little air , water , or soil"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
