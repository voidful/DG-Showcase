{"id": "1476", "article": "The effects of air pollution on natural conditions have been a disturbing problem for many years . Some scientists hold the view that the air inside houses may be more dangerous than the air outside . It may even be one hundred times worse . Most scientists agree that every modern house has some kind of indoor pollution , which can cause a person to feel tired , to suffer eye pain , headache and other problems . Believe it or not , some pollutants can cause breathing diseases of blood and even cancer . What made us feel relieved is that there ' s growing concern about the problem now . It is true that when builders began constructing houses and offices they did not want to waste energy . they built buildings that prevented or limited the flow of air between inside and outside . For the same purpose , man - made building materials were employed to build houses , which are now known to let out some harmful gases . Facing the serious challenge , scientists have been searching for a way to handle the problem . To everyone ' s delight , they discovered a natural pollution control system for building - - green plants , though they do not really know how plants control air pollution . Scientists suppose that a plant ' s leaves absorb or take in the pollutants and in exchange gives out oxygen through its leaves and tiny organizations on its roots . Therefore they recommend that all buildings should have one large plant or several small plants inside for every nine square meters of space . Because studies indicate that different plants absorb different chemicals , the most effective way to clean the air is to use different kinds of plants . In conclusion , having green plants inside your house can make it a prettier and healthier place .
