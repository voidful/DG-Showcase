{"id": "3040", "article": "Do you sometimes argue about what seems to you to be a simple fact ? Do you argue whether it ' s cold outdoors or whether the car in front of you is going faster than the speed limit ? If you get into such arguments , try to think about the story about the six blind men and the elephant . The first blind man who felt the elephant ' s trunk said it was like a snake . The second who felt the elephant ' s side said it was like a wall , while the third said it was like a spear as he touched the animal ' s tusk . The fourth , who had hold of the elephant ' s tail insisted that it was like a rope . The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arm around one the elephant ' s legs . The sixth , who was tall and got hold of the elephant ' s ears , said it was like a huge fan . Each man ' s idea of the animal came from his own experience . So if someone disagrees with you about a \" simple fact \" , it ' s often because his experience in the matter is different from yours . To see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a \" simple fact \" , try this simple experiment . Get three large bowls . Put ice water in one . Put hot water in the second . Put lukewarm water in the third . Now put your left hand in the ice water . Put your right hand in the hot water . After thirty seconds , put both hands in the lukewarm water . Your right hand will tell you the water is cold . Your left hand will tell you it ' s hot !", "questions": "The writer ' s advice is", "options": {"model": ["we should put our right hand in the hot water", "we should always think about the fact", "we should never judge something with a one - sided view", "we should put our left hand in the water"], "human": ["We should never think about simple facts", "We should not agree about simple facts", "We must learn from the six blind men", "We should never judge something with a one - sided view"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
