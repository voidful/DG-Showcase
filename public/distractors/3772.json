{"id": "3772", "article": "Elizabeth Bishop , who was famous for the poetry A Prodigal , Filling Station , Sandpiper , Manuelzinho and so on , was an influential American poet of the 20th century . Her poetry often shows things that concerned her throughout her life , such as her search for a sense of home . Her troubled childhood and feelings of loneliness from this time affected her character and poetry . Bishop ' s painful childhood is apparent in some of her poems . Her father died when she was eight months old and her mother was mad when she was five . Bishop was raised firstly by her mother ' s parents and then by her father ' s parents . This experience left her confused about belonging . She had no home and this was shown in her poetry . In \" A Prodigal \" , when the character in the poem makes up his mind to go home , there is a sense of pessimism for Bishop who has no home . The lack of a sense of home has contributed to her depression all her life . Bishop attempts to make small , everyday experiences extraordinary in her poems such as \" Filling Station \" . In \" Filling Station \" , Bishop describes the beautyof a family filling station . Although it is \" dirty \" there is order in it . Simple family life is celebrated in it . She recognizes the value of home and beauty in everyday life , but she is only an observer of these . Distance remains between her and the family at the filling station . Bishop ' s struggle to locate herself in the world is seen no more clearly than in \" sandpiper \" . It deals with searching for something in a confusing world . She uses the metaphor of the bird which is \" looking for something \" . The \" something \" is n ' t specific . It seems as if the bird does n ' t know what he wants ; the only certain thing is that he is searching . Bishop ' s poems are personal on a more subtle level , especially when her childhood , travels , etc , are taken into consideration . It is believed that Bishop is a complex poet who uses her poetry to find this feeling of belonging .", "questions": "When reading Bishop ' s poems , people can find her search for", "options": {"model": ["the feeling of belonging", "her sense of home"], "human": ["a happy family life", "the feeling of belonging"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
