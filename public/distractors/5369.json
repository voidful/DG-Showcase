{"id": "5369", "article": "Australia has passed regulations that will enable more international students to further their education in the country . The new measures were released by the Australian Department of Tertiary Education , Skills , Jobs and Workplace Relations in September and will take effect in mid - 2012 . As a result , the student visa application process for overseas students has been simplified , and the deposit required to study in Australia has been reduced . Language requirements for overseas students have also been eased . Also , overseas students receiving a higher education in Australia will be granted a working visa lasting from two to four years after graduation , as long as they meet the basic IELTS requirement . \" This change will definitely make Australia a more attractive destination for Chinese students planning to study overseas , \" says Wang Lan , a consultant from Education International Cooperation Group ( EIC ) , a Beijing - based company that provides services to students wishing to study overseas . However , in the past few years , many of Wang ' s student clients could not start studies in Australia because they did not meet the language requirements , visa processing took a long time and deposit regulations were tough . The change in policy is good news for the parents of students wishing to study in Australia , Wang says . A 22 - year - old female student surnamed Li , in Beijing , who is planning to do her postgraduate studies in Australia , learned about the policy change several weeks ago . \" According to the previous deposit requirement for my student visa , my family was required to put down 550 , 000 yuan ( $ 86 , 850 ) . Now we only need to prepare 410 , 000 yuan . This is a relief for my parents , \" Li says . She also says that the two to four years working visa makes her feel much clearer about her study plans . \" I believe several years of working experience abroad will strengthen my competitiveness when I return to China , \" she says . Gaining a competitive advantage is the major reason for Chinese students to study abroad , according to the report by EIC .", "questions": "What ' s the main idea of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["australia widens window of opportunity for international students .", "more international students will be admitted into australia .", "more international students will study in australia .", "australia has done a lot of work experience overseas ."], "human": ["Language requirement for overseas students have been eased in Australia .", "Australia is a most attractive place for students in China .", "More students will work in Australia after their graduation .", "Australia widens window of opportunity for international students ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
