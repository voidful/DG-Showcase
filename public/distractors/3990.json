{"id": "3990", "article": "Hungry for the brightest students , many of the country ' s stronger universities are actively discounting tuition . And it ' s the high achievers , rather than the needy students , who are getting a good chunk of the money . The practice is remarkably widespread , reaching almost all but the 30 or so Ivy and other top colleges that forbid good grades - based financial aid . Schools are also becoming more aggressive in raising their discounts . At the DePauw University Website , enter an SAT or ACT score , grade point average and class rank , and a computer program immediately tells you what kind of \" award \" . Only \" the real unlucky \" pay full price any more . About 76 % of first - year students got some form of discount this year at 331 private schools . Average award per student : $ 7 , 000 . At small schools with tuition under about $ 20 , 000 , the average discount is even higher , with some schools returning over half their tuition . Carnegie Mellon even tells students it will \" negotiate \" and perhaps match financial - aid packages if kids are offered bigger awards at other schools . Much as banks and insurers offer special rates to their best customers , schools are giving the biggest breaks to their top students . Public four - year colleges , too , are offering discounts . The flip side of big discounts is that less money is available to improve academic programs and keep school infrastructure up to date . Universities that have sharply increased their tuition discount rates have seen graduation rates fall , and that ' s true even among highly selective schools . They get the students in the door , but do n ' t have the services to keep them .", "questions": "This passage mainly talks about", "options": {"model": ["schools ' bad grades - based financial aid", "the disadvantages of high - tuition", "college tuition discounts in popularity", "the disadvantages of college tuition"], "human": ["the great benefit of offering lower tuition", "the top students in need of tuition discounts", "reducing graduation rates due to big discounts", "college tuition discounts in popularity"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
