On the wall are maps , crisscrossed with brightly colors arrows that painstakingly track the fearsome path of the enemy . What kind of invader gives rise to such high - level monitoring ? Not man , not beast , but the lowly desert locust . In recent months , billions of the 3 - inch - long winged warriors have descended on Algeria , Libya , Morocco and Tunisia , blackening the sky and eating up crops and vegetation . The insect invasion , the worst in 30 years , is already creating great destruction in the Middle East and is now treating southern Europe . The current crisis began in late 1985 near the Red Sea . Unusually rainy weather moistened the sands of the Sudan , making them ideal seedbed for the locust , which lays its eggs in the earth . The insect onslaught threatens to create yet another African famine . Each locust can eat its weight ( not quite a tenth of an ounce ) in vegetation every 24 hours . A good - size swarm of 50 billion insects eats up 100 , 000 tons of grass , trees and crops in a single night . All $ 150 million may be needed this year . The U . S . has provided two spraying planes and about 50 , 000 gal . of pesticide . The European Community has donated $ 3 . 8 million in aid and the Soviet Union , Canada , Japan and China have provided chemical - spraying aircraft to help wipe out the pests . But relief efforts are hampered by the relative mildness of approved pesticides , which quickly lose their deadly punch and require frequent replications . The most effective locust killer dieldrin has been linked to cancer and is banned by many Western countries and some of the affected African nations . More than 5 million acres have been dusted with locust - killing chemicals ; another 5 million will be treated by the end of June . On May 30 , representatives of Tunisia , Algeria , Libya , Morocco and Mauritania will meet in Algiers to discuss tactics to wipe out the ravenous swarm", "questions": "Which of the following is true ?", "options": {"model": ["over 10 million acres of affected area will have been treated with locust - killing chemicals by the end of june .", "the number of locust - killing chemicals is increasing in the future .", "locust - killing chemicals will be treated by the world ."], "human": ["Once the pesticides are used , locust will die immediately .", "Dieldrin , the most effective locust killer , has been widely accepted in many countries .", "Over 10 million acres of affected area will have been treated with locust - killing chemicals by the end of June ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
