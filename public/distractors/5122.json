{"id": "5122", "article": "As you are soon on your way to Eastern Europe , here are a few tips on what you should pack . In general , pack lightly , with only the most basic clothes . People dress casually in Eastern Europe , so you do n ' t need to bring along your smartest clothing . Batteries : If your camera , flash , or other appliances run on batteries , bring enough supply along . Certain types of batteries do n ' t exist in Eastern Europe , and those that do often do n ' t last very long . Cash : We have found it good to have supply of small - unit U . S . bills ( $ 1and $ 5 ) to use in hard - currency stores , to buy international train tickets , etc . The hard - currency stores never seem to have the right _ . Electric Current Adapter : If you bring any appliances , remember that the electricity in Eastern Europe uses 220 volts A . C . , not the standard 110 volts of North America . A 110 volts appliance will soon burn out when attached to an unchanged 220 - volt plug . Language Tools : One of Europe ' s biggest challenges is communicating with the local people since their languages are so different from our own . To help overcome difficulties , you might buy phrasebooks before you go - - you wo n ' t find them once you are in Eastern Europe . Money Belt : A money belt is especially helpful when you have many documents to carry around ( as you always do in Eastern Europe ) . The best one we find is made by Eagle Greek Travel Gear , 143 Cedros Ave . ( P . O . box 651 ) , Solona Beach , CA 92075 ( tel . 619 / 755 - 9399 , or toll free 800 / 874 - 9925 ) outside California . Traveler ' s _ : These are necessary . Bring your traveler ' s checks in small to medium unit ( $ 10 , $ 20 , or $ 50 ) to change a little bit at a time , so as not to be left with a lot of local money .
