Three - dimensional , or 3D , means having three dimensions : width , height and depth . 3D technology is based on the way the human brain and eyes work . Because the _ of a person ' s eyes are about 6 . 5era apart , when we look at something , each eye sees it from a different angle . Our eyes send the two images to our brain , and the brain puts them together . The small difference between the image from the right eye and the image from the left eye allows us to see depth . When we view pictures and television in two dimensions , each eye gets the same information . That is because the image has no real depth , and there is only one of viewing it . So the goal of 3D technology is to get a different image into each of the viewer . It uses two film projectors . One projects a left eye image and the other projects a right image . The 3D glasses allow us to see a different image in each eye . While watching 3D films , we feel that we are in the same environment as the things we ' re watching . However , it also has its disadvantages . The 3D glasses work by controlling the amount of light that reaches the eyes . It makes the screen look darker . What ' s more , people with eye problems may get headaches if they spend too much time watching 3D movies , because their brains need to work harder to \" read \" the images .", "questions": "According to the passage , we can see 3D TV with the help of", "options": {"model": ["the special glasses", "both images"], "human": ["the image in the room", "the special glasses"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
