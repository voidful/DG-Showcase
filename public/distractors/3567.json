Situated on the south side of Hong Kong Island , this 870 , 000 square metre educational theme park provides many opportunities to learn about marine life . To start with , the park boasts the Atoll Reef , one of the world ' s largest aquariums , with about 2 , 500 fish from nearly 300 different species . What makes this aquarium special , however , is not just its size , but also its design . The Atoll Reef is built with an observation passageway that circles the aquarium on four different levels . This lets visitors view sea life from a variety of depths and angles . Then there ' s the Shark Aquarium , a tank with more than 200 sharks from more than 30 species . Like the Atoll Reef , this unique aquarium is designed to make sure guests get the most out of their visit . Shaped like an underwater tunnel , guests can watch as sharks swim overhead and dive at them from every side . There ' s also the Sea Jelly Spectacular , an aquarium that houses more than 1 , 000 jellyfish of all shapes , colours and sizes . And at the park ' s Dolphin University , visitors can go on educational tours and watch the training of dolphins up close . The park ' s most popular attraction is the Ocean Theatre , a huge outdoor pool where dolphins and sea lions entertain the visitors . Sometimes a killer whale even takes part in the performance ! Although Ocean Parks focus is on the water , the theme park has plenty of other activities , too . For people seeking excitement , there are rides like the Abyss Turbo Drop , a roller coaster ride that takes passengers on a 20 - storey drop straight down . There are also exhibits like the Dinosaur Discovery Trail and Bird Paradise . Finally , no trip to Ocean Park would be complete without visiting the park ' s most popular animals - - four giant pandas that were given as a gift from China ' s central government .", "questions": "What makes the Atoll Reef so special ?", "options": {"model": ["it allows visitors to watch sea life from all angles .", "it allows visitors to see sea life from a variety of depth .", "it allows visitors to view sea life from a variety of depth and rays ."], "human": ["It is one of the symbols of Hong Kong Ocean Park .", "It is the largest aquarium in the world .", "It allows visitors to watch sea life from all angles ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
