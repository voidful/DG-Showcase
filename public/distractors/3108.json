{"id": "3108", "article": "A unique thermo - solar power station Germasolar in southern Spain can work even on cloudy days : energy stored when the sun shines lets it produce electricity even during the night . It is the first solar power station in the world that works 24 hours a day ! This is how it works : the panels reflect the sun ' s rays onto the tower , transmitting energy 1 , 000 times stronger than that of the sun ' s rays reaching the earth . Energy is stored in tanks , and then steam is produced before finally turned into electricity . It is the station ' s capacity to store plenty of energy that makes Gemasolar so different because it allows the plant to transmit power during the night , relying on energy it has gained during the day . Helped by the generous state aid , renewable energies have enjoyed a boom in Spain , the world number two in solar energy and the biggest wind power producer in Europe , ahead of Germany . For the Gemasolar solar product , foreign investors helped too : Torresol Energy is a joint enterprise between the Spanish engineering group Sener , which holds 60 percent , and Abu Dhabi - financed renewable energy firm Masdar . This type of station is expensive , not because of the raw material we use , which is free solar energy , but because of the enormous investment these plants require . The investment cost is over 200 million euros ( $ 260 million ) . But the day when the business has repaid that money to the banks ( maybe , in 18 years , someone estimates ) , this station will become a 1 , 000 - euro note printing machine ! For now , the economic crisis has nevertheless cast a shadow over this kind of project : Spain is battling to cut its deficit as it slides into a difficult time and has cancelled aid to new renewable energy projects .", "questions": "What is NOT the reason for this power station being unique ?", "options": {"model": ["it is the largest solar power station in the world .", "it is the first solar power station in europe .", "it is the first solar power station which costs over 200 million euros ."], "human": ["It is the first solar power station in the world working around the clock .", "Its capacity to store energy is large .", "It is the first solar power station which costs over 200 million euros ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
