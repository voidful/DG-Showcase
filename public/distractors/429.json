{"id": "429", "article": "Chicago is considering firm measures to prevent the Asian carp , a giant fish native to the Far East , from coming into North America ' s Great Lakes in large numbers . Such a move could cost up to $ 18bn , a heavy economic burden to the city . This species , more than a metre in length , was originally introduced to southern US states three decades ago to control weeds in sewage treatment plants . But they escaped into the Mississippi River and increased in number quickly , making their way north towards the Great Lakes and threatening the native fish species along the way . \" Dozens of them will often leap out of the water as boats approach . ' ' Michael Beecham , a local environmental expert , described how frightening the scene was . \" I ' ve gone down the river and seen these fish jump up and hit me in the face . It is a big problem for our native species , \" he said . A meeting has been organized to find a technological solution to the carp problem , one of which involves blocking parts of Chicago ' s canal system . Listening at the meeting was John Goss , who was worried about the effect that having barriers in the canal system would have on industry . \" It would certainly increase the cost of transportation , \" he told . \" It is currently very cheap and efficient to bring materials and finished goods down the Chicago ship canal . ' ' Another cheaper option is to eat the fish out of existence . Dirk Fucik is selling carp burger at his fish shop not far from downtown Chicago . He thinks the carps are a great resource . \" To catch it and throw it away is a waste , \" he says . \" Eating them helps solve the problem and also provides jobs . \" But the idea has not yet caught on . So far , he is the only person in Chicago selling carp burgers .", "questions": "What ' s the best title of the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["chicago helps solve the problem of carp problem", "how to protect the asian carp", "chicago goes to war with asian carps", "chicago helps solve the problem of carps"], "human": ["The Great Lakes , new home for Asian Carps", "The Asian carp escapes from the Great Lakes", "Possible ways to handle non - native species", "Chicago goes to war with Asian carps"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
