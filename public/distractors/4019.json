{"id": "4019", "article": "On an August afternoon last year , Pamela Rivers , 40 , and her friend Rita Graham , 38 , were stopped at a red light on Cobb ' s Creek Parkway in South Philadelphia when a white SUV traveling in the opposite direction turned across traffic in front of them . It then jumped the curb and rushed through a grassy expanse before plunging down an embankment toward Cobb ' s Creek . Pamela quickly pulled over , jumped out of her car , and dialed 911 . Kenny Gibson , 23 , and his friend Taron Green , 25 , were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down . Kenny stopped , and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff . The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water . A woman ' s leg could be seen swinging out the driver ' s side window . \" I have a fear of water , \" Kenny said now . \" I almost drowned when I was nine . \" Even so , he and Taron hurried down the 50 - foot embankment into the muddy water . \" I could n ' t just leave her , \" he adds . The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman , Cheryl Allison , 61 , was partially in water . Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door . Then he broke the window . But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl , he found she was trapped by the seat belt . \" Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter , \" Kenny yelled to Taron . Meanwhile , Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl . That ' s when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site . \" I flipped into rescue mode , \" he said . When Taron returned , Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter . He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out , but she would n ' t come out . Marcell broke the rear window with a rock , hoping to rescue her from the back . Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt . Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two . Kenny leaned in , grabbed Cheryl by the waist , and pulled her out feet first . Marcell grasped Cheryl ' s legs , and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock . \" Give her CPR ! \" Pamela yelled down to them . But the two men had no idea what to do . \"", "questions": "Kenny is afraid of water because", "options": {"model": ["he could n ' t wait to walk into the", "he could n ' t wait to get on well", "once he narrowly missed drowning"], "human": ["The water was too deep", "the water was too muddy", "once he narrowly missed drowning"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
