{"id": "5258", "article": "Today our lives are changing faster than at any time in history . Here we report on three important changes that will have a big impact on our everyday lives in the future . The cashless society Cash and bank - notes will disappear almost completely . They will be replaced by smart cards , namely plastic cards : microchip processors loaded with some money . When we pay for goods , the shop assistant will put our smart card into a payment terminal and money will come into his card from our card . When all the money is used up , we will be able to reloadit by putting it into a telephone , dialing our bank account and money will be put into the card from the account . Interactive telephones Talking computers will play an important part . They will recognize speech , ask us what information we need , look through a database , and put the information into speech . If we want to book a flight or pay a bill by phone , we will interact with a talking computer to do so . Human telephone operators will be used only for more complex operations such as dealing with complaints or solving special problems . Traffic jams in cities will be reduced because drivers will use electronic route maps to find the quickest route to their destination . Electronic systems will start changing motorists for driving in cities . As soon as motorists have to pay to drive in cities , they will stop using their cars and use public transport instead . Speed control systems will be built into cars . These systems will automatically regulate the speed of the car to take account of traffic and weather conditions and prevent accidents . It will be many years before these changes bring results but when they do , there will be a _ improvement in road safety . With the development of science and technology , more and more advanced things will be invented or created . Life in the future is undoubtedly different from that at the present .", "questions": "Cash and bank - note will disappear because", "options": {"model": ["they wo n ' t be able to use any money", "they will be replaced by plastic cards convenient to use"], "human": ["we can load money from the bank", "they will be replaced by plastic cards convenient to use"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
