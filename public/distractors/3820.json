{"id": "3820", "article": "A board game is a game played on a pre - marked surface or \" board \" according to a set of rules . Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history . Do you think of yourself as a bit of an expert at board games like chess or Go ? Maybe you ' re not quite as good as you think . New research from the University of Manchester and Oxford suggests complex games like these are impossible to learn fully . They may even be too complex for the human mind to understand . Researchers studied two - player games , to try and understand the strategies which people use to make decisions during the game . Some games with two players are simple , with only a small number of possible moves . Players can quickly work out the best strategy but that means the game soon becomes boring . It gets more interesting when there are many possible moves . That ' s why people are so fascinated by complex board games like chess or Go , or some card games . But what the researchers found was that with difficult games , players find it hard to work out the best strategy and their actions become less reasonable . This research is part of the field called game theory : the study of human strategic decision - making . Much thinking on how people play complex games is based on something called \" the balance point \" , which is when players have a perfect knowledge of what they are going to do and of what their rivals are going to do . When you add more than two players then of course the game becomes even harder to understand . Trading on the stock market is an example of a complex multi - player game .", "questions": "It can be inferred in the passage that", "options": {"model": ["games with only a small number of possible moves can work out the best plan", "playing board games is a game played on a pre - painted surface", "games with only two players are difficult to understand", "players are easy to lose patience when in difficult games"], "human": ["the simpler the board game is , the better it is", "people dislike board games for the complex moves", "it ' s possible for people to understand complex games thoroughly", "players are easy to lose patience when in difficult games"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
