When Micheal began a story I was sure he had told before , I gave him a kick under the table . There was no response , so I gave him another kick . Still the story went on . Suddenly he stopped and said with a smile , \" Oh , but I ' ve told you this one before , have n ' t I ? \" We all chuckled and changed the subject . Later , on the dance floor , I asked my husband why it had taken him so long to get my message . \" What do you mean ? \" he replied . \" I cut off the story as soon as you kicked me . \" \" But I kicked you twice , and it still took you a while to stop ! \" Suddenly we realized what had happened and returned to our table . The boss smiled and said , \" Do n ' t worry . After the second one I thought it was n ' t for me , so I passed it along ! \"", "questions": "It took Micheal so long to stop his story because", "options": {"model": ["he got a kick only after a long while", "he could n ' t stand his boss ' s words", "he did n ' t think it was for him"], "human": ["he did n ' t understand at once why he was kicked", "the two kicks given were not heavy enough", "he got a kick only after a long while"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
