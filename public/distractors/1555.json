{"id": "1555", "article": "Once when I was facing a decision that involved high risk , I went to a friend . He looked at me for a moment , and then wrote a sentence containing the best advice I ' ve ever had : Be bold and brave - - and mighty forces will come to your aid . Those words made me see clearly that when I had fallen short in the past , it was seldom because I had tried and failed . It was usually because I had let fear of failure stop me from trying at all . On the other hand , whenever I had plunged into deep water , forced by courage or circumstance , I had always been able to swim until I got my feet on the ground again . Boldness means a decision to _ . And there is nothing mysterious about the mighty forces . They are potential powers we possess : energy , skill , sound judgment , creative ideas - - even physical strength greater than most of us realize . Admittedly , those mighty forces are spiritual ones . But they are more important than physical ones . A college classmate of mine , Tim , was an excellent football player , even though he weighed much less than the average player . \" In one game I suddenly found myself confronting a huge player , who had nothing but me between him and our goal line , \" said Tim . \" I was so frightened that I closed my eyes and desperately threw myself at that guy like a bullet - - and stopped him cold . \" Boldness - - a willingness to extend yourself to the extreme - - is not one that can be acquired overnight . But it can be taught to children and developed in adults . Confidence builds up . Surely , there will be setbacks and disappointments in life ; boldness in itself is no guarantee of success . But the person who tries to do something and fails is a lot better off than the person who tries to do nothing and succeeds . So , always try to live a little bit beyond your abilities - - and you ' ll find your abilities are greater than you ever dreamed .", "questions": "Why was the author sometimes unable to reach his goal in the past ?", "options": {"model": ["he did n ' t think it was necessary to try .", "fear prevented him from trying ."], "human": ["He lacked mighty forces .", "Fear prevented him from trying ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
