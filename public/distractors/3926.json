If you hate people throwing things on the ground , you might think , \" That person should n ' t litter . \" If you are a smoker , you might think , \" I would sure like a cigarette right now . \" Most likely , though , you are not thinking , \" That unused cigarette butt could be used to make something amazing ! \" That is , unless you are a creative scientist . If you are , you may see potential - - a possibility - - where others simply see trash . That is just what has happened in South Korea . The spirit of invention can hit at the strangest times and in the most unusual places . In South Korea , it happened near a trash can . Kin Gil - Pyo is with the Seoul National University . He says he saw people throwing away cigarette butts , which got him thinking . He began wondering if something useful could be made from them . He and other researchers found a way to convert cigarette butts into materials required for high - performance batteries . Kim Gil - Pyo says they looked closely at used cigarette filters , the parts of cigarettes smokers put into their mouths . Filters are made of a material called \" cellulose acetate . \" Mr . Kim explains that cellulose acetate can be made into another material : carbon . The pieces of cellulose acetate , known as fibers , are changed through a one - step burning process . After this , they are turned into an energy storage material . But why use carbon ? Carbon has many qualities that seem to make it the perfect material . Carbon has a high surface area . It conducts electricity well . It also stays stable , unlikely to change , for a long time . And carbon does not cost a lot . All these qualities make it the most popular material for making super - capacitors . Super - capacitors are good at storing energy . They have high - power mass , or density . They require only a short time for recharging . And they have a long lifecycle . Super - capacitors are used in products such as laptop computers and cell phones . They are also used in industrial energy converters , like wind turbine machines . Combining carbon and super - capacitors seems like a perfect marriage .
