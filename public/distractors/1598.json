{"id": "1598", "article": "Online clothes shoppers will be told exactly what size is best . for them using new software which combines with their web camera or smart phone to form a \" 3D tape measure \" . Scientists from Surrey University and design experts from the London College of Fashion are developing a program which can take precise waist , hip , chest and other measurements from camera images . Using the person ' s height as a starting point , the software will be able to build up a 3D image and estimate their size at various different points on the body , based on their overall proportions . The result will be a more accurate sizing guide than previous systems based on waist size or a \" small / medium / large \" scale , which rely on limited measurements and the buyer ' s perception of their own body size . Shoppers and retailers who choose to sign up for the project could save millions of pounds a year in postage costs by removing the need to order multiple sizes of the same garment and send back ill - fitting clothes , researchers claimed . The project , sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , is expected to be brought to market within two years . After choosing an item , the shopper will activate the software , enter their height , stand in front of their webcam or smart phone in their underwear and take a photograph . The software will not store or transmit the image to the internet , but will use it to judge the person ' s dimensions at various points on their body . Philip Delamore of the London College of Fashion said : \" The potential benefits for the fashion industry and for shoppers are huge . Currently , it ' s common for online shoppers to order two or three different sizes of the same item of clothing at the same time , as they ' re unsure which one will fit best . \"", "questions": "What can we learn about the 3D tape measure ?", "options": {"model": ["it will be designed for the fashion industry .", "it will be a co - working production .", "it can be found by online shoppers .", "it can be taken by the shopper ."], "human": ["It will store or transmit the image to the internet .", "It is based on the buyer ' s perception of their size .", "It uses a person ' s weight as a starting point .", "It will be a co - working production ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
