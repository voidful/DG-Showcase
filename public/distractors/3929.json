{"id": "3929", "article": "Tests administered to most elementary and high - school students in the United States exert an unfavorable influence on science and math teaching , according to a new $ 1 million study performed for the National Science Foundation . And because schools with high minority enrollments generally place a greater reliance on scores from these tests , the study finds , there tends to be \" a gap in instructional emphases between high and low minority classrooms that differs from our national concern for the quality of education . \" George F . Madaus and his colleagues at Boston College analyzed not only the six most widely used national standardized tests , but also the tests designed to accompany ( go with ) the four most commonly used science and math texts in fourth - grade , eighth - grade , and high - school classrooms . Though curriculum ( teaching program ) experts argue that schools should place greater emphasis on problem solving and reasoning , the new study shows that the tests focus on lower - level skills - - primarily mechanical memorization of routine formulas . Researchers surveyed more than 2 , 200 math and science instructors , interviewing in depth some 300 teachers and administrators . Especially in schools with high minority enrollments , teachers reported feeling pressured to help students perform well on these tests . Some states judge schools and some schools determine teacher assignments based on students ' test scores . \" With so much worry , \" Madaus says , \" teachers feel forced to focus their instruction on drilling what the tests will measure - - at the expense of the more valuable , higher - level skills . \"", "questions": "It can be inferred that in high minority classrooms", "options": {"model": ["teaching does n ' t focus on the quality of education", "students do n ' t have a good command of school education", "the teachers are pressured to help students perform well"], "human": ["the students can not get high score from the tests", "scores from the tests are not important", "teaching does n ' t focus on the quality of education"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
