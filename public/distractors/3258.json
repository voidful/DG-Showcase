You know , I shared a room with my sister in the old flat . But now I have my own bedroom ! It is small but it ' s my favorite room ! I can be alone in it . I can read books , draw pictures , listen to my radio and play CDs . I can also play games on my computer and send e - mails to my friends . I also love the new bigger kitchen . I love helping my mother with our meals . Mom cooks well . She always teaches me how to make different kinds of dishes . She lived in China when she was young , so she can cook Chinese food . It ' s delicious . Write to me soon and tell me about your home . Please get on the Internet so that we can chat with each other .
