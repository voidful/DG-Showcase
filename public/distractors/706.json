{"id": "706", "article": "My grandfather was a teacher . He was the headmaster of a school for boys between the ages of thirteen and eighteen . I know that he was a kind and gentle man at heart , because when I was young ( and he was old ) , he gave me presents and seated me on his knees , and told me stories . But I believe the boys at his school were afraid of him . At school , when he walked into a classroom full of noisy boys , those boys went red in the faces , and looked down at their shoes . If a boy brought his poor , careless work , which was not the best that boy could do , my grandfather picked up the boy ' s work and threw it across the room , shouting , \" Do it all again , and bring it back early tomorrow morning ! \" If the boy was late , or if he forgot to bring the work , he had to do it again . My grandfather never forgot . He was a very different man at school , from the man I saw day by day in his own home .", "questions": "I knew my grandfather was kind and gentle , because", "options": {"model": ["he gave me presents and told me stories", "he told me stories"], "human": ["he was the headmaster of a school for boys", "he gave me presents and told me stories"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
