{"id": "514", "article": "Once I mentioned the story of a friend getting something made for me to give my daughter as a present , and then not letting me pay her back . Writing about that made me think about the problem of communicating feelings , particularly in cross - cultural situations . Let me explain . If I say to a fellow English - speaker , \" I know how you feel , \" what I am actually saying is that I can imagine myself in the same position , and therefore can imagine how I would feel . But my friend could perfectly correctly reply , \" No , you do n ' t ! You ca n ' t . \" In truth we can communicate how strongly we feel , but we can not communicate exactly what we feel . But if we come from the same linguistic and cultural background , the match can be close enough . Culture and language can not be separated , and I think that we have the feelings that are recognized in our culture and therefore represented in our language . One might say that we feel the things that our language allows us to express . So when it comes to trying to explain feelings to someone of a different mother tongue , the difficulties are huge . I could not explain to my friend how I felt about her not letting me repay her , because Chinese culture , it seems , does not recognize the same feelings on such occasions . She could understand the words that I was using , but could not understand what I was trying to say . Some time ago , I was going up in the lift , and a colleague with whom I merely have a nodding acquaintance was offering round some sweetmeat . I knew that I really could not eat it , so I refused politely , only to be told that I was making her lose face . I have no idea how serious the colleague was being . Causing someone to lose face is a serious social mistake . We have to do all we can to learn the types of situation in which it happens , and to try to avoid them . But we can only know about losing face , we ca n ' t feel losing face , as the term is merely a literal translation of Chinese , not one that is native to English .", "questions": "This passage is focused on", "options": {"model": ["cultural differences between the east and the west", "the relationship between different cultures", "different cultural background between the west and the west"], "human": ["how to avoid making people lose face", "how to be acquainted with Chinese culture", "cultural differences between the east and the west"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
