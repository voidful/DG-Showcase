{"id": "2067", "article": "Even as Google plans to test its fleet of self - driving cars on public roads this summer , its business model remains a bit of a mystery . By 2025 , as many as 250 , 000 self - driving vehicles could be sold each year globally , according to a study by an industry research firm . \" Vehicles that can take anyone from A to B at the push of a button could transform mobility for millions of people , \" said Chris Urmson , director of Google ' s self - driving car project . For now , Google has no plans to sell any of its self - driving cars . They are strictly for research . But they will hit public roads this summer near Google ' s headquarters in Mountain View , California . Previous testing has taken place only on closed courses . The cars are built to operate without a steering wheel , accelerator or brake pedal . \" Our software and sensors do all the work , \" Urmson said . \" The vehicles will be very basic - - we want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible - - but they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button . \" The prototype are the first of a 100 - car fleet the tech giant is building . In the long run , Urmson sees a future of safer roads - - the majority of auto accidents are caused by human error - - and fewer traffic jams . Robotic cars could also shuttle people who ca n ' t drive because of age or illness . Google has said that self - driving cars could launch new business models in which people buy the use of vehicles they do n ' t own . The company has already tested other types of self - driving cars on public streets , including modified Lexus sport - utility vehicles , under a special permit program by the California Department of Motor Vehicles that requires a human driver at the controls . The state has issued six other companies permits to operate such cars , including Delphi , Mercedes - Benz , Volkswagen , Tesla , Bosch and Nissan . The vehicles that will be tested on open roads this summer will have removable steering wheels , accelerators and brake pedals to allow \" safety drivers \" to take control if needed . Google says the cars are safe . The vehicles have sensors that \" can detect objects", "questions": "According to Chris Urmson ,", "options": {"model": ["software and sensors are vital for self - driving cars", "self - driving cars will be popular", "self - driving cars can be used in the market", "self - driving cars will be widely used"], "human": ["self - driving cars can give driving orders to humans", "self - driving cars are specially designed for the elderly", "ordinary vehicles will be replaced by self - driving cars", "software and sensors are vital for self - driving cars"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
