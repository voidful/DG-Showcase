What made Europeans believe this was John Gerard ' s publication of Herbal in 1597 . Gerard wrote : \" The leaves and stalks of the tomato plant are toxic . \" Undoubtedly , Gerard ' s opinion was based on a misunderstanding of tomatoes . But his opinion was widely spread in Britain and North America for over two hundred years . In the late 1700s , a lot of Europeans held more fears for tomatoes . A nick name for the fruit was \" poison apple \" because it was believed that aristocrats got sick and died after eating them . But the actual reason was the pewter plates they used . Since tomatoes are high in acidity , when placed on the plates , the lead in the plates would dissolve . This caused many deaths . Unluckily , no one knew this at that time . So the innocent tomatoes were picked as the killer . Today , more than one and a half billion tons of tomatoes are produced every year around the world . Tomatoes are cooked in various ways . This healthy and tasty food finally wins its innocence back .", "questions": "Which of the following can be the best title for this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the relationship between tomatoes and food", "the bad effects of tomatoes", "europeans ' fears for tomatoes", "the tomatoe"], "human": ["History of tomato planting", "Why do people eat so many tomatoes", "How did the tomato prove its value", "Europeans ' fears for tomatoes"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
