{"id": "3466", "article": "Dear SJ , Losing a best friend is never easy . Your problem , is not just that you miss your best friend , it is that you feel empty and lost without her friendship . It takes time to get over a lost , and during that time , your mind is getting used to _ . This is usually a good thing , even if it feels like a bad thing . Now that you are on your own , you are being forced to learn to be by yourself and to rely upon your own inner voice for guidance . I am sure that this feels strange for you , but if you can hang on for a bit longer , it may work to your advantage . Best friends are cool , but it is important to know the difference between missing someone and being too independent upon them . At your age , girls do tend to stick together and having a good boyfriend may not yet be the better choice . Your friend is leaving you , her best friend , for a boyfriend . Boyfriends are completely different from best friends . The distinction is that boyfriends come and go , while girl friends often stay in your life throughout high school , and even afterwards . It is a completely different sort of bond . I suggest that you take advantage of this period in your life to expand your horizons . Enjoy the freedom of having no best friend for a while , and hang with the group . By the time your former best friend breaks up with her boyfriend , you will be in a completely different place , a far better place . And , by the way , next time you feel empty and lost , try to write about it in a diary . In several months , you will look back and read it with curiosity about yourself . \" Who was I then , and what could I have been thinking ? \"", "questions": "The writer believes by the time SJ ' s former friend loses her boyfriend , SJ will", "options": {"model": ["feel more independent and confident", "have a better friend", "find it difficult to find a good friend", "not be able to get over a lost"], "human": ["take revenge on her former friend", "comfort her former friend", "continue friendship with her former friend", "feel more independent and confident"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
