He killed himself when I was three years old , leaving mom with the job of raising nine kids . She was a very hard worker , and in order to make ends meet , she hardly ever rested . With my mom as my example , I learned that hard work is the best way to get what you want . Even as a little boy , I knew I was going to be successful . Regardless of what I chose , I wanted to make my brothers , sisters and mom proud of me - - not only by being successful in what I chose to do , but also as a person who could be looked up to for the right reasons . Surprising as it might seem , basketball was n ' t in my plans . One day , my mom cut a rim off an old water barrel and then held it up for me to throw an old rubber ball through . By junior high , I started playing basketball on a team . I loved to compete . For me , it paid off . I always put the effort in , every day . I am grateful for the life I ' ve enjoyed as a basketball star . Basketball is not life . It can be exciting . But the most important thing about basketball is that it gives me a way to do good things for others as I move through this journey called life .", "questions": "What does the author get from basketball ?", "options": {"model": ["how to do good things for others .", "how to be successful in what he chose to do ."], "human": ["Life is as hard as playing basketball .", "How to do good things for others ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
