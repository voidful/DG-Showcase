Once upon a time - - July 20 , 1969 , to be specific - two men got out of their little spaceship and wandered around on the moon for a while . Ten more men walked on the moon over the next three and a half years . The end . Unfortunately , not quite . A fair number of Americans think that this whole business of moon landings really is a fairy tale . They believe that the landings were a big hoax staged in the Mojave Desert , to convince everyone that U . S . technology was the \" best \" in the whole wide world . Which is the harder thing to do : Send men to the moon or make believe we did ? The fact is that the physics behind sending people to the moon is simple . You can do it with computers whose entire memory capacities can now fit on chips the size of postage stamps and that cost about as much as , well , a postage stamp . I know you can because we did . However , last fall NASA considered spending $ 15 , 000 on a public - relations campaign to convince the unimpressed that Americans had in fact gone to the moon . That idea was mostly a reaction to a Fox television program , first aired in February 2001 , that claimed to expose the hoax . The show ' s creator is a publicity hound who has lived up to the name in more ways than one by hounding Buzz Aldrin , the second man on the moon . Mr . X ( as I will call him , thereby denying him the joyous sight of his name in print ) recently followed Buzz Aldrin around and called him \" a thief , liar and coward \" until the 72 - year - old astronaut finally lost it and hit the 37 - year - old Mr . X in the face . Anyway , NASA ' s publicity campaign began to slow down . The nonbelievers took the campaign as NASA ' s effort to hide something while the believers said that $ 15 , 000 to convince people that the world was round - - I mean , that we had gone to the moon - - was simply a waste of money . ( Actually , the $ 15 , 000 was supposed to pay for an article by James E . Oberg , an astronomy writer who , with Aldrin , has contributed to Scientific American . ) If NASA ' s", "questions": "The believers think that NASA ' s publicity campaign is", "options": {"model": ["a waste of money for the", "stupid and unnecessary"], "human": ["needed to convince the non - believers", "stupid and unnecessary"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
