{"id": "3976", "article": "Like any awards ceremony of its age , the Oscars , now in its 85th year , has been trying hard to change . So how did that go this year ? When host Seth MacFarlane noted in his opening speech that it was the first time the Academy Awards had a theme , I thought : \" well , that ' s a good start . \" But when he revealed that the theme was a tribute to ( . . . ) musicals , I was less sure . After all , it ' s not the first time that musicals have featured at the Oscars . In 2007 , the cast of Dream - girls gave a special performance directed by movie director and musical veteran Bill Condon . Then there was the memorable 2009 show hosted by Hugh Jackman , who screams musicals . With Beyonce Knowles and Anne Hathaway , he performed several hit songs from move musical . And in 2010 , how did Neil Patrick Harris introduce the hosts ? By performing a musical number . So I guess the Oscars could have done better this year . But I must admit , there were more music performances in the three - and - a - half - hour show than ever before . This suggests the Oscars has dropped some of its arrogance and wants to offer audiences more entertainment . It ' s a timely move as the Golden Globes , also known as the \" big party , \" has become a threat to the Oscars , stealing viewers and even its reputation . Just look at the Oscars ' winning list this year . You ca n ' t blame the academy for wanting to stick it to the Golden Globes . While they hired Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to host the show - - certainly more audience - friendly than MacFarlane - - and Bill Clinton was invited as a presenter , who did viewers get at the Oscars ? The First Lady of the US , Michelle Obama . Way to go , Oscar ! We know you ' re struggling to look fresh and young , but do n ' t lose the pride and dignity that made you one biggest honor in the movie industry . Do n ' t ever let that change .", "questions": "What disappoints the writer is that", "options": {"model": ["the oscars have lost their popularity in the end", "the oscars has lost some pride and dignity to cater to the audiences", "the oscars have lost their respect for the audience"], "human": ["the Oscars did n ' t invite Bill Clinton as a presenter", "the Oscars is no longer fresh and young", "the Oscars has lost some pride and dignity to cater to the audiences"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
