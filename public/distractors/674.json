{"id": "674", "article": "A campaign is being launched to encourage children to _ 30 minutes of screen time a day to head for the great outdoors . The newly formed Wild Network - - a collaboration of nearly 400 organizations - - is attempting to attract youngsters away from television and computer screen and to fields , woods and parks . Members of the network include the National Trust , RSPB , Play England and the NHS . Organizers say it is the UK ' s biggest ever campaign to reconnect children with nature and outdoor play , and claim it could help improve fitness , mental alertness and general wellbeing . A documentary film , Project Wild Thing , will forecast the launch at more than 50 cinemas across the UK from Friday . It looks at the increasing link between children and nature . Andy Simpson , chairman of the Wild Network , said , \" The tragic truth is that kids have lost touch with nature and the outdoors in just one generation . Time spent outdoors is down , roaming ranges have fallen largely , activity levels are declining and the ability to identify common species has been lost . \" Suggestions of how to get more time in nature include collecting conkers , camping or snail racing , and observing autumn colour on trees . From January , the network will aim to make suggestions to politicians on how government can do more to get children muddy and bright - eyed . This is not the first time the message of less screen , more play has been brought up . Children in the 1980s were requested to do the same by the BBC TV series Why Do n ' t You , which somewhat confusingly called on its viewers to \" switch off your TV set and go to do something less boring instead \" .", "questions": "Which is confusing according to the passage ?", "options": {"human": ["Government took measures to get children muddy and bright - eyed .", "More children went out to keep in touch with nature .", "Wild Network launched a campaign to encourage children to go outdoors .", "A BBC TV series called on its viewers to shut off their TV sets ."]}, "answer": {"human": 3}}
