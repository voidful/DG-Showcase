{"id": "2675", "article": "Shundagarh is a village on India ' s east - facing coast . It is a village of simple mud and grass houses built on the beach just above the waterline . The Khadra Hills rise immediately behind the village , to a height of one hundred and fifty meters . A simple , good - hearted old man , whose name was Jalpur , farmed two small fields on the very edge of these hills . From his fields he could see the fishing boats that traveled up and down the coast . He could see the children playing on the sands ; their mothers washing clothes on the flat stones where the Shiva River flowed into the sea ; and their fathers landing the latest catch or repairing nets and telling stories that had no end . All Jalpur owned in the world were the clothes he wore day in and day out , the miserable hut that he slept in at night , a few tools and cooking pots - and his fields . The corn that he grew was all that made life possible . If the weather was kind and the harvest was good , Jalpur could live happily enough - not well , but happily . When the sun was fierce , and there was little or no rain , then he came close to the line between life and death . Last year the weather had been so kind , and the harvest promised to be so good , that Jalpur had been wondering whether he could sell all that he had and live with his son farther up the coast . He had been thinking about doing this for some years . It was his dearest wish to spend his last days with his son and his wife . But he would go only if he could give ; he would not go if it meant taking food out of the mouths of his grandchildren . He would rather die hungry than do this . On the day when Jalpur decided that he would harvest his corn , sell it , and move up the coast , he looked out to the sea and saw a huge wave , several kilometers out , advancing on the coast and on the village of Shundagarh . Within ten minutes everyone in Shundagarh would be drowned . Jalpur would have shouted , but the people were too far away to hear . He would have run down the hill , but he was too old to run . He was prepared", "questions": "The villagers were thankful to Jalpur because he had", "options": {"model": ["saved all the houses on the coast", "given his life in order to save theirs", "lived far away from the village on the island", "been asked to take good care of his son and wife"], "human": ["given them his corn in order to save them from hunger", "saved their village from being drowned by the wave", "given them many things during his life", "given his life in order to save theirs"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
