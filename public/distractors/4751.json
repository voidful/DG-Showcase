Some students are playing computer games . Some students are watching movies on computers . My new friends , Peter and Bill , are here with me . Peter is buying a T - shirt on the Internet . And what is Bill doing ? Oh , he is reading a book on the computer . They ' re friendly and they often help me with my study and life . When you come to Shanghai , I want you to meet them . I ' m OK in Shanghai . Please do n ' t worry about me . I hope you are happy and well .
