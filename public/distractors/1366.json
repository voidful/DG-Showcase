{"id": "1366", "article": "If parents had job descriptions , mine would read : organize bills , playmates , laundry ( washing clothes ) , meals , snacks , outings and shopping . The only thing on my husband ' s description would be the word \" fun \" written in big red letters along the top . Although he is a selfless provider , our children think of him more as a combination of a jungle gym and a clown . Our parenting styles complement each other . His style is a nonstop adventure where no one has to worry about washing their hands or eating vegetables . I ' m too busy worrying to be fun . Even if I try , I know I will be outdone by my husband . I bought my children bubble gum flavored toothpaste to teach them how to brush their teeth . They thought it was perfect until my husband taught them how to spit out water between their two front teeth like a fountain . I took the children on a walk in the woods and caught a ladybug ( small insect ) . I was \" cool \" until their father caught a giant beetle in the backyard . I can make sure my children are safe . But I ca n ' t wire the TV so they can watch their favorite DVD . I can carry my children in my arms when they are tired and kiss them goodnight . But I ca n ' t flip them upside down so they can walk on the ceiling or put them on my shoulders so they can see the moths flying around the ceiling light . I can take them to doctor ' s appointments , scout meetings , or to the aquarium . But I ' ll never go into the wilderness , stick a worm onto a hook , catch a fish , and cook it over an open flame . I ' ll sit in the first row of every sports game and cheer until my throat is painful . But I ' ll never teach my son how to hit a home run or slide into first base . As a mother I can do a lot of things for my children . But no matter how hard I try , I can never be their father .", "questions": "Which of the following is true about the author ' s husband ?", "options": {"model": ["he often plays with his children .", "he does more exciting activities with the children .", "he teaches the children how to wash their teeth .", "he likes to play with the children ."], "human": ["He is as cool as the author in the children ' s eyes .", "He loves adventure even if it is dangerous for the children .", "He does n ' t spend as much time as the author does with the children .", "He does more exciting activities with the children ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
