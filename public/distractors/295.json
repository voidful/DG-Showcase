{"id": "295", "article": "Summer Rain The worst days of any summer are the rainy ones . We spend all year looking forward to nice weather and long , hot days . All of winter , with its cloudy days and bitter cold , we dream of those endless days at the beach , lying on the sand and enjoying the bright and burning sun . And then , summer comes , and it rains . As a child , I would wake up to rainy summer days and come close to crying . It was n ' t fair . We suffered through months of school and experienced bad weather for those short ten weeks of freedom and pleasant weather . On those rainy summer days , I had nothing fun to do and could only sit inside , staring out at the rain like a bird in a cage . I was an only child , so there was no one else to play with . My father worked from home , so I was not truly alone , but he could not actively play with me since he was at work . It was those days that I would watch whatever was on television or read any books that I could find lying around . I ' d drag through the day and pray each night that the rain would not be there the next day . As an adult , though , my opinion of summer rain has changed . When you have to work every day , summer is not as exciting . Everything seems dull . Such a mindset makes you cheer for anything new or different . I spend the winter dreaming of summer and the summer dreaming of winter . When summer comes , I hate how hot it is . And then I look forward to the rain , because the rain brings with it a cold front , which makes me comfortable . Rainy days are still the worst days of the summer , but summer rain today means positively beautiful - - and considerably cooler - - weather tomorrow .", "questions": "As an adult , the author views summer rain differently because", "options": {"model": ["rain makes the weather cooler", "the rain makes the weather warmer"], "human": ["his summer holiday is very short", "rain makes the weather cooler"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
