{"id": "5673", "article": "The U . S . Department of Labor statistics show that there is an oversupply of college trained workers and that this oversupply is increasing . Already there have been more than enough teachers , engineers , physicists , aerospace experts , and other specialists . Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that are n ' t there . The result is that graduates can not enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree . On the other hand , there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts : carpenters , electricians , mechanics , plumbers , TV repairmen . These people have more work than they can deal with , and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates . The old gap that white - - collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true . The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen . The reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future . A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree . Parents begin indoctrinating their children with this myth before they are out of grade school . High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life . Under this pressure the kids fall in line . Whether they want to go to college or not does n ' t matter . Everybody should go to college , so of course they must go . And every year college enrollments go up and up , and more and more graduates are overeducated for the kinds of jobs available to them . One result of this emphasis on a college education is that _ . Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college , half of them do not graduate with their class . Many of them drop out within the first year . Some struggle on for two or three years and then give up .", "questions": "It ' s implied but not stated in the passage that", "options": {"model": ["white - collar workers in the us have higher income than white - collar workers in america", "white - collar workers in the us used to make more money than blue - collar workers", "the workers in the us have higher income than those in the us"], "human": ["fewer students will prefer to go to college in the future", "the law of supply and demand has a strong effect on American higher education", "white - collar workers in the US used to make more money than blue - collar workers"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
