{"id": "845", "article": "Here in the northeast Georgia mountains live an old man and his young grandson . A small sum of money given by the government is their only regular income . Man and boy walk up and down the highway daily collecting soft - drink bottles for resale . I stopped once , and tried to give the man a carton of empty bottles . Polite , but firmly , he refused my \" charity \" . Exercising what I thought was the only reasonable matter . I was driving their part of road , throwing bottles out of the car window , when the flashing blue light of a Georgia State Patrol car filled my mirror . I took my lecture on litter laws , and then told the officer about the man and the boy . We could see the old man from where we were stopped , bending over to pick up a bottle . The officer warned me again , and told me to move on . As we both pulled onto the road , I looked in my mirror just in time to see two bottles sail out of the passenger window of the patrol car and land unbroken on the grass .", "questions": "The man ' s refusal to take the box of empty bottles from the writer shows that", "options": {"model": ["poor as he was , he did n ' t want to be pitied", "he did n ' t like the old man ' s \" charity \""], "human": ["he collected the empty bottles only for fun", "poor as he was , he did n ' t want to be pitied"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
