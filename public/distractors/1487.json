{"id": "1487", "article": "My brother - in - law opened the bottom drawer of my sister ' s bureau and picked out a wonderful skirt . \" Jan bought this the first time we went to New York , at least 8 or 9 years ago . She never wore it . She was saving it for a special occasion . \" Well , I guess this is the occasion . He took the skirt from me and put it on the bed . His hands touched the soft material for a moment , then he shut the drawer and turned to me , \" Do n ' t ever save anything for a special occasion . Every day you ' re alive is a special occasion . \" I ' m still thinking about his words , and they ' ve changed my attitude to life . I ' m spending more time with my family and friends and less time in committee meetings . Whenever possible , life should be a pattern of experience to enjoy , not suffer . I ' m trying to recognize these moments now and treasure them . \" Someday \" and \" one of these days \" are being lost from my vocabulary . If it ' s worth seeing or hearing or doing , I want to see and hear and do it now . I ' m not sure what my sister would have done if she had known she would n ' t have tomorrow . I think she would have called family members and a few close friends . She might have called a few former friends to apologize and mend her fences for past things . I like to think she would have gone out for a Chinese dinner , her favorite food . If I knew that my hours were limited , those little things left undone would make me angry . Angry because I put off seeing good friends whom I was going to get in touch with someday . Angry and sorry because I did n ' t tell my husband and daughter often enough how much I truly love them . I ' m trying very hard not to put off , hold back , or save anything that would add laughter to our lives . And every morning when I open my eyes , I tell myself that every day , every minute , and every breath truly , is . . . a gift from God .", "questions": "What ' s the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["every day is a gift", "a gift from god"], "human": ["Every day is an important occasion", "Every day is a gift"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
