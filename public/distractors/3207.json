{"id": "3207", "article": "Happiness pays off , studies show . Psychologists seeking the real secrets of happiness report that very happy people tend to be more _ and agreeable than less happy people . \" Our findings suggest that very happy people have rich and satisfying social relationships and spend little time alone compared to average people , \" write psychologists Ed Diener and Martin E . P . Seligman in the journal Psychological Science . Solid social relationships do not promise happiness , but they are an important contributing factor . The very happy people whom the authors studied all said they had good quality social relationships . However , the authors write , there is no single key to high happiness . \" High happiness seems to be like beautiful symphonic music - - including many instruments , without any one being enough for the beautiful quality . \" Diener regards happiness as \" subjective wellbeing \" - - in other words , the person evaluates his or her own quality of life . The question to ask is , \" Is my life going well , according to the standards I choose to use ? \" If the answer is \" yes \" , then that person is judged to be happy . Because people evaluate their lives based on happiness , subjective wellbeing is very important . Though necessary , it is not enough for having a good life . \" Subjective wellbeing seems quite necessary for the ' good society ' , although it is not enough for that society because there are other things we also value and would want in such a place . \" says Diener . Can subjective wellbeing be measured scientificall ? Diener points out three parts contributing to happiness : pleasant emotions and moods , lack of negative emotions and moods , and satisfaction judgment , to which other factors including cheerfulness and feelings of fulfillment may be added . There is no magic formula for happiness . Diener suggests steps you can take to ensure you are as happy as you can be . Surrounding yourself with good friends and family - - people who care about you and whom you care about - - is a start . Joining in activities you enjoy and value is also important ; whether it ' s work or play , keeping busy in an environment enjoyable to you will contribute much to your subjective wellbeing . In addition , a healthy outlook is necessary .", "questions": "According to Diener , a person can be judged to be happy when he", "options": {"model": ["has a good quality social relationships", "thinks his life is going well according to his own standards", "is satisfied with his own quality of life"], "human": ["has rich and satisfying social relationships", "spends more time with other people", "thinks his life is going well according to his own standards"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
