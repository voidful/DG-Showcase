{"id": "3481", "article": "It is widely acknowledged that it is by no means an easy task to bring up a child well . And our ancestors already understood it well . \" It takes an entire village to raise a child . \" That ' s an old proverb that is being quoted more and more often these days . And I ' m pleased about that . Today , more and more schools are reaching out to involve parents , community members and businesses to help shape a child ' s future . Parents need to be involved in their children ' s education in many ways . Helping children with homework and studying , going on a field trip , teaching a craft or coaching a child ' s sports team are all great ways to be involved with your child ' s education . And do n ' t forget to communicate with teachers - - they need and respect your input . Studies show that children learn more and schools function better when parents and schools work together . It ' s important to stay in touch with your child ' s education all through his or her school career . Communities can help children create and achieve new goals . Help with homework , read to a child , coach a children ' s team , or provide emotional support . Help solve problems and build self - esteem . Kids need role models and advisers can be role models by sharing their experiences and wisdom . Businesses can also help shape our children ' s future . invite a class from your local school to visit your workplace . You may be providing a glimpse that opens a new world of possibilities . Show students what goes on during a typical day . Give a mini course for students : how to use a computer ; how products are made ; how machinery works . You may have a developing electrician , teacher , nurse , or even a newspaper reporter on your hands . It really does take an entire village to raise a child . So share the responsibility - - and the joy - - of bringing a child to his or her full potential .", "questions": "Which of the following can be the main idea of idea text ?", "options": {"model": ["parents and schools are important for children ' s development .", "parents and other organizations should all be responsible for children ' s growth", "children should be taught to be involved in their education", "it ' s necessary to bring up a child ' s education"], "human": ["Parents play an important part in children ' s education .", "Communities have no effect on the way to new and high ideals .", "Businesses may arrange softie training courses for students .", "Parents and other organizations should all be responsible for children ' s growth"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
