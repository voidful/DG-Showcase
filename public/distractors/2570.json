{"id": "2570", "article": "Beauty has always been regarded as something admirable . Almost everyone thinks attractive people are happier and healthier , have better marriages and have more respectable jobs . Personal consultants give them better advice for finding jobs . Even judges are softer on attractive persons . But in the executive circle , beauty can become a liability . While attractiveness is a positive thing for a man ' s rise , it is harmful to a woman . Handsome male executives were considered as having more honesty than plainer men ; effort and ability were thought to be the reasons for their success . Attractive female executives were considered to have less honesty than unattractive ones ; their success was attributed not to ability but to factors such as luck . All unattractive women executives were thought to have more honesty and to be more capable than the attractive female executives . Why are attractive woman not thought to be able ? An attractive woman is thought to be more feminine and an attractive man more masculine than the less attractive ones . Thus , an attractive woman has an advantage in traditionally female jobs , but an attractive woman in a traditionally masculine position appears to lack the \" masculine \" qualities required . This is true even in politics . Anne Bowman recently published a study on the effects of attractiveness on political candidates . She asked 125 undergraduate students to rank two groups of photographs , one of men and one of women in order of attractiveness . The students were told the photographs were of candidates for political offices . They were asked lo rank them again , in the order they would vote for them . The results showed that attractive males completely defeated unattractive men , but the woman who had been ranked most attractive always received the fewest votes .", "questions": "The author writes this passage to", "options": {"model": ["discuss the negative aspects of being attractive", "explain the negative effects of attractiveness on political candidates", "criticize women ' s attitude towards attractive women"], "human": ["give advice to job - seekers who are attractive", "demand equal rights for women", "discuss the negative aspects of being attractive"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
