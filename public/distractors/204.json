Moss found buried beneath the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island in Canada has been brought back to life . Findings suggest that these plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps . Plants that were buried beneath thick ice in Canada more than 400 years ago and were thought to have frozen to death have been brought back to life by Canadian scientists . Samples of the moss plant , covered by the glacier during the Little Ice Age of 1550 to 1850 AD , were replanted in a lab at the University of Alberta and grew new stems . Researchers now think these findings can give indication as to how regions can recover as the ice covering them melts . Biologist Dr . Catherine La Farge and her team at the University of Alberta were exploring the region around the Teardrop glacier on Ellesmere Island . Ice on Ellesmere Island region has been melting at around four meters each year for the past nine years . This means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed . Many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the Little Ice Age between 1550 and 1850 AD can now be studied , including many species that have never been studied before . While examining an exposed area of land , La Farge and her team discovered a small area of moss called Aulacomnium turgidum . It is a type of bryophyte plant that mainly grows across Canada , the US and the Highlands of Scotland . Dr La Farge noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems , suggesting it is either growing again or can be encouraged to repopulate . Dr La Farge told the BBC , \" When we looked at the samples in detail and brought them to the lab , I could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green branches , suggesting that these plants are growing again , and that _ When we think of thick areas of ice covering the landscape , we ' ve always thought that plants have to come from refugia , never considering that land plants come from underneath a glacier . It ' s a whole world of what ' s coming out from underneath the glacier that really needs to be", "questions": "Dr La Farge ' s research is of great importance to", "options": {"model": ["understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers .", "studying the climate change of the earth .", "studying the climate change in the ice age ."], "human": ["knowing what the plants during the Little Ice Age were like", "figuring out the effects of melting ice caps on moss .", "understanding how ecosystems recover from glaciers ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
