{"id": "1696", "article": "The human body is designed to move . But modern lifestyles and office jobs rarely give us the chance to move around . As we know . we ' re while we ' re eating ; we sit in the car and we sit while we watch TV . And many of us sit for many hours at work . New research shows that sitting less than three hours a day might extend your life by two years . Peter Katzmarzyk , a scientist at the University of Louisiana in the southern United States , says that sitting is ubiquitous in our lives , meaning it is something we do all the time , everywhere . However , Mr . Katzmarzyk says that does not mean you can sit for the rest of your waking hours . He also says you may exercise often , \" We ca n ' t throw away physical activity . It ' s extremely important . We have 60 years of research showing us that . \" Mr . Katzmarzyk and his coi leagues are part of a new generation of researchers studying how sitting all day affects length of life . \" Studies that have assessed the relationship between sitting and mortality or television viewing and mortality are very rare . There ' s only been a few of them , actually five or six now , in the last four or five years . \" They found that cutting television time to less than two hours a day could add one - point four years to life . Luckily , change is already coming to some offices , especially in the design of desks . A \" standing desk \" lets people stand while they work . Another new design is called the \" treadmill desk . \" A treadmill is an exercise machine that lets you walk in one place . Even some U . S . schools are beginning to experiment with desks that are part bicycle to keep children moving . That ' s one of the strategies that many companies are using now . Mr . Katzmarzyk also says studying this problem has inspired his team to make a few changes in their own lives .", "questions": "Which view agrees with the opinion of Mr .
