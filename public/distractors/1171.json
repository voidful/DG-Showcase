{"id": "1171", "article": "Whether rich or poor , parents who have books in the home increase the level of education their children will attain , according to a 20 - year study led by Mariah Evans . For years , educators have thought the strongest predictor of attaining high levels of education was having parents who were highly educated . But , the study showed that the difference between being raised in a bookless home compared to being raised in a home with a 500 - book library has as great an effect on the level of education a child will attain as the difference between having parents who are barely literate and having parents who have a university education . Being a sociologist , Evans was particularly interested to find that children of lesser - educated parents benefit the most from having books in the home . What kinds of investments should we make to help these kids get ahead ? The results of this study indicate that getting some books into their homes is an inexpensive way that we can help these children succeed . Evans said , \" Even a little bit goes a long way . Having as few as 20 books in the home still has a significant impact on _ a child to a higher level of education , and the more books you add , the greater benefit the children get . \" The researchers were struck by the strong effect having books in the home had on children ' s educational attainment even above and beyond such factors as education level of the parents , the father ' s occupation or the economic level of the country . Having books in the home is twice as important as the father ' s education level , and more important than whether a child was brought up in a developing country or a developed country . Surprisingly , the difference in educational attainment for children born in developed country and children born in developing country was just 2 years , less than two - thirds of the effect that having 500 or more books in the home had on children .", "questions": "Which of the following has the most important effect on the level of education a child will attain ?", "options": {"model": ["having books in the home .", "have parents who have a university education .", "spending more books in the home ."], "human": ["The economic level of the country .", "Education levels of parents .", "Having books in the home ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
