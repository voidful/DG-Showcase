{"id": "3598", "article": "The knowledge society will be a highly competitive one , for organizations and individuals alike . Information technology , although only one of many new features of the next society , is already having one hugely important effect : it is allowing knowledge to spread near - instantly , and making it accessible to everyone . Given the ease and speed at which information travels , every institution in the knowledge society - - not only businesses , but also schools , universities , hospitals and increasingly government agencies too - - has to be globally competitive , even though most organizations will continue to be local in their activities and in their markets . This is because the Internet will keep customers everywhere informed on what is available anywhere in the world , and at what price . This new knowledge economy will rely heavily on knowledge workers . At present , this term is widely used to describe people with considerable theoretical knowledge and learning : doctors , lawyers , teachers , accountants chemical engineers . But the most striking growth will be in \" knowledge technologists \" : computer technicians , software designers , analysts in clinical labs , manufacturing technologists , paralegals . These people are as much manual workers and they are knowledge workers ; in fact , they usually spend far more time working with their hands than with their brains , but their manual work is based on a substantial amount of theoretical knowledge which can be acquired only through formal education , not through an apprenticeship . They are not , as a rule , much better paid than traditional skilled workers , but they see themselves as \" professionals \" , just as unskilled manual workers in manufacturing were the _ social and political force in the 21thcentury , knowledge technologists are likely to become the dominant social - - and perhaps also political - - force over the next decades .", "questions": "All of the following are characteristic of \" knowledge technologist \" except that", "options": {"model": ["they have a better job than traditional workers", "they have to work with their hands to teach their brains", "they spend much time working with their brains", "they acquire skills through traditional apprenticeship"], "human": ["they spend more time on manual work than on mental work", "they are equipped with a large amount of theoretical knowledge", "they see themselves professionals rather than traditional skilled workers .", "They acquire skills through traditional apprenticeship"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
