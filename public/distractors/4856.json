{"id": "4856", "article": "Long long ago , a donkey fell into a well . The animal cried for hours as the farmer tried to think out what to do . Finally , the farmer thought the animal was too old and the well needed to be covered up anyway , so he decided not to save the donkey . The farmer invited his neighbours to help him . They began to shovel dirt into the well . The donkey cried harder . But a few minutes later , he became quiet . The farmer looked into the well , and was surprised by what he saw . While every shovelful of dirt hit his back , the donkey would shake it off and take a step on the new layer of dirt . As the farmer ' s neighbours continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal , the donkey would shake it off and take another step up . Soon the donkey stepped up out of the well and ran away , to the surprise of all the neighbours . The lesson we get from this story is that if life shovels some dirt on us , we must get out the well and not let it cover us . We must learn to shake it off and take a step up . Each of our troubles is a stepping - stone . We can get out of the deepest well by never giving up !", "questions": "The farmer is", "options": {"model": ["ready to give up the donkey", "angry at the donkey ' s bad situation"], "human": ["kind to the donkey", "ready to give up the donkey"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
