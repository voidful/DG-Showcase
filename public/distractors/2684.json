{"id": "2684", "article": "Like people , plants experience stress . And also , like people , the response to that stress can determine success . Bad environmental conditions , such as drought , flood , heat and other stresses , affect yields more than crop pests and diseases . We are trying to find a way to equip plants with the ability to tolerate environmental stress and maintain high yields , said Stephen Howell , a professor of genetics and cell biology . Plant cells produce proteins and ship them to different parts of the cell . Under normal conditions , these proteins are folded into their normal , healthy structures as they are produced . When a plant is under stress , its cells produce poorly folded or unfolded proteins . Then a built - in system senses this and \" sets off an alarm in the cell , \" said Howell . In response to the alarm , another protein ( IRE1 ) starts working and creates a different process which activates the stress response genes whose products bring about defensive measures that help the plant survive . \" As it turns out , responses that are activated under stress conditions actually inhibit the growth of plants , \" said Howell . \" This allows them to preserve their energy to survive the stress conditions . \" For plants in the wild , this response is a help for survival , he said . In production of agriculture crops , however , this response reduces yields . \" You do n ' t want crop plants to stop growing , \" Howell said . \" You want them to continue to grow and produce even though they are under stress . \" With the new understanding of this stress response , the next step may be to silence the alarm system , said Howell . \" What may be important is to disable some of these stress responses . That may make the plant more productive under stress conditions . \"", "questions": "According to the text , an alarm in the plant cells is caused by", "options": {"model": ["the changed proteins", "the change of the environment", "the stress condition"], "human": ["the folded proteins", "the stress response genes", "the changed proteins"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
