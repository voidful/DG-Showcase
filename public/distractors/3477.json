In 1888 , at Hawara in the El Faiyum area of Egypt , two - thousand - year - old roses were found in ancient tombs . The discovery suggested roses were an important part of the complex burial ceremony which took place when an important person died . The roses found in the tombs are thought by modern experts to be the oldest preserved flowers ever found in the world . They must have been cut and dried before flowering so that they would remain undamaged . Over the centuries , the roses had shrunk and became tight balls , but on careful examination it was discovered that the petals themselves were hardly damaged . Egypt ' s skill in mass - cultivation of roses in early times led to the flowers becoming an important export product . At the height of the Roman Empire , Egypt exported large quantities of roses to the Roman courts . Wealthy Romans loved the beautiful color1s and sweet smells of roses . So the Romans attempted to grow their own roses and they eventually mastered the art of mass cultivation . Egypt then decided to concentrate on growing grain instead of roses , so grain soon took over as the number - one agricultural product of Egypt . Roses were appreciated in other early civilizations too , including Greece and Persia . They are a decorative feature on coins , sculpture , and vases dating back thousands of years . There is also evidence that roses were highly valued by the Chinese who believed that the flowers could be used to help treat a wide range of illnesses , from toothache to skin and chest diseases . In the modern world , the rose has not lost its popularity as the \" Queen of Flowers \" - - the name given to it by the Greek poetess Sappho . Even today more roses are sold than any other flower . Modern techniques have enabled people to create ever more beautiful roses . Transportation by air makes it possible to grow roses in countries with favorable climates and sell them within twenty - four hours in profitable markets all over the world .
