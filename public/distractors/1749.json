{"id": "1749", "article": "Magic is believed to have begun with the Egyptians , in 1700 BC . A magician named Dedi of Dedsnefu was reported to have performed for the pharaoh , or the king . He was also known to have entertained the slaves who built the pyramids . The \" Cups and Balls \" trick which he was particularly good at is still performed by magicians all over the world today . The ancient Greeks and Romans were also fascinated by the idea of magic . Actually , one of their main interests was the art of deception . This explains why at that time the priests even built magic devices into their temples . These devices made it possible for doors to open by themselves and wine to flow magically out of statues ' mouths . This was done mainly to convince people that the priests were powerful . Magic , however , was not well accepted before the 1800s . Magicians were thought of as freaks and were only allowed to perform in a circus . It was in the 19th century that the magician Robert Houdin came along and changed people ' s views and attitudes about magic . It was also because of Robert Houdin that many magicians were able to add Dr . or MD to their names . Today magicians try hard to find new ways to show their practiced skills . Magic is now entertainment for families all over the world .", "questions": "What would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the influence of magic", "the history of magic", "the power of magic"], "human": ["Magic as Entertainment", "A Great Magician", "The History of Magic"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
