{"id": "802", "article": "In the more and more competitive service industry , it is no longer enough to promise customer satisfaction . Today , customer \" delight \" is what companies are trying to achieve in order to keep and increase market share . It is accepted in the marketing industry , and confirmed by a number of researches , that customers receiving good service will promote business by telling up to 12 other people : those treated badly will tell their tales of woe to up to 20 people , 80 percent of people who feel their complaints are handled fairly will stay loyal New challenges for customer care have come when people can obtain goods and services through telephone call centers and the Internet . For example , many companies now have to invest a lot of money in information technology and staff training in order to cope with the \" _ \" - - caused by delays in answering calls , being cut off in mid - conversation or left waiting for long periods . \" Many people do not like talking to machines , \" says Dr . Storey Senior Lecturer in Marketing at City University Business School . \" Banks , for example , encourage staff at call centers to use customer data to establish instant and good relationship with them . The aim is to make the customer feel they know you and that you can trust - - the sort of comfortable feelings people have during face - to - face chats with their local branch manager . \" Recommended ways of creating customer delight include : under - promising and over - delivering ( saying that a repair will be carried out within five hours , but getting it done within two ) ; replacing a faulty product immediately : throwing in a gift voucher as an unexpected \" thank you \" to regular customers ; and always returning calls , even when they are complaints . Aiming for customer delight is all very well , but if services do not reach the high level promised , disappointment or worse will be the result . This can be eased by offering an apology and an explanation of why the service did not meet usual standards with _ ( for example , \" I know how you must feel \" ) , and possible solutions ( replacement , compensation or whatever fairness suggests best meets the case ) . Airlines face some of the toughest challenges over customer care . Fierce competition has convinced them that delighting passengers is an important marketing tool , while there is great potential for customer anger over delays caused by weather , unclaimed luggage and technical problems .", "questions": "Customer delight is important for airlines because", "options": {"model": ["the service is held through call centers and the internet", "they are more likely to meet with complaints", "they are more satisfied with their service"], "human": ["the services cost them a lot of money", "the policies can be applied to their staff", "they are more likely to meet with complaints"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
