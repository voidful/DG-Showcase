{"id": "2879", "article": "Too much eating . Too many unhealthy foods . Too many ads for food . Too few activities . Different reasons are given for America ' s weight problem - - - a problem increasingly shared by other countries . Almost one - fifth of American children and teenagers are overweight . Schools have been asked to increase physical education , an important tool for public health . However , a recent study has shown an increase in the number of injuries in P . E . classes . Researchers say one possible reason for this is a decrease in the number of school nurses . Schools without a nurse on duty may be more likely to send an injured child to a hospital . Another possible reason for more injuries is a change in the traditional idea of physical education . This \" New P . E . \" expands the kinds of sports that are taught . But activities that some schools offer now , like rock climbing and skateboarding , can also increase the risks , says Cheryl Richardson , who is with the National Association for Sport and Physical Education ( NASPE ) . She also says not all states require P . E . teachers to be specially trained . Untrained teachers could be less likely to recognize unsafe conditions . Cheryl Richardson points to one of the study ' s findings - that injuries are often the result of contact with a person or a structure . This tells her that the teachers were not giving each student enough space to move around safely . Six activities produced seventy percent of all injuries : running , basketball , football , volleyball , rugby and gymnastics . The researchers say larger class sizes are another possible reason for the increase in injuries . Larger classes can mean less supervision . The National Association for Sport and Physical Education says twenty to thirty students in a P . E . class should be the limit .", "questions": "Which of the following statements is TRUE ?", "options": {"model": ["the teachers were not giving each student enough space to move around safely .", "students are overweight because of lack of physical education .", "p . e . classes become more dangerous for students now in america .", "there are fewer students in p . e . classes in america than in other countries ."], "human": ["Fewer and fewer students are interested in P .
