{"id": "1209", "article": "Dear Lee , As I told you , I ' ll be gone until Wednesday morning . Thank you so much for taking on my \" children \" while I ' m away . Like real children , they can be kind of irritating sometimes , but I ' m going to enjoy myself so much more knowing they ' re getting some kind human attention .

She needs to go out several times a day , especially last thing at night and first thing in the morning . Let her stay out for about ten minutes each time , so she can do all her business .
