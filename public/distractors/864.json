{"id": "864", "article": "Convenience Foods Instead of buying only fresh foods , Americans nowadays buy many more convenience foods . These are foods which are ready partly or completely prepared . Many of them are frozen , such as frozen dinner , heat - and - serve French fries , and frozen pizzas . There are also many canned convenience foods , such as ready - made spaghetti , soups , stews and vegetables Convenience foods save time and trouble . They are popular with people who are busy or who do n ' t like to cook or wash dishes . But they often cost more than fresh , unprepared foods and many contain man - made additives . Also , many people feel they do n ' t taste as good as home - cooked foods . Health Food and Co - ops In the 1960s , a \" back - to - the - earth \" movement was started by young people in the United States . The movement was a reaction against the harmful effects of technology . From the movement came a new understanding of food and health . Many people now prefer natural and organic foods to the prepared foods sold in health foods stores and in food co - ops , which are small stores where customers help manage the store . In co - ops , food is usually not packaged . Customers bring their own bags and jars and scoop their food out of boxes or baskets . The Diet Craze These days Americans are more and more concerned with their weight . Perhaps as many as 70 million Americans are on weight - dollar business . American supermarkets sell a variety of diet food such as soft drinks , diet candy , and diet salad dressings . Dieters also spend money on diet pills , exercise machines , and jogging suits . Each year dozens of new diets are popularized . They have such names as the Miracle Diet , the Nine - day Wonder Diet , and the East 24 - hour Diet . There is even one called the Ice Cream Diet , which advises the dieters to eat only ice cream for lunch and dinner ! For dieters who can not lose weight on their own , there are many well - organized diet groups , which offer help and encouragement .", "questions": "What would be the best title for this text ?", "options": {"model": ["convenient food", "convenience foods", "a look at american food", "convenient foods"], "human": ["Eating American Food", "Making American Food", "Cooking American Food", "A Look at American Food"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
