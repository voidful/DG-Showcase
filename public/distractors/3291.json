{"id": "3291", "article": "The UK ' s \" hidden \" debt mountain stands at an estimated PS5bn , according to a new research today which reveals that as many as one in three consumers are keeping the full scale of their financial problems from their family . The research , for the Post Office , shows that while the average personal debt in the UK is PS9 , 731 . 51 , people only admit to owing half this when talking to a partner or member of their family . The new report exposes the serious emotional and physical consequences of covering up that debt , ranging from problems at work , sleepless nights and anxiety , to alcohol abuse . A recent report from the Commons public accounts committee said that in the UK , one person in 10 is struggling to manage their debts , while the total of all personal debt is some PS1 , 500bn . It warned that a government strategy to help consumers struggling with record levels of debt was \" seriously deficient \" because of poor management and a lack of leadership . The research was commissioned by the Post Office and carried out online by One Poll , which surveyed 2 , 258 UK consumers . Doug Strachan , director of financial services at the Post Office , said , \" The recession has put a massive strain on many families and people may be , for the first time , experiencing levels of debt that they can not control . The most important thing to remember is that if you do need to borrow money , make sure you are responsible about it and set out a clear repayment plan . Managing the debt effectively can mean there is no need to experience the terrible emotional and physical symptoms hiding debt can result in . \" Donna Dawson , psychologist specializing in personality , behavior and relationships , said the knock - on effects were enormous , \" hiding the extent of debt from a partner or family member may give us a false sense of control or independence , but the reality is that our mental and physical health suffers - - and once uncovered , the health of our loved ones suffers as well . The irony is that the very things we are trying to protect - - our trustworthiness and our good self - image - - are lost anyway , when all becomes revealed .", "questions": "According to Doug Strachan ' s words , we can see that", "options": {"model": ["the government should take measures to help consumers to solve the debts", "the government should take measures to protect the money", "poor management and a lack of leadership are the main causes of the problem", "people should make effective plans to pay the debts"], "human": ["people should not borrow money at any time", "the recession is the root for getting trouble in debts", "hiding debts from their families is harmful to themselves", "people should make effective plans to pay the debts"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
