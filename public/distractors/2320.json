Let me tell you about the people of Gotham so you can decide for yourself . Long ago , England was ruled by a cruel king named John . One day , the people of Gotham heard that King John and his men would soon be riding through their town . This worried the villagers , for they knew the greedy king would demand food and accommodation for his men . What ' s more , if he saw anything to his liking , he would surely take it . A town meeting was called . After much discussion , the townspeople decided to cut down a number of huge trees to block the roads leading into Gotham . When King John and his men reached the outskirts of the village , they could not pass . Angry , King John ordered his men to go into the town and punish the villagers .
