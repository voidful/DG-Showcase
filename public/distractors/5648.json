{"id": "5648", "article": "The word proactivity is fairly common in management literature , but you wo n ' t find it in the dictionary . It means that as a human being you take responsibility for your own life . Look at the word responsibility : ability to choose your response , response - ability . Effective people are proactive because they take responsibility . Their behavior is a product of their own decisions , based on values , rather than being a product of their own conditions , based on feelings . For instance , you are planning a picnic with your family . You ' re excited . You have all the preparations . You ' ve decided where to go , and then it becomes stormy , killing your plan . Proactive people . They realize what their purpose really was , and they creatively have a picnic elsewhere even if it ' s in their own basement with some special games , and make the best of that situation .

Being proactive is really just being true to your human nature . Your basic nature is to act , and not to be acted upon . That ' s true , despite widely accepted theories of determinism used to explain human nature . Determinism says that you do n ' t really choose anything and that what you call choices are nothing more than automatic responses to outside conditions .

They think things are determined by their environment , or by their conditions , or by their conditioning or their genetic makeup . Psychologically , people who believe they are determined will produce the evidence to support the belief , and they increasingly feel victimized and out of control . They ' re not in charge of their life at all . On the contrary , a proactive person exercises free will , the freedom to choose the response that best applies to his values . In that way , he gains control over the circumstances , rather than being controlled by", "questions": "When a picnic plan is threatened by a sudden storm , reactive people will probably", "options": {"model": ["take responsibility for the picnic", "put off their ideas and control", "complain and give up the picnic"], "human": ["have the picnic as planned", "make the best of the picnic", "complain and give up the picnic"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
