{"id": "3193", "article": "Please excuse me if I ' m a little quiet today . Mark is leaving , and I ' m kind of sad . You probably do n ' t know Mark , but you might know someone like him . He has been the heart and soul of the office for years . He has never been interested in getting praise for the wonderful work he does . He just does his job - very well . We ' re pleased that he is moving on to new , better things . But this does n ' t make it any easier to say goodbye . Life has a way of throwing curve balls at us . Just when we start to get comfortable with a person , a place or a situation , something comes along to change things . A nice neighbor moves away . Someone in the family graduates . A child finds new love through marriage . Our ability to deal with change and disruption decides to a great degree , our peace , happiness and satisfaction in life . But how do we do that ? Chris the California surfer , once told me that the answer to life ' s problems can be summed up in four words : \" Go with the flow . \" \" It ' s like surfing , \" Chris explained . \" You ca n ' t organize the ocean . Waves just happen . You ride them where they take you , then you paddle back out there and catch the next one . You ' re always hoping for the perfect wave where you can get it . But mostly you just take them the way they come . \" I think Chris was saying that life is a series of events - - both good and bad . There will always be things over which you have no control . The truly successful person expects the unexpected and is prepared to make adjustments . Do n ' t stop trying to make all your dreams come true . But when things come up that are n ' t exactly in your plan , work around them - - and then move on . We ' re going to miss Mark . But rather than dwell on the sadness of our parting , we ' ll focus on our hopes for a brighter future - - for him , and for us . We ' ll go out and do everything that we can to make that future happen .", "questions": "Why does the author quote Chris ' words ?", "options": {"model": ["because the author does n ' t agree with chris ' words .", "because chris ' words show the author ' s point .", "because chris ' s words are very important to the author ."], "human": ["Because Chris has experienced a lot in life .", "Because Chris ' words made people think .", "Because Chris ' words show the author ' s point ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
