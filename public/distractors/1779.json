{"id": "1779", "article": "\" Mobile phones killed our man , \" screamed one headline last year . Also came claims that an unpublished study had found that mobile phones cause memory loss . And a British newspaper devoted its front page to a picture supposedly showing how mobile phones heat the brain . For anyone who uses a moblie phone , these are worring times . But speak to the scientists whose work is the focus of these scared and you will hear a different story . What we do have , however , are some results suggesting that mobile phones ' emission have a variety of strange effects on living tissue that ca n ' t be explained by the general radiation biology . And it ' s only when the questions raised by these experients are answered that we ' ll be able to say for sure what moblie phones might be doing to the brain . One of the odd effects comes from the now famous \" merrory loss \" study . Alan Preece and his colleagues at the prefix = st1 / UniversityofBristolplaced a device that imitated the microwave emission of mobile phones to the left ear of volunteers . The volunteers were all goood at recalling words and pictures they had been shown on a computer screen . Preece says he still ca n ' t comment on the effects of using a mobile phone for years on end . But he rules out the suggestion that mobile phones have an immediate effect on our cognitive abilities . \" I ' m pretty sure there is no effect on short - term memory , \" he says . Another expert , Tatterasll , remarked that his latest findings have removed fears about memory loss . One result , for instance , suggests that nerve cell synapses exposed to microwaves become more - - - - rather than less - - - - - receptive to under - going changes linked to the memory formation . It would be an even happier outcome if microwave turned out to be good for you . It sounds crazy , but a couple of years ago a team led by William Adey at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in California , found that mice exposed to microwave for two hours a day were less likely to develop brain tumours when given a cancer - causing chemical . So should we forget about mobile phone radiation causing brain tumours and scrambling our minds ? \" If it does n ' t certainly cause cancer in animals and cells , then it probably is n '", "questions": "What worries people who use mobile phones ?", "options": {"model": ["mobile phones cause memory loss", "all above is right", "mobile phones can heat the brain", "they do n ' t have to develop brain t cells"], "human": ["Mobile phones will kill them", "Mobile phones cause memory loss", "Mobile phones heat the brain", "All above is right"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
