{"id": "3344", "article": "Have you ever heard a news reporter talk about DNA ? Reporters talk about DNA found at the scene of a crime . They talk about police finding DNA \" fingerprints \" . Police sometimes use DNA as a clue to find out who committed the crime . DNA is a substance that makes up genes . Everything alive has genes . Plants have genes . Animals have genes . You have genes . Genes are the basic units of heredity . Heredity means all the characteristics you inherit from your parents . You get your genes from your parents . You inherit half of your genes from your mother . You inherit half of your genes from your father . Genes are a kind of code . A tree ' s genes tell what shape its leaves will be . A cat ' s genes tell what color its fur will be . Your genes tell what color your eyes will be . Your genes tell what color your hair will be . Everything about you comes from the code in your genes . Genes line up on strands called chromosomes in cells . Everything alive is made up of cells . Chromosomes are in the center , or nucleus of cells . Different parts of you are made of different kinds of cells . Your muscles are made of muscle cells . Your skin is made of skin cells . The code in your genes tells your body to make different kinds of cells . The genes in each cell tell the cell how to work . They tell the cell when to make new copies of itself . An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first saw inherited patterns in pea plants . He experimented with pea plants in the 1860s . One of the things , or traits Mendel studied was what makes some pea plants tall and some short . He said that the traits must come from units of heredity passed from the parent plants . These units were later called genes . In the mid - 1900s , scientists discovered that genes are made of DNA . In the 1970s , scientists learned how to change DNA with genetic engineering . Scientists also learned that problems with certain genes cause diseases . Muscular dystrophy , cystic fibrosis , and hemophilia are some genetic diseases - - diseases caused by problems in genes . Today , scientists are looking for ways to cure genetic diseases by changing genes through a process called gene therapy .", "questions": "An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel", "options": {"model": ["discovered the genes in each cell", "was the first person who found gene", "was the first who discovered genes", "found the reason why scientists discovered gene"], "human": ["first saw inherited patterns in people", "was interested in why plants were different", "first called the units of heredity from parents genes", "was the first who discovered genes"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
