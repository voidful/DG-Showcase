One out of every six Americans work at putting together the parts of cars , driving trucks , building roads or filling cars with gas . Most Americans find it hard to think what life would be without a car . However , some have realized the serious problem of air pollution by cars . The polluted air is poisonous and dangerous to health . One way to get rid of the polluted air is to design a new car that does not pollute . That ' s what several large car factories are trying to do . But to build the new car is easier said than done . Progress in this field has been slow . Another way is to take place of the car engine by something else . Engineers are now working on some new cars . Many makers believe that it will take years to develop a practical model that pleases man . To prevent the world from being polluted by cars , we ' ll have to make some changes in the way many of us live . Americans , for example , have to cut down the number of their cars they are encouraged to travel and go to work by bike . Riding a bike is thought to help keep the air clean . But this change does not come easily , a large number of workers may find themselves with no jobs if a car factory closes down . And the problem of air pollution would become less important than that of unemployment .", "questions": "If the number of cars is cut down , the most serious problem in American workers is", "options": {"model": ["to make some changes in the way many of us live", "to make a new car which does not pollute", "to have no work to do"], "human": ["to keep the air clean", "to go to work by bike", "to have no work to do"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
