{"id": "5265", "article": "Scientists are developing a new kind of machine to take the place of humans . These machines can do jobs in places that are too dangerous for humans . For example , they are being developed to work in nuclear power center , deep under the oceans and in outer space . John Marrit , a psychologist in Williamsburg Massachusetts , helped develop the new machine . This is how they work . A machine is placed in an area far away from the person who operates it . The person wears special hard hat with television screens and sound equipment . The screens and sound equipment let the person see and hear exactly what the machine is seeing and hearing . Mr . Marrit says this gives the person the feeling of being in the same place as the machine . The idea , he says , is being there without going there . The person uses an electronic control to make the machine move . The machine copies the person ' s movements exactly . If the person raises his right arm , the machine raises the right arm , too . This means an expert can do a dangerous job while staying in the safe place . For example , a person can direct the machine to destroy a bomb without going near the bomb himself .", "questions": "The difference between such a new machine and a robot is that", "options": {"model": ["the machine can do everything like a human", "the new machine is more difficult to make than a robot", "the new machine can work in nuclear power center"], "human": ["the new machine is more difficult to be controlled", "a robot ca n ' t be used in places too dangerous or faraway", "the new machine is more difficult to make than a robot"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
