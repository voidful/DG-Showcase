{"id": "4844", "article": "The English Fashion recently asked people about their wonderful ideas and plans about things they could do . The magazine asked people the following question , \" If you had all the money you wanted , what would you like to do ? \" About 500 people answered the survey question . Almost half ( 49 % ) of the people in the survey said they would buy material things such as a bigger house or a better car . One fifth ( 20 % ) of the people said they would travel to the interesting or famous places . 17 % answered that they would give money to someone else . They would donate money to a charity or to help poor people . More than half of the rest of the people ( about 10 % ) said they would give money to help medical research . All the other people in the English Fashion survey said they would save money in the bank . They said they did n ' t know what they would like to do right now , but perhaps in a few years they would find a good use for the money . \" Lots of people think that if they buy bigger and better things , they will feel happier , \" said Dr Mary Wilson . \" However , \" she said , \" _ will not last long . After a while , they wo n ' t be happy with them any longer . \" Dr Wilson thinks the happiest people are those who make a change in people ' s lives . She thinks those people who give money to someone else or to medical research are thinking more of others at the moment . If they had all the money theywanted , they would change the world .", "questions": "Who did Dr Wilson think were the unhappiest people ?", "options": {"model": ["the people who would give money to others .", "the people who could do what they did right in their lives .", "the people who would spend the money on material things .", "the people who could make a change in people ' s lives ."], "human": ["The people who would give the money to a charity .", "The people who would save the money for the future .", "The people who would give the money to medical research .", "The people who would spend the money on material things ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
