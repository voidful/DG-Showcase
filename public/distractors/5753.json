Scientists from American University looked at the eating behavior of 54 kids between the ages of 2 and 6 . At snack time , the scientist watched the amount of food each child ate while they were in groups of either three or nine . According to the study , the more children there are in a group , the more likely they are to eat more . Those in the larger group ate nearly 30 percent more than those in the smaller group , and they actually ate faster . Since this is the first such study in children , scientists are quick to point out the importance of encouraging healthy habits in kids as early as possible . \" If you know kids eat more in large groups , it seems perfect to use this information to keep snack groups small or use small tables , \" says Dr . Jana Klauer , an expert in New York . Smaller groups would allow for a quiet and more relaxing environment - a perfect chance to teach children about food , manners and how to know when they feel full . \" This would have an effect on kids ' eating , \" adds Klauer . \" They would slow down and eat less . \"", "questions": "The best title of the passage", "options": {"model": ["new study about eating", "researchers in new york", "snack time", "a study in children"], "human": ["Different Groups", "Eating More", "Food for Kids", "Snack Time"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
