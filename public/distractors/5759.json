{"id": "5759", "article": "Is it important to have breakfast every day ? A short time ago , a test was given in the United States . People of different ages , from 12 to 83 , were asked to have a test . During the test , these people were given all kinds of breakfast , and sometimes they got no breakfast at all . Scientists wanted to see how well their bodies worked after eating different kinds of breakfast . The results show that if a person eats a right breakfast , he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast . If a student has fruit , eggs , bread and milk before going to school , he or she will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class . Some people think it will help you lose weight if you have no breakfast . But the result is opposite to what they think . This is because people become so hungry at noon that they eat too much for lunch . They will gain weight instead of losing it .", "questions": "What were the people given during the test ?", "options": {"model": ["different foods or sometimes none .", "all kinds of food .", "all kinds of breakfast in the day .", "all kinds of breakfast ."], "human": ["No breakfast at all .", "Very rich breakfast .", "Little food for breakfast .", "Different foods or sometimes none ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
