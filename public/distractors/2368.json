{"id": "2368", "article": "\" Soon , you ' re going to have to move out ! \" cried my neighbor upon seeing the largest tomato plant known to mankind , or at least known in my neighborhood . One tiny 9 - inch plant , bought for $ 1 . 25 in the spring . has already taken over much of my rose bed , covering much of other plants , and is well on its way to the front door . Roses require a good deal of care , and if it were n ' t for the pleasure they give . it would n ' t be worth the work . As it is . I have a garden full of sweet - smelling roses for most of the year . Bushes must be pruned in early spring , leaving ugly woody branches until the new growth appears a few weeks later . It was the space available in the garden that led me into planting just one little tomato plant . A big mistake . Soil conditions made just perfect for roses turn out be even more perfect for tomatoes . The daily watering coupled with full sun and regular fertilizing have turned the little plant into a tall bush . The cage I placed around it as the plant grew has long since disappeared under the thick leaves . Now the task I face in harvesting the fruit is twofold . First . I have to find the red ones among the leaves , which means I almost have to stand on my head . and once found I have to reach down and under , pick the tomatoes and withdraw my full fist without dropping the prize so dearly won . I found two full - blown white roses completely hidden as I picked tomatoes in June . But they were weak and the leaves already yellow for lack of light . Here I am faced with a painful small decision : To tear up a wonderful and productive tomato plant that offers up between ten and twenty ripe sweet tomatoes each day or say goodbye to several expensive and treasured roses . Like Scarlett in Gone With the Wind . I ' ll think about that tomorrow .", "questions": "This year the writer ' s roses were", "options": {"model": ["removed from the tomato plant", "1argey planted in the garden", "1argely hidden under the tomato plant"], "human": ["removed from the rose bed", "picked along with the tomatoes", "1argely hidden under the tomato plant"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
