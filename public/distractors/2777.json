The scientists say that young people need up to three hours a day of outdoor light , but many infants are also missing out as they nap during lunch time . Dr .

They point to Singapore as a place with several different racial groups , all of whom are now suffering high levels of short - sightedness . The authors suggest that compulsory time outdoors should be considered by educational authorities across South - East Asia as a way of dealing with the problem .", "questions": "What does the passage mainly talk about ?", "options": {"model": ["the causes of south - east asia .", "ways to deal with the problem in south - east asia .", "sight problems in south - east asia ."], "human": ["Educational achievement in Asia .", "Massive educational pressures", "Sight problems in South - East Asia ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
