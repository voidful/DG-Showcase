He wanted to borrow a lot of money to learn to paint pictures , but he did not think he could pay off the debts .

He did n ' t know where the money came from and how to spend it . He said to himself , \" I could go to find a hotel and live like a rich man for a few days ; or I give up my work in the factory and do what I ' d like to do : painting pictures I could do that for a few weeks , but what would I do after that ? I should have lost my place of the factory and have no money to live on . If it were a little less money , I would buy a new coat , or a radio , or give a dinner to my friends . If it were more , I could give up the work and pay for painting pictures . But it ' s too much for one and too little for the other . \" \" Here is the reading of your uncle ' s will , \" said the lawyer , \" telling what is to be done with this money after his death . I must ask you to remember one point . Your uncle has said you must bring me a paper showing exactly what you did with his money , as soon as you have spent it . \" \" Yes , I see . I ' ll do that . \" said the young man .", "questions": "Hobbs was dumbfounded on receiving the money because he thought", "options": {"model": ["the money did n ' t mean anything", "the money was too much"], "human": ["the money was too little", "the money was too much"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
