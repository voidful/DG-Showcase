We may see the same scene everywhere in our life : in subway stations , restaurants , elevators and so on , people are watching their cell phones . From a family reunion to a date with a friend , people could n ' t stop checking their twitter and facebook on the cell phones and ignoring the persons in front completely , Phubbing not only involves young people , but also the elderly and kids . \" Phubbing \" is a new term which comes from the words \" phone ' ' and \" snub \" . It describes the habit of snubbing someone in favor of a cell phone . The word \" phubbing \" was included in the Australian National Dictionary in 2012 .
