With a little effort , and not much money , most of us could reduce our energy diets by 25 percent or more - - doing the Earth a favor while also helping our wallets . Not long ago , my wife , PJ , and I tried a new diet - - not to lose a little weight but to answer an annoying question about climate change . Scientists have reported recently that the world is heating up even faster than predicted only a few years ago , and that the consequences could be severe if we do n ' t keep reducing emission of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and other greenhouse gases that are trapping heat in our atmosphere . We decided to try an experiment . For one month we recorded our personal emission of CO2 . We wanted to see how much we could cut back , so we went on a strict diet . The average US household produces about 150 pounds of CO2a day by doing common things like turning on air conditioning or driving cars . That ' s more than twice the European average and almost five times the global average , mostly because Americans drive more and have bigger houses . But how much should we try to reduce ? For an answer , I checked with Tim Flannery , author of The Weather Makers : How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth . In his book , he had challenged readers to make deep cuts in personal emission to keep the world from reaching extremely important _ , such as the melting of the ice sheets in Greenland or West Antarctica . \" To stay below that point , we need to reduce CO2emission by 80 percent , \" he said . Good advice , I thought . I ' d opened our bedroom windows to let in the wind . We ' d gotten so used to keeping our air - conditioning going around the clock . I ' d almost forgotten the windows even opened . We should not let this happen again . It ' s time for us to change our habits if necessary .", "questions": "According to the passage , Tim Flannery", "options": {"model": ["was a member of a magazine about how to change our habits", "was a member of a magazine about climate change", "wrote a book about the climate changes"], "human": ["made deep cuts in his personal emission of CO 2", "succeeded in reducing CO 2emission by 80 percent", "wrote a book about the climate changes"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
