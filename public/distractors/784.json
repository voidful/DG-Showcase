Mumbai used to be known as Bombay , and so the film industry there is called \" Bollywood \" . Each year , Bollywood makes twice as many movies as Hollywood . The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies . For one thing , Bollywood movies are longer than most Hollywood movies . Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long , and contain singing , dancing , adventure , mystery and romance . Because Bollywood films has so many different characters , this style of film is called a \" masala \" film . Masala is an Indian word for a mixture of spices . Another big difference is the way the movies are made . It takes longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood . In fact , filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished . The director and writers can make up the story while the filming is being made . Sometimes they even write the script by hand instead of typing it . Bollywood actors are so popular that some of them may even work on several movies at the same time . They may even make several different films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery . Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story , shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors . This also helps to keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies .", "questions": "Bollywood movies are cheap to make because", "options": {"model": ["they are shorter than hollywood films .", "hollywood is much longer than hollywood films .", "some movie reuses things from other movies ."], "human": ["they are shorter than Hollywood films .", "the movies do not use any special effects .", "some movie reuses things from other movies ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
