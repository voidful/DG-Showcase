Westez , more commonly known as Red Thunder Cloud , was the last speaker of the Native American language , Catawba . www . ks5u . com Anyone who wants to hear various songs of the Catawba tribe can get in touch with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D . C . , where , back in the 1940s , Red Thunder Cloud recorded a series of songs for future generations . They are all that is left of the Catawba language . The language that people used to speak is gone forever . We are all aware of the damage that modern industry can do to the world ' s ecology . However , few people are aware of the effect that widely spoken languages have on other languages and ways of life . English has spread all over the world . Chinese , Spanish , Russian , and Hindi have become powerful languages , as well . As these languages become more powerful , their use as tools of business and culture increases . When this happens , hundreds of languages that are spoken by only a few people die out . Scholars believe there are about 6 , 000 languages around the world , but more than half of them could die out within the next 100 years . Araki is a native language of the island of Vanuatu , located in the Pacific Ocean . It is spoken by only a few older adults , so like Catawba , Araki will soon disappear . Many languages of Ethiopia will have the same fate because each one has only a few speakers . In the Americas , 100 languages also are dying out . Red Thunder Cloud was one of the first to recognize the threat of language death and to try to do something about it . He was not actually born into the Catawba tribe , and the language was not his mother tongue . However , he was a frequent visitor to the Catawba reservation in South Carolina , where he learned the language . The songs he sang for the Smithsonian Institution helped to make Native American music popular . Now he is gone , and the language is dead .", "questions": "What do we learn about Red Thunder Cloud ?", "options": {"model": ["he was born into the catawba tribe .", "he used to visit the catawba reservation often .", "it was the first speaker of the native american language ."], "human": ["He was born into the Catawba tribe .", "He learned Catawba from his mother .", "He used to visit the Catawba reservation often ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
