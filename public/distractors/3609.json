A group of artists founded a commune in southern Colorado called \" Drop City \" . Following the ideas of philosopher and architect Buckminster Fuller , they built dome - shaped houses from pieces of old cars . Other groups , such as author Ken Kesey ' s Merry Pranksters , the followers of San Francisco poet Steve Gaskin , and a group that called itself the Hog Farm , lived in old school houses and traveled around the United States . The Hog Farm become famous when they helped organize the Woodstock Rock Festival in 1969 . The followers of Steve Gaskin tried to settle down on a farm in Tennessee , but they had to leave when some members of the group were arrested for growing marijuana .

Skinner . The people who lived at Twin Oaks were carefully controlled by Skinner ' s conditioning techniques to do things that were good for the community .
