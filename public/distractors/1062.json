{"id": "1062", "article": "In English everything is the other way round . On Sundays , on the Continent even the poorest person puts on his best suit , tries to look respectable , and at the same time the life of the country becomes gay and cheerful ; in England even the richest lord or motor - manufacturer dresses in some peculiar rags , does not shave , and the country becomes dull and sad . On the Continent there is one subject which should be avoided - - - the weather ; in England , if you do not repeat the sentence \" Lovely day , is n ' t it ? \" at least two hundred times a day , you are considered a bit dull . On the Continent people use a fork as though a fork were a shovel ; in England they turn it upside down and push everything - - - including peas - - - on top it . On a Continental bus approaching a request stop , the conductor rings the bell if he wants his bus to go on without stopping ; in England you ring the bell if you want the bus to stop ; On the Continent people have good food ; in England people have good table . On the continent almost every nation whether little or great has openly declared at one time or another that it is superior to all other nations ; the English fight heroic wars to combat these dangerous ideas without ever mentioning which is really the most superior race in the world . Continental people are sensitive and touchy ; The English take everything with a sense of humor - - - they are only offended if you tell them that they have no sense of humor . On the Continent the population consists of a small percentage of criminals , a small percentage of honest people and the rest are a vague transition between the two ; in England you find a small percentage of criminals and the rest are honest people . On the other hand , people on the Continent either tell you the truth or lie ; in England they hardly ever lie , but they would not dream of telling you the truth . Many continentals think life is a game ; the English think cricket is a game .", "questions": "Which of the following can be the best title of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["an interesting comparison - - - the english and the continentals .", "the english and the conditions -"], "human": ["The Round and The Flat People - - - The English and The Continentals .", "An Interesting Comparison - - - The English and The Continentals ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
