{"id": "3783", "article": "Yves Gomes is now a university student in Maryland , but he may soon have to leave the country . \" I still want to continue with my college education and I want to be able to study here and go to medical school , \" he said . Gomes is one of thousands of young illegal immigrants who grew up in the United States and are now studying at American colleges and universities . He is doing well in his studies , but he is fighting deportation to India , a country he left with his parents when he was just 14 months old . They were deported more than a year ago . \" If I was to go back to India I would just feel like all of that would have gone to waste because here at least I am still able to go to college , \" he said . Immigration is a divisive political issue in the United States with some 11 million people in the country illegally . One element of the debate is the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16 . Pending legislation know as the DREAMAct would give them a chance to become legal residents if they complete two years of college or join the military . Milanie Schwartz , a politically conservative student at the University of Texas , explains why some Americans oppose the legislation . \" We think it ' s unfair that students who are illegal immigrants would get a fast track to citizenship , while people who did come here legally would n ' t have those same opportunities , \" she said . \" The question is legalization or not , \" said Jon Feere , who also opposes the DREAM Act . He is a policy analyst with the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington and is concerned about the act ' s effect on the economy . \" There ' s a lot of unemployment in the United States right now . And there are already many legal immigrants who are already here who are desperate for those jobs , \" he said . But supporters of the DREAMAct say well - educated immigrants would help the economy . Raul Hinojosa is an immigration research analyst at UCLA . \" Not letting them contribute to the economy would not only lose all the financial investment we have already made in", "questions": "Which of the following descriptions about Yves Gomes is true ?", "options": {"model": ["he was born in india before his parents immigrated to america illegally .", "he is now studying at american colleges and universities .", "he is now studying at american colleges and universities in the us .", "he is a college student in california ."], "human": ["His parents were forced to leave India more than a year ago .", "He wants to finish school in America and become a nurse in India after graduation .", "He is optimistic about the passage of the DREAMAct .", "He was born in India before his parents immigrated to America illegally ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
