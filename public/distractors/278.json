{"id": "278", "article": "Right in the heart of America - - in Smith Center , Kansas , to be exact - - high school football coach Roger Barta glanced at his notes as he stood among the sea of players gathered before him . It was 6 : 30 a . m . on August 18 , 2008 , the first day of practice for this edition of the Redmen and the 31st opening day of the season for Barta , longtime coach and former math teacher at Smith Center High School . Barta wore a red T - shirt covering a ball - shaped belly . Barta began with basic instructions : Drink lots of water . Fine advice . But what Coach Barta laid out next was the essential game plan - - life lessons that many people consider his greatest strength . \" Someone here is the best , and someone is the worst , \" he said . \" It ' s time to forget about that . Let ' s respect each other . Thus , we ' ll like each other and then love each other . That ' s when , together , we ' ll become champions . \" He paused for a moment . When he continued , he spoke with even more fervor to the 56 young men sitting before him . \" One more thing , guys . We do n ' t talk about winning and losing . We talk about getting a little better every day , about being the best we can be , about being a team . And when we do that , winning and losing take care of themselves . \" Over the next four months , the Redman went on to beat each competitor , winning another perfect season . As their coach , Barta has created a 289 - 58 record , eight Kansas state championships , and 67 victories . In high school football , it ' s the longest win in the nation . Through it all , Coach Barta kept his word : Not once did he ever say that a game was do - or - die . \" None of this is really about football , \" he had explained to me back in 2007 , convincingly enough to force me to move to Smith Center from New York City with my wife , Mary , and three - year - old son , Jack , so I could write about him for a year . \" What I hope we ' re doing is sending kids into life who know that every day means something . \"", "questions": "According to the passage , we learn that Barta", "options": {"model": ["was once a teacher", "is a football coach", "won another perfect season in the game"], "human": ["is a basketball coach", "has been a coach for 40 years", "was once a teacher"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
