{"id": "766", "article": "One of the most widely accepted , commonly repeated assumptions in our culture is that if you exercise , you will lose weight . I exercise all the time , but I still have gut fat that hangs over my belt when I sit . Why is n ' t all the exercise getting rid of it ? It ' s a question many of us could ask . More than 45 million Americans now belong to a health club , up from 23 million in 1993 . We spend some $ 19 billion a year on gym memberships . Of course , some people join and never go . Still , as one major study - - the Minnesota Heart Survey - - found , more of us at least say we exercise regularly . And yet obesity figures have risen sharply in the same period : a third of Americans are obese , and another third count as overweight by the Federal Government ' s definition . Yes , it ' s entirely possible that those of us who regularly go to the gym would weigh even more if we exercised less .

They less often develop cancer and many other illnesses . But the past few years of obesity research show that the role of exercise in weight loss has been wildly over - evaluated . \" In general , for weight loss , exercise is pretty useless , \" says Eric Ravussin , exercise researcher at Louisiana State University . Many recent studies have found that exercise is n ' t as important in helping people lose weight as you hear so regularly in gym advertisements or on shows likeThe Biggest Loser - - or , for that matter , from magazines like this one .
