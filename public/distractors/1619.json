{"id": "1619", "article": "Thousands of teenagers will be able to transfer to a new wave of \" studio schools \" at the age of 14 to improve their chances of finding a job in UK . A dozen new - style schools are designed to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs - - young people not in education , employment or training . Under plans , schools will operate longer days and work outside standard academic terms . Each pupil will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with businesses linked to the school and teenagers will be assigned a personal coach to act as an academic \" line manager \" . The reforms are put forward due to the fears that too many teenagers are now finishing full - time education lacking the skills needed to succeed in the workplace . According to a recent report , more than two - thirds of employers believe school and college leavers lack important \" employability skills \" such as customer awareness , while 55 per cent say they are unable to manage their time or daily tasks . And the number of NEETs has hit a record high , with almost one - in - five young people being left without a job or training place . The Department for Education will announce the establishment of 12 studio schools - - meeting the need of around 3 , 600 teenagers - - in areas such as Liverpool , Stevenage , Stoke - on - Trent and Fulham , west London . Each one , opening in 2012 , will be linked to a series of local employers . Under plans , pupils will be able to transfer out of ordinary schools to attend them between the age of 14 and 19 . The Government said all subjects would be taught \" through projects , often designed with employers \" - - with disciplines such as science being linked directly to local engineering firms or hospitals . Schools will operate a longer day to give pupils a better understanding of the demands of the workplace . Along with their studies , pupils will carry out work placements for four hours a week , rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19 . They will also get the chance to take professional qualifications linked directly to the needs of local employers .", "questions": "According to the passage , the NEETs are referred to those who", "options": {"model": ["are able to manage their time or daily tasks without education", "have no jobs without accepting education and work training", "have no jobs or training"], "human": ["often miss classes from school", "refuse to take any kind of part - time jobs after school", "have no jobs without accepting education and work training"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
