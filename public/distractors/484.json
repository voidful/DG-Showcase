{"id": "484", "article": "Grandparents are important people in everyone ' s life . They are those people who take care of you and love you . They are special persons who can give you wise advice . My grandparents always teach me to respect others , and they show me that love and feelings are important things in life and that we should n ' t pay much attention to material things or what people look like . My grandparents show a mixture of cultures and nationalities because they come from different countries . For example , my grandfather on my mother ' s side is from Spain , and my grandmother is also from Spain , but from a different city . On my father ' s side , my grandfather is from Venezuela , and my grandmother is from Italy . A1though they are from different countries , my grandparents have a very good relationship . What ' s more , my grandparents are people that always keep in touch with the new things in the world . For example , my grandmothers always care about fashion , how they dress and their personal appearance . And my grandfathers always care about the important events in the world . I think I am very lucky that all of my grandparents are alive because I have learned so much from them , I would like to continue learning from them even though we are living in different countries now . I will always remember my grandparents as role models for me .", "questions": "In the writer ' s opinion , how should we treat our grandparents ?", "options": {"model": ["we should respect them and learn from them .", "we should n ' t pay attention to the things they do n ' t like ."], "human": ["We should live together with our grandparents .", "We should respect them and learn from them ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
