{"id": "1503", "article": "A heartbroken dog whose owner died two months ago is missing her so much that he attends services every day at the Italian church where her funeral was held , patiently waiting for her to return . Tommy , a seven - year - old dog , belonged to Maria Lochi , 57 , and had been her faithful partner after she adopted him when she found him in fields close to her home . Mrs . Lochi adopted several dogs she found but friends said she developed a close friendship with Tommy and would walk to church with him every day , where he would be allowed to sit patiently by her feet . Father Panna said , \" He ' s there every time I celebrate Mass and is very well behaved . He does n ' t make a sound , and I ' ve not heard one bark from him in all the time he has been in . He used to come with Maria and he was obviously devoted to her . I let him stay inside as he was always so well behaved and none of the other people ever complained to me . He ' s still coming to Mass even after Maria ' s funeral , he just sat there quietly . I did n ' t have the heart to throw him out . I ' ve just recently lost my own dog so I leave him there until Mass finishes and then I let him out . \" Tommy ' s been adopted by everyone in the village now and he is everybody ' s friend . Everyone looks out for him and leaves food for him , although it would be nice to find a proper home for him . The story of Tommy is similar to the 2009 Hollywood filmHachiwhich told of how a faithful Akita dog waits patiently for his master after he also dies . It was based on the true story of a Japanese Akita called Hachi , whose owner died in 1925 but for the next nine years he waited patiently at the railway station for his owner from where they regularly caught a train .", "questions": "What does the writer want to tell us by quoting what Father Panna said ?", "options": {"model": ["why the dog can stay in the church every day .", "the story of the dog was based on the story .", "the story of the dog ."], "human": ["How the dog came to Mass with Maria .", "Where Father Panna allows the dog to stay .", "Why the dog can stay in the church every day ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
