{"id": "4914", "article": "Sometimes I really doubt whether there is love between my parents . Every day they are busy earning money . They do n ' t act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV . My father has a bad temper . When he ' s tired from the hard work , it is easy for him to lose his temper . One day , my mother was sewing a quilt . \" Mom , may I ask you a question ? \" I said . \" What ? \" \" Is there love between you and Dad ? \" I asked her in a very low voice . My mother stopped her work and raised her head in surprise . She did n ' t answer immediately . Then she continued to sew the quilt . I was very worried because I thought I had hurt her . But at last I heard my mother say the following words : \" Susan , look at the thread . Sometimes it appears , but most of it disappears in the quilt . It makes the quilt strong . If life is a quilt , then love should be a thread . It can hardly be seen , but it ' s really there . Love is inside . \" I could n ' t understand her until the next spring . My dad got sick suddenly . My mum had to stay with him in the hospital for a month . When they returned , they both looked very pale . _ . After they were back , every day in the morning and dusk , my mother helped my father walk slowly on the country road . The doctor had said my father would recover in two months . But after two months he still could n ' t walk by himself . All of us were worried about him . \" Dad , how are you feeling now ? \" I asked . \" Susan , do n ' t worry about me , \" he said gently . \" I just like walking with your mom . I like this kind of life . \" Looking at his eyes , I knew he loves my mother deeply . Once I thought love meant flowers , gifts and sweet kisses . But now , I understand that love is just like the thread . Love is inside , making life strong and warm .", "questions": "The writer felt worried because", "options": {"model": ["she could n ' t find her mother ' s love", "she thought she hurt her mum ' s heart", "she did n ' t think her mother was too serious"], "human": ["her mum did n ' t know how to answer the question", "her mum ' s answer was hard to understand", "she thought she hurt her mum ' s heart"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
