The girl and her \" One Piece of Paper Team \" are planting trees to improve the environment . They collect waste paper to sell for trees and have set up websites to spread the message of connections between humans and nature . \" We want to make environmental protection everyone ' s habit , \" says the girl . \" Even a piece of paper matters . \" Eager to join Zhou in such meaningful work ? Now you are offered advice on what to do . Last month , measures for public participation in environmental protection were published by the State Environmental protection Administration . The special measures are expected to change the light rain of the past into a storm of environmental protection . Last year ' s Songhua River pollution acted as an alarm to Chinese people . According to SEPA officials , environmental pollution has become serious , and will continue so for the next 15 years . A recent survey showed that though most Chinese people care about environmental problems , they do n ' t put their concerns into practice . One reason is that they do n ' t know how . So the newly published measures present information about how to report environmental problems and how to join in the battle against pollution . Actually there is much you can do in daily life . Buy less to reduce waste . Do n ' t throw away things before you have made the most use of them . Use electricity , water and gas only when necessary . Switch them off when you do n ' t need them . Everyone can participate in making the planet suitable for future generations .
