{"id": "3810", "article": "Tuvalu is located in the South Pacific . It is tiny and has only nine islands with a population of just 11 , 000 . In 1999 , it was the third - poorest country in the world . The islanders earned just $ 1 , 000 each year . But then something unusual happened . Tuvalu received an internet domain name - - the letters \" tv \" . These letters were very interesting for many companies around the world . A communication company from California offered to buy the domain name \" tv \" for $ 40 m . For the Tuvalans this was a very large amount of money . The islanders became very rich . Because of global warming , and because the islands are only 3 m above sea level , Tuvalu will probably become the first country in the world that will disappear under the sea . You can already see signs of the rising sea on Tuvalu . Some beaches are disappearing and you can see tree roots by the ocean . Cyclones used to be very rare but they now appear a few times a year , and the rains that come with the cyclones cause flooding . Despite these problems , the Tuvalans had their new money . They could use it to buy themselves a future . Or at least they could use it to buy some time . Paul Lindsay , a documentary film - maker , took these questions with him all the way to Tuvalu , and came back with an incredible story . As the water rises , the Tuvalans are using the money to develop the land . They are building new houses , planning nightclubs , restaurants and hotels and new cars are driving around on new roads . The residents do not think this is strange : \" Just because we are sinking , it does n ' t mean we do n ' t want to raise our standards of living . \" Sam Teo , Tuvalu ' s minister for natural resources told Lindsay .", "questions": "Why did Paul Lindsay come to Tuvalu ?", "options": {"model": ["to know how the tuvalans live and earns money .", "to see how the tuvalans live .", "to know how the tuvalans survive despite all of their problems ."], "human": ["To make a documentary film to record the life of the Tuvalans .", "To discover the reason for the Tuvalans not to improve their living standards .", "To know how the Tuvalans survive despite all of their problems ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
