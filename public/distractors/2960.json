{"id": "2960", "article": "No one knows how man learned to make words . Perhaps he began by making sounds like those made by animals . Perhaps he grunted like a pig when he lifted something heavy . Perhaps he made sounds like those he heard all round him - - water splashing , bees humming , a stone falling to the ground . Somehow he learned to make words . As the centuries went by , he made more and more new words . This is what we mean by language . People living in different countries made different kinds of words . Today there are about fifteen hundred different languages in the world . Each contains four or five hundred thousand words . But we do not need all these . Only a few thousand words are used in everyday life . The words you know are called your vocabulary . You should try to make your vocabulary larger . Read as many books as you can . There are plenty of books written in easy language . Your dictionary is your most useful book .", "questions": "What do we mean by language ?", "options": {"model": ["different kinds of words .", "different kinds of sound ."], "human": ["All the words made by man .", "Different kinds of sound ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
