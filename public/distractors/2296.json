{"id": "2296", "article": "Have you ever looked toward the sky on a fall day and witnessed a group of migrating birds ? If so , you probably noted the V - shaped formation of the birds or the birds flying in a ball - like formation . Why do birds fly this way ? Many theories have been developed to explain the formation patterns of different types of birds . One theory is that birds fly in certain formations to take advantage of the laws of nature . The birds know that flying in a V - shaped pattern will save energy . Like the lead cyclist in a race who decreases wind force for the cyclists who follow , the lead bird cuts wind force for the birds that follow . This decrease in wind force means that the birds use up to 70 percent less energy during their flight . When the lead bird becomes tired , a more rested bird takes over that position . But saving energy is important for more than one reason . Sometimes food is short during migration flights . Keeping energy enables the birds to fly longer distances between meals . When food is sighted , the birds guide one another in a different way . When a bird identifies a familiar feeding area , it might turn around in order to signal the group to change direction . Then , this bird becomes the new leader . It helps guarantee that other birds will know exactly where it is going . Then the whole group makes a change in direction , gently streaming from the sky down to the ground . This formation is like an arrow pointing to the location of food . Scientists have also studied the birds that sometimes fly in a ball - like formation . Researchers believe that the birds come together if a predator is spotted . The predator may then become impatient waiting for a single bird to fly away from the group . The birds will often dip and dive as a group , frustrating even the most persistent enemy . Scientists report that this is a very effective method of defense against an attack . The birds care for their fellow fliers through teamwork . As transportation expert Henry Ford once said , \" If everyone is moving forward together , then success takes care of itself . \" When it comes to teamwork , these feathered fliers are a soaring success !", "questions": "To protect themselves from attack , birds will", "options": {"model": ["fly in a ball - like formation", "change their direction", "come close together"], "human": ["break into groups", "fly up and down", "come close together"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
