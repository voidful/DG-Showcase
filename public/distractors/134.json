It was this glistening white thing standing up on the sand and I thought I was seeing things . \" The tale of the lost penguin is similar to the 2006 children ' s film Happy Feet , in which a young penguin finds himself far from home during a voyage of discovery . Conservationists believe it has completed an incredible journey for such a young bird - - it is estimated to be around 10 months old . The most likely explanation for its appearance in New Zealand is the hunt for food . Experts said it may also have rested on an ice floe during its travels and was carried north for a great distance before it made a swim for dry land .

Miskelly said the brave bird would have to find its way back south soon if it was going to survive .
