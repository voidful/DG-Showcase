{"id": "2658", "article": "What will you be doing when you are 26 years old ? Studying at university or working for a living ? Take a look at what Albert Einstein was doing at the age of 26 . 100 years ago , Einstein was working in Switzerland . His hobby was physics . Without much money or help , he wrote five papers for a physics magazine . Three of these greatly changed the study of physics and our understanding of space , time , light and matter . His most famous work is on the Theory of Relativity . Einstein was given the Nobel Prize for his discoveries . Although he also did many other things later , the years 1905 has been called Einstein ' s \" Year of Wonders \" . It has been 100 years since then . Because of this , the UN has named 05 the World Year of Physics . Today , over fifty years after Einstein ' s death , a question is asked , \" Will there ever be another Einstein ? \" It may take a long time . After all , Einstein was born more than 200 years after Sir Isaac Newton , another great scientist . Besides , physics is a different field now , and education is different , too . Even if you ca n ' t be the next great scientist , it is still helpful to remember some of the things that made Einstein great . He thought independently and read widely . He left with us a formula for life : If A is a success in life , then A = \" X + Y + Z . \" X is work , Y is play , and Z is keeping your mouth shut .", "questions": "The year 1905 is known as Einstein ' s \" Year of Wonders \" because", "options": {"model": ["einstein was the first to be called \" year of science \"", "albert einstein is a great scientist", "einstein made some very important discoveries in 1905", "einstein was the first scientist who got the nobel prize"], "human": ["Einstein was working in Switzerland in 1905", "Einstein was 26 years old in 1905", "Einstein studied physics in 1905", "Einstein made some very important discoveries in 1905"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
