{"id": "3739", "article": "The students were not exactly overjoyed that Steve Jobs was going to be the speaker . Everyone wanted Bill Clinton . After all , his daughter Chelsea had gone to school at Stanford . So every year that Clinton was not named speaker was a disappointment no matter who it was . Graduation is not in order . It was n ' t until we started walking into the stadium that I even realized that I ' m actually graduating right now . Stanford has this tradition , the wacky walk , where everyone dresses up in different clothes or throws Frisbees or beach balls . I ' m from the South so I had a seersucker suit shipped in from back home in Georgia . Some other guys dressed up as iPods . It was good fun . That was an interesting contrast to Job ' s speech . He started talking about being fired from Apple and then having cancer , how doctors told him he was going to die and how he was adopted as a baby into a family with parents who never went to college - - - an unusual experience that played out over his life . His speech was very raw and very open . He told us that he gets up every morning and looks in the mirror and asks \" If today were the last day of my life , would I want to do what I am about to do today ? \" \" If the answer is not for too many days in a row \" , he said , \" it ' s time to make a change . That has really driven a lot of my decisions since then . When I ' ve reached certain points in my job where I ' m not very excited to get to work early or stay late or work on something over the weekend or all night . When I lose that excitement then it ' s probably not the right thing for me anymore \" . He said , \" Your time is limited , so do n ' t waste it living someone else ' s life . \" Exactly . Death is a great motivator . You have to get out there and do something because some day you wo n ' t be there . Of all the advice I ' ve received I rely on that the most .", "questions": "From Job ' s speech we can learn", "options": {"model": ["he is a person who enjoys a lot of time", "he is a person who is thoughtful"], "human": ["his parents did n ' t want him to study in college", "he is a person who is thoughtful"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
