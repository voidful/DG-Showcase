And they will probably be friendly to people who talk nicely to them . Teachers also seem to get along better with children who take schoolwork seriously and prepare for class . And , just like any other human being , teachers like to be appreciated . The next time your teacher helps you solve a math problem or figure out a science project , say thank you with a smile . Talking to Parents - - Parents can be very supportive if their children ask for help . If you think there ' s something your parents can do to help you feel more comfortable around people , then ask them .

Maybe they had the same trouble when they were kids . Talking to Strangers - - This is always a tough one . How do you deal with a neighbor , or the mail carrier ? That often seems to cause arguments between kids and parents . The answer to these questions will vary from kid to kid , from parent to parent because all cultures are different .
