{"id": "3960", "article": "For the most part , it seems , workers in rich countries have little to fear from globalization , and a lot to gain . But is the same thing true for workers in poor countries ? The answer is that they are even more likely than their rich - country counterparts to benefit , because they have less to lose and more to gain . Traditional economics takes an optimistic line on integration and the developing countries . Openness to foreign trade and investment should encourage capital to flow to poor economies . In the developing world , capital is scarce , so the returns on investment there should be higher than in the industrialized countries , where the best opportunities to make money by adding capital to labour have already been used up . If poor countries lower their barriers to trade and investment , the theory goes , rich foreigners will want to send over some of their capital . If this inflow of resources arrives in the form of loans or portfolio investment , it will top up domestic savings and loosen the financial restriction on additional investment by local companies . If it arrives in the form of new foreign - controlled operations , FDI , so much the better : this kind of capital brings technology and skills from abroad packaged along with it , with less financial risk as well . In either case , the addition to investment ought to push incomes up , partly by raising the demand for labour and partly by making labour more productive . This is why workers in FDI - receiving countries should be in an even better position to profit from integration than workers in FDI - sending countries . Also , with or without inflows of foreign capital , the same gains from trade should apply in developing countries as in rich ones . This gains from trade logic often arouses suspicion , because the benefits seem to come from nowhere . Surely one side or the other must lose . Not so . The benefits that a rich country gets through trade do not come at the expense of its poor country trading partners , or vice versa . Recall that according to the theory , trade is a positive sum game . In all these trades , both sides - - exporters and importers , borrowers and lenders , shareholders and workers can gain .", "questions": "Why are workers in poor countries more likely to benefit from the process of globalization ?", "options": {"model": ["they have less to lose and more to gain .", "they are more likely to gain ."], "human": ["They can get more chances to gain a good job .", "They have less to lose and more to gain ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
