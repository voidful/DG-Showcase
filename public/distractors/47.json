{"id": "47", "article": "Blue - eyed people have been living in Europe for at least 7 , 000 years , scientists have discovered . A man who lived on the Iberian Peninsula before Europeans became farmers probably had blue eyes but dark hair and skin , according to scientists who have sequenced his DNA . This surprising combination of eye , hair and skin color1ing may not have been unusual during his lifetime , but it is no longer seen among modern Europeans , reported by the journal Nature . The man , a Neolithic hunter - gatherer known to scientists as La BranaI , is of great interest to scientists because he offers a snapshot of what was in Europeans ' DNA before agriculture spread through the continent . Experts have theorized that certain genetic feature spread quickly among humans after they adopted the farming lifestyle . La BranaI shows that at least some of their predictions were correct . The man ' s skeleton , along with that of a male companion , was discovered in 2006 in a cave in what is now northeastern Spain . The site , known as La Brana - Arintero , sits about 5 , 000 feet above sea level , and the cave provided a cold , refrigerator - like environment that preserved his DNA . In the lab , scientists were able to remove enough DNA from a single tooth to reconstruct La BranaI ' s entire genome . They compared it to the DNA of other ancient Europeans ( including Otzi , the 5 , 300 - year - old mummy found in an Alpine glacier ) and determined that he was a closer match with hunter - gatherers than with farmers . When it came to genes that would influence La BranaI ' s appearance , the researchers found that their 7 , OOO - year - old subject had versions of two skin pigment genes that are either very rare or nonexistent among Europeans today . Then they looked at other places in the genome that influence pigmentation and found a mix of ancient and modern gene variants . Taken together , La BranaI ' s DNA \" is likely to have resulted in dark skin pigmentation and dark or brown hair , \" they wrote . However , his DNA indicates that his eyes were most likely blue , the scientists found . This suggests that gene variants for", "questions": "Which of the following is TRUE ?", "options": {"model": ["the scientists have discovered a single tooth to reconstruct la braken it .", "la branai ' s dna influences his appearance .", "a new gene variant has been found in la braili .", "a new gene variant has been found in la braili ' s genes ."], "human": ["La BranaI ' s gene variants spread together .", "La BranaI ' s appearance influences contemporary Europeans .", "La BranaI ' s gene is completely different from the contemporary Europeans ' .", "La BranaI ' s DNA influences his appearance ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
