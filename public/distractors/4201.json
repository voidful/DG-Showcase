{"id": "4201", "article": "Last week , Chicago became the first city in the US to join the \" Lights Out Plan \" . People turned off the lights in the city ' s tallest buildings , so that thousands of birds could get to their winter homes . Every year in autumn , some birds fly over Chicago on their way to the south , and come back the next spring . Lights mean danger to birds . Birds find their way by looking at the stars in the sky . Lights in tall buildings are so bright that birds may mistake them as stars . This means they can not find the right way to go home . This month , about 300 types of birds are flying over Chicago to go back to the south to live through the cold winter . Birds fly to warmer places for a few reasons . Many birds can not live in the cold , so they fly to warmer places . But there are other reasons , too . Birds need to look for food in the south . Another reason is that they want to have baby birds . Many birds like to have their baby birds in the same \" house \" they lived in last year , so they fly back there . There are about 9 , 000 kinds of birds in the world , and about 600 kinds of birds _ . Some birds can fly a very long way . Sometimes they fly to other countries . We have fewer birds today because there are fewer places for birds .", "questions": "Why did people in Chicago turn off their lights last week ?", "options": {"model": ["because people were a afraid that birds would lose their way .", "because people wanted to have baby birds in the same house ."], "human": ["Because people were a afraid that birds would make much noise .", "Because people were a afraid that birds would lose their way ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
