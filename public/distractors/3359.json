{"id": "3359", "article": "Speech - - the act of uttering sounds to convey meaning - - is a kind of human action . Like any other constantly repeated action , speaking has to be learned , but once it is learned , it becomes a generally unconscious and apparently automatic process . As far as we can determine , human beings do not need to be forced to speak ; most babies seem to possess a sort of instinctive drive to produce speech like noises . How to speak and what to say are another matter altogetner . There actions are learned from the particular society into which the baby is born ; so that , like all conduct that is learned from a society - - from the people around us - - speech is a patterned activity . The meandering babble and chatter of a young child are eventually channeled by imitation into a few orderly grooves that represent the pattern accepted as meaningful by the people around him . Similarly , a child ' s indiscriminate practice of putting things into his mouth becomes limited to putting food into his mouth in a certain way . The sounds that a child can make are more varied and numerous than the sounds that any particular language uses . However , a child born into a society with a pattem of language is encouraged to make a small selection of sounds and to make these few sounds over and over until it is natural for him to make these sounds and not others .", "questions": "The selection says that most babies have an instinctive drive to", "options": {"model": ["make speech like noise", "make speech like noises"], "human": ["imitate sounds around them", "make speech like noise"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
