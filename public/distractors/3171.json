{"id": "3171", "article": "Going to school means learning new skills and facts in different subjects . Teachers teach and students learn , and many scientists are interested in finding ways to improve both teaching and learning processes . Sian Beilock and Susan Leving , two psychologists at the University of Chicago , are trying to learn about learning . In a new study about the way kids learn math in primary school , Beilock and Levine found a surprising relationship between what female teachers think and what female students learn : If a female teacher is uncomfortable with her own math skills , then her female students are more likely to believe that boys are better than girls at math . \" If these girls keep getting math - anxious female teachers in later grades , _ , \" Levine told Science News . The study suggests that if these girls grow up believing that boys are better at math than girls are , then these girls may not do as well as they would have if they were more confident . Just as students find certain subjects to be difficult , teachers can find certain subjects to be difficult to learn - - and teach . The subject of math can be particularly difficult for everyone . The new study involved 65 girls , 52 boys and 17 first - and second - grade teachers in primary schools in the Midwest . The students took math achievement tests at the beginning and end of the school year , and the researchers compared the scores . The researchers also gave the students tests to tell whether the students believed a math superstar had to be a boy . Then the researchers turned to the teachers : To find out which teachers were anxious about math , the researchers asked the teachers how they felt at times when they came across math , such as when reading a sales receipt . A teacher who got nervous looking at the numbers on a sales receipt , for example , was probably anxious about math . Boys , on average , were unaffected by a teacher ' s anxiety . On average , girls with math - anxious teachers scored lower on the end - of - the - year math tests than other girls in the study did . Plus , on the test showing whether someone thought a math superstar had to be a boy , 20 girls showed feeling that boys would be better at math - - and all of these girls had been taught by female teachers with math anxiety .
