Now , a study has found that while this is certainly true , men also have to deal with the fact that they are also more stupid than the fairer sex . In the study , scientists measured the IQ of 2500 brothers and sisters and they found an uneven number of men not only in the top two percent , but also in the bottom two percent . The study ' s participants were tested on science , maths , English and mechanical abilities . Though there were twice as many men as women in the smartest group , there were also twice as many men among the foolish . The total scores of men and women were similar . One of the study ' s authors , psychology professor Timothy Bates , said that the phenomenon may be because men have always been expected to be high achievers and women have been restricted to spend more time taking care of their home . \" The female developmental program may be tilted more towards ensuring survival and the safety of the middle ground . \" the Daily Mail quoted Professor Bates , of Edinburgh University , as saying . The research agrees with past results that men were more likely than women to receive first class University degrees or thirds and women secured the seconds . It has been said that men are more ready to take a risk when it comes to academics . While women have always been found to be steadier in their learning . A past study has shown that women are securing more firsts and seconds , while men are continuing to receive more thirds . The argument for the change is that the increase of coursework at the cost of exams favors women ' s steady approach .", "questions": "The reason for the change that women are securing more firsts and seconds is that .", "options": {"model": ["women ' s steady approach is more suitable for the exams", "men tend to take a risk than women to receive first class university degrees", "women can get higher scores in exams", "women are more clever than men in the fairer sex"], "human": ["More women are growing like men", ". higher expectation is given to more women", "More women have the chance to receive first class university", "Women ' s steady approach is more suitable for the exams"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
