{"id": "1588", "article": "A letter to Edward , a columnist Dear Mr . Expert , I grew up in an unhappy and abusive home . I always promised myself that I ' d get out as soon as possible . Now , at age 20 , I have a good job and a nice house , and I ' m really proud of the independence I ' ve achieved . Here ' s the problem : several of my friends who still live with their parents wish they had places like mine - - so much so that they make mine theirs . It started out with a couple of them spending the weekends with me . But now they seem to take it for granted that they can show up any time they like . They bring boyfriends over , talk on the phone and stay out forever . I enjoy having my friends here sometimes - - it makes the place feel comfortable and warm - - but this is my home , not a party house . I was old enough to move out on my own , so why ca n ' t I seem to ask my friends to respect my privacy ? Joan Edward ' s reply to Joan Dear Joan , If your family did n ' t pay attention to your needs when you were a child , you probably have trouble letting others know your needs now . And if you ' ve gathered your friends around you to rebuild a happy family atmosphere , you may fear that saying no will bring back the kind of conflict you grew up with - - or destroy the nice atmosphere you now enjoy . You need to understand that in true friendship it ' s okay to put your own needs first from time to time . Be clear about the message you want to send . For example , \" I really love your company but I also need some privacy . So please call before you come over . \" Edward", "questions": "60 .
