{"id": "1820", "article": "Once upon a time , there was a lovely vegetable field , on which grew a very thick tree . Both the vegetables and the tree gave the place a wonderful appearance , which was the joy of the garden ' s owner . What no one knew was that the vegetables in the field and the tree could n ' t stand each other . The vegetables hated the tree ' s shadow , because it left them only just enough light to survive . The tree , on the other hand , hated the vegetables because they drank nearly all the water before it could get to him , leaving him with just enough to survive . The situation became so extreme that the vegetables got totally fed up and decided to use up all the water in the ground so that the tree would dry up . The tree answered back by refusing to give the vegetables shadow from the hot midday sun , so they both began to dry up . Before long , the vegetables were really thin and the tree ' s branches were drying up . Neither of them thought that the gardener , on seeing his vegetable field becoming worse , would stop watering it . When he did that , both the tree and the vegetables really learned what thirst was . There seemed to be no solution , but one of the vegetables , a small courgette , understood what was going on , and decided to deal with it . Despite the little water and the unbearable heat , the little courgette did all he could to grow , grow . . . He managed to grow so big that the gardener started watering the field again . The gardener wanted to enter that beautiful big courgette in some gardening contest . And so the vegetables and the tree realized that it was better to help each other than to fight . They should really learn how to live in harmony with those around them , doing the best they could . So they decided to work together , using both the shadow and the water in the best combination to grow good vegetables . Seeing how well they were doing , the gardener now gave the best of care to his vegetable field , watering it better than any other field for miles around .", "questions": "The courgette thought of ways to solve the conflict by", "options": {"model": ["growing big enough", "watering the gardener ' s vegetable field", "watering the garden field"], "human": ["making peace with the tree", "working together with other vegetables", "growing big enough"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
