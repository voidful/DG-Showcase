{"id": "1541", "article": "Liu Jiaoyang , 16 , carefully winds a bobbin with thread , places it on her sewing machine and then presses her foot down to begin sewing . While she ' s doing this , she pretends to guide cloth through the machine . Each Tuesday afternoon , after the bell rings for the fourth period , Liu becomes a fashion designer . At the same time , the rest of the students at the High School Attached to Yunnan Normal University in Kunming are also having classes a little bit different from the usual ones . Some students dance , others create robots , and still others review films . These are just a few of the 28 elective courses the school began to offer last month . \" The fashion design class has become the bright point of my week . I learn how to choose color1s and cloth as well as sewing and sketching skills . It ' s all helping me to realize the dream of becoming a fashion designer I ' ve had since I was a little girl , \" Liu said . Design is Liu ' s passion , but for other students the electives are more an opportunity to take a fun course that relieves the pressures of schoolwork . Some students , for example , are learning how to play bridge . Chen Xiejiao , 15 , is one of them . \" Many people think that playing a card game like this in class is a waste of time . But in fact , bridge is a very challenging game that helps develop memory and math skills , \" she said . Li Ke , 15 , is studying robotics . \" I hope to have built and designed my own robot by the end of the semester . It will be able to complete a task , like moving a bail from one place to another , \" he said .", "questions": "Which do you think is the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["liu jiaoyang ' s class .", "our time to choose ."], "human": ["Three Students in the High School Attached to Yunnan Normal University .", "Our Time to Choose ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
