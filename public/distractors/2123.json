{"id": "2123", "article": "Solar water heaters can use energy from the sun to heat water . They are used around the world . The solar water heater is based on a design developed some years ago in Afghanistan . Since then , it has been built and used in many countries . It can heat seventy liters of water to 60degC . It can do this between sunrise and noon on a clear day with an average temperature of 32degC . There are two parts of the solar water heater . One part , the collector , is made of a metal plate painted black . This metal surface , placed in contact with the water , will heat the water . Black - painted surfaces that receive the sun ' s heat become hotter than those of any other color1 . Metal plates that have raised parts on the surface work better than those without them . Once the water is heated , it is kept hot with special material , which allows the water to stay warm for a long time . The second part of the solar water heater holds the water for the system . This water tank can hold about one hundred liters of water . Two rubber pipes are connected to the water tank . One pipe lets water go into the system . The other lets water go out . When the water heater is working correctly , water will flow from the tank to the collector and back again . You can use the hot water at the top of the tank for washing and cleaning . This solar water heater is easy to build and operate . It will last about two years before the rubber pipes need to be replaced .", "questions": "The color1 of the collector is black because", "options": {"model": ["it can take in more energy than other color1s", "it can use a special material to heat water"], "human": ["it is good for protecting the metal surface", "it can take in more energy than other color1s"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
