{"id": "3196", "article": "The traditional distinction between products that satisfy needs and those satisfy wants is no longer adequate to describe classes of products . In today ' s prosperous societies , the distinction has become unclear because so many wants have been turned into needs . A writer , for instance , can work with paper and pencils . These are legal needs for the task . But the work can be done more quickly and efficiently with a word processor . Thus a computer is soon viewed as a need rather than a want . In the field of marketing , consumer goods are classed according to the way in which they are purchased . The two main classes are convenience goods and shopping goods . Two lesser types are specialty goods and unsought goods . It must be emphasized that all of these types are based on the way shoppers think about products , not on the nature of the products themselves . What is regarded as a convenience item in France ( wine , for example ) should be a specialty goods in the United States . People do not spend a great deal of time shopping for such convenience items as groceries , newspapers , toothpaste , aspirin , and candy . The buying of convenience goods may be done routinely , as some families buy groceries once a week . Such regularly purchased items are called staples . Sometimes convenience products are bought without enough thinking ; someone has a sudden desire for an ice cream sundae on a hot day . Or they may be purchased as emergency items . Shopping goods are items for which customers search . They compare prices . quality , and styles , and may visit a number of stores before making a decision . Buying an automobile is often done this way . Shopping goods fail into two classes : those that are recognized as basically the same and those that are regarded as different . Items that are looked upon as basically the same include such things as home appliances , television sets , and automobiles . Having decided on the model desired , the customer is primarily interested in getting the item at the most favorable price . Items regarded as essentially different include clothing , furniture , and dishes . Quality , style and fashion will either take precedence over price , or they win not matter at all .", "questions": "The example of wine is used to illustrate that", "options": {"model": ["one product is more attractive than the same", "the type of a product is determined by its consumers", "the price of a product depends on the quality"], "human": ["goods are classified differently in different counties", "one product may belong to many types", "the type of a product is determined by its consumers"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
