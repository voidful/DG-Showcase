{"id": "2023", "article": "One baby born with a defective windpipe now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3 - D printing technology , NPR reported . Garrett Peterson , now 18 months old , was born with tracheomalacia , leaving him unable to breathe . The condition terrified his parents , who turned to specialist Dr . Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment . Along with Scott Hollister , a biomedical engineer who runs the university ' s 3 - D printing lab , Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett ' s windpipe until it ' s strong enough to function independently . After taking a CT scan of Garrett ' s windpipe to make a replica of it , they made the \" splint \" with a 3 - D printer . \" It ' s like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe , and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly , \" Green told NPR . On January 31 , Garrett had his surgery . Surgeon Dr . Richard Ohye opened up Garrett ' s chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white - - a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies . After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett ' s windpipe , it was time for the big test : What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett ' s lungs ? Though he still remains in the hospital , Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery . His parents are overjoyed , saying he ' s starting to act more interactive and alert . As Garrett grows , the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently . 3 - D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow . \" We ' re talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts , \" Green said . \" And we ' re able to do things that were never possible before . \"", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["garrett ' s condition is critical .", "he has got stronger and needs less treatment .", "chris ' s parents have been in charge of his research .", "a 3 - d printing technology can be used in the hospital ."], "human": ["Garrett is out of hospital with the help of 3 - D printing technology .", "The splint will exist in Garrett ' s body for ever .", "It is difficult to operate the 3 - D printer .", "Garrett ' s condition is critical ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
