{"id": "2805", "article": "As a young woman who was always interested in style , I got lucky in interning with a fashion company in Tokyo , last summer . I worked as an assistant in the Business Planning Department , helping with marketing for the 2007 Spring / Summer collections . Fashion is a beautiful industry . But against my expectation , it also has lots of ordinary work . Every day , I would do sample testing , prepare the brochure for future launches , and meet with customers and visitors . Japanese companies had a traditional work style . We had a meeting every morning at 9 o ' clock . Every Monday , all employees , including those in other parts ofprefix = st1 / Japan , would take part in a conference call . Every afternoon , after finishing work , each of us would say goodbye to every manager in the company , which took more than five minutes . All of this kept me fresh . And the strict work atmosphere caused me to work harder . At the end of last August , the company ' s 2007 Spring / Summer collection started with a big show and was very successful . Lots of customers showed an interest in our products , including a businessman from Hong Kong . He went to our company for more details on the products , but he could n ' t speak Japanese and none of the staff spoke good English . Just when the situation seemed helpless , I offered to give it a try . I was a Japanese major , but I had also practiced my English often . My translation job was praised by both the customer and my boss . And the guest made a big purchase . The two - month internship taught me a lot about business . And the pay - 150 , 000 yen , or over 10 , 000 yuan a month - was enough to cover my daily living costs inTokyo . Moreover , the experience made me stand out . Every interviewer I ' ve spoken with showed an interest and discussed my internship with me . And thanks to this experience , I ' ve found a good job in one of the Big Four accounting firms and will start working this summer .", "questions": "What can you learn from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["internship usually plays an important role in finding a good job .", "most japanese companies have traditional work styles ."], "human": ["Japanese are good at spoken English .", "Internship usually plays an important role in finding a good job ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
