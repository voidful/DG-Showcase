{"id": "5058", "article": "Dear Earthmen , I enjoy my stay on your interesting planet . I think I know the life on Earth now and I would like to tell you my ideas . First of all you live in boxes . Every morning you leave your boxes and get into smaller boxes on wheels . All these small boxes run around and around , and finally stop to rest . You leave these boxes on wheels and go to very large tall boxes . After resting all day , you get back in your little boxes . There you sit and look at very small _ boxes with moving pictures in them . There is only one thing I do n ' t know . Some angry boys fought for a little round ball . Everyone shouted but they kept fighting . They were angry , because they had to stay in boxes all day , I think . Thank you for this chance to get to know you . Yours , The man from Mars", "questions": "What ' s the main idea of the letter ?", "options": {"model": ["to tell the earthmen what they are like .", "to tell the earthmen what the earth is like .", "to tell the story about the earthmen ' s life ."], "human": ["To tell the Earthmen he does n ' t like the Earth .", "To tell the Earthmen he is leaving the Earth soon .", "To tell the Earthmen what the Earth is like ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
