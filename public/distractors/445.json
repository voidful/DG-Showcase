The children do n ' t just plan any city . They map and analyze the housing , energy , and transportation requirements of their own district and foretell its needs in 100 years . With the aid of an architect who visits the classroom once a week , they invent new ways to meet these needs and build models of their creations . \" Designing buildings of the future gives children a lot of freedom , \" says the teacher who developed this program . \" They are able to use their own rich imagination and inventions without fear of blame , because there are no wrong answers in a future context . In fact , as the class enters the final model - building stage of the program , an elected \" official \" and \" planning group \" make all the design decisions for the model city , and the teacher steps back and becomes an adviser . \" CBEP is a set of activities , games , and imitations that teach the basic steps necessary for problem - solving ; observing , analyzing , working out possible answers , and judging them based on the children ' s own standards .", "questions": "The children feel free in the program because", "options": {"model": ["they need n ' t create a new way to meet the needs", "they need not worry about making mistakes", "they need n ' t think about their ideas"], "human": ["they can design future buildings themselves", "they are given enough time to design models", "they need not worry about making mistakes"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
