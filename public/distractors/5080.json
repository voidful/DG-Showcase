After making this list , you should make a schedule of your time . First set your time for eating , sleeping , dressing , etc . Then decide a good , regular time for studying . Do n ' t forget to set aside enough time for entertainment . A weekly schedule may not solve all your problems , but it will force you to realize what is happening to your time . Find a good place to study . Look around the house for a good study area . Keep this space , which may be a desk or simply a corner of your room , free of everything but study materials . No games , radios , or television ! When you sit down to study , concentrate on the subject . Make good use of your time in class . Take advantage of class time to listen to everything the teachers say . Really listening in class means less work later . Taking notes will help you remember what the teacher says . Study regularly .
