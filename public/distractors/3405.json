{"id": "3405", "article": "The smallest animal with a backbone known to science , a fish from the carp family , has been discovered in the peat swamps of Indonesia . Mature females of the fish species Paedocypris reach just 7 . 9 mm in length . The species was discovered in the highly acidic peat swamps of the Indonesian island of Sumatra by a team led by Ralf Britz , a zoologist at the Natural History Museum in London . \" This is one of the strangest fish that I ' ve seen in my whole career , \" Dr Britz said . \" It ' s tiny , and it lives in acid . I hope that we ' ll have time to find out more about them before their habitat disappears completely . \" The species lives in dark tea - colored swamp waters , which are 100 times more acidic than rainwater . Although these swamps were once thought to be inhabited by very few animals , recent research has shown that they are home to a highly different range of species that occur nowhere else . The peat swamps were damaged by forest fires in 1997 , and are also threatened by agriculture . The scientists behind the discovery said that several populations of Paedocypris had already been lost . \" Many of the peat swamps we surveyed throughout South - East Asia no longer exist , \" Dr Britz said . \" Populations of all the miniature fish of peat swamps have decreased or disappeared . \" Details of the discovery are published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society of London , Series B .", "questions": "65 .
