{"id": "3030", "article": "I am a single working mother and going to college for a better life for my three - year - old child and myself . I am taking a nurse course called \" Urban Community \" . We were asked to do a major project on problems in urban communities . I chose the topic \" Homeless \" . Each day I would walk down the streets of the homeless and offer them something to drink and to eat . I know it ' s tough to survive on the streets . Last night I ran into a group of 30 kids who were living on the streets in New York . _ and I just wanted to cry . But I had to be strong . I asked about their families and if they contacted them to let them know they were alive . Most of them said , \" NO ! \" They all looked like a happy family and they took care of one another . I tried to persuade them to get help and to contact their families but they did not want to . I did not want to make them to do it as they had their own reasons . All these kids were very respectful . None of them was high on drugs nor were they drinking . Some of them enjoyed reading and writing . Some of them enjoyed skateboarding , dancing and playing music . One girl asked me if I could give her a hug and I did so . She started to cry and said , \" Thank you for not treating us as freaks like everyone else does . People do n ' t realize that we all have our own problems and some are worse than others . \" She told me that her stepfather was extremely mean to her and her mother did not believe her . She ran away . Her street name was Little Mary . They were good kids just trying to make ends meet . I told them that I did n ' t have much to offer because I was a single mother just making ends meet . I had offered them sandwiches and drinks . They were so happy to have something to eat and told me that I could n ' t change the world but at least there was someone who really cared .", "questions": "What ' s the best title for this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["life in the homeless family", "care for the homeless kids", "the homeless kids"], "human": ["A Story of a Single Mother", "How to Survive on the Streets", "Care for the Homeless Kids"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
