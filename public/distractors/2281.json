If you ' re looking for a symbol of Britain , only one thing passes the test - the umbrella . Now , I know what you ' re thinking - - we have rain in China and we have umbrellas too . Certainly , I will never forget the way it rained when I lived in Beijing : the sweets became instant rivers and the sky flashed with lightning for hours on end .
