But does this mean more and more people are getting into reading the digital way ? According to the National Reading Survey , before the 17thWorld Reading Day on April 23 , only 1 . 2 percent of Chinese people said they read a lot . But 38 . 6 percent said they read on digital devices like cell phone and e - books . This is a 17 . 7 percent increase from 2010 . Many experts are talking about a trend toward fragmented reading - - reading many short messages or items on a digital device like a cell phone instead of one long text in a book . Zhao jianmin , a professor at Shanghai University , said fragmented reading was part of modern life . \" The fast _ of life leaves many people no time to sit and read a whole book , \" he said . \" So making use of fragmented time to read is sure to be a trend \" Fragmented reading has its advantages . People can enjoy large amounts of information , knowledge and entertainment in a short time . Digital reading is faster than traditional deep reading . However , some experts fear the trend of digital reading will lead people to read in a simple way . Xu Guosheng , at a Chinese Academy of Press and Publication , says fragmented reading makes it harder for people to think more about what they read . He also warned fragmented reading could make people lazy about remembering facts because they know they can always just search for answers online . \" Fragmented reading is sometimes good , but do n ' t let it take all your time , \" suggested Tian Zhilng , an editor . He said it was important to read quality books in a deeper way , and we should read for knowledge , for practical use and for pleasure . He suggested people choose easy books first , then move onto more difficult ones .", "questions": "What can we learn from the article ?", "options": {"model": ["people can read on electronic devices .", "people ' s reading habits are changing .", "digital devices are more and more widely used .", "digital devices are better than traditional deep reading ."], "human": ["Chinese people read in a simple way these days .", "Students should read more to get high marks .", "Reading on a digital device is harmful to health .", "People ' s reading habits are changing ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
