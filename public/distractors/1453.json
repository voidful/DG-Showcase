{"id": "1453", "article": "When a dirty and untidy orange cat showed up in the prison yard , I was one of the first to go out there and pet it . I had n ' t touched a cat or a dog in over 20 years . I spent at least 20 minutes , knelt down behind the kitchen as the cat rolled around , relaxed . What he was expressing outwardly , I was feeling inwardly . It was an amazing bit of grace to feel him under my hand and note that I was reaching a life or another creature with something as simple as my care . Over the next few days , there were other prisoners responding to the cat . Every yard period , a group of prisoners gathered there . They stood around talking and taking turns petting the cat . These were guys you would n ' t usually find talking to each other . Several times I saw an officer in the group , not chasing people away , but just watching and seeming to enjoy along with the prisoners . Bowls of milk and water appeared along with bread , wisely placed under the edge of the dustbin to keep the birds from getting it . The cat was obviously homeless and in pretty bad shape . People said that the cat came to the right place . He ' s getting treated like a king . This was true . but as 1 watched 1 was also thinking about what the cat was doing for us . There was a lot of talk about what ' s wrong with prisons in America . We need more programs . We need more psychologists or treatment of various kinds . Some may even talk about making prisons more kind . But I think what we really need is a chance to practise our own kindness . Not receive it , but give it . After more than two decades here , I know kindness is not a value that ' s encouraged . It ' s often seen as a weakness . Instead , the culture encourages keeping your head down , minding your own business , and never letting yourself be weak . The cat did my heart good to see the effect he had on me and the men here . By simply saying , \" I need some help here \" , he did something important for us . He needed us . And we needed to be needed . I believe we all do .", "questions": "What is the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["everyone needs care .", "prison culture is important .", "animals are needed by animals .", "caring makes us human ."], "human": ["Prison Culture is Important .", "Animals Need Care .", "Everyone Needs to be Cared for .", "Caring Makes Us Human ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
