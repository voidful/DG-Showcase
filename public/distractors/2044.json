{"id": "2044", "article": "The days of the sneak thief who stole a couple of apples or a packet of sweets from a chain store are actually over . I had a chance to say this to a young offender the other day , \" Sweets from a chain store ? \" He said , \" You must be joking . That ' s what kids do . \" I may add that he was aged 11 . In other words , today ' s young criminals would find it laughable to risk being caught for petty theft of this description . They ' ve got enough money in their pockets to buy the sweets they want , anyway . I think it ' s all too easy to put the blame on anyone but ourselves . Faced as they are with a society that frequently gives them up on the grounds of color1 , race or low learning ability , these children turn to crime as a means of showing off their self - respect . Nurtured on films and TV glamorizing the role of the criminal , they are quick to copy these anti - heroes . It is a matter of increasing concern to the police and government that the Children and Young Persons Act , 1969 , is becoming improper to deal with the rise in young criminals . Because the emphasis has been placed on the cause and gentle treatment of their crimes , rather than on old - fashioned methods of punishment , the children themselves know well that there is very little that can be done to prevent them continuing to steal , damage and in some case even cause the death of those they choose to terrorize . I do n ' t like the look of this situation any more than you do . In our own interests and in those of our children and grandchildren , we can not continue to take the \" it ' s nothing to do with me \" attitude we have used for so long . We must unite in a common demand for harder and stricter methods against these young criminals .", "questions": "Psychologically speaking , the reason why some youngsters commit crimes is that", "options": {"model": ["they think it a way of showing their self - respect", "they think it ' s unnecessary to put the blame on anyone but themselves"], "human": ["they are good at imitating the criminals in the films", "they think it a way of showing their self - respect"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
