After its first man in space , China plans a space laboratory , a lunar orbiter to look for valuable elements and minerals , robot landings on the moon and then the human touchdown . The price of space exploration is enormous . Russia and the US , the only two countries to have achieved manned flight , are struggling to keep their new investment , the international space station . But China , which has a long tradition in physics , mathematics and engineering , finds its doctoral graduates welcomed in the US and Europe for decades . And it has been able to learn from 40 years of pioneering successes and mistakes by the USSR and the USA . Space flight is a gamble and the stakes are high . If successful , China could become a member of the world ' s most exclusive club , set up a second home on the moon and get a powerful hand at the strategic bargaining table . Two designers from the Shenzhou III project said that 12 astronauts now are undergoing intensive training . One more unmanned space flight is planned before the first manned launch . Experts say that the Shenzhou spacecraft already provides China with a space vehicle capable of mounting a lunar program . Chinese scientists have also predicted that Mars will be the next target after the moon .", "questions": "We think that the Chinese astronaut will succeed in landing the moon in 2010 because", "options": {"model": ["china has its tradition technology and advanced scientists", "china plans a space lab and a manned lab", "china wants to be the only country to make its first exploration of the moon", "china plans a space lab"], "human": ["China will ask for help from the USSR and the USA", "two countries have set up a space station on the moon", "China has a large population in the world", "China has its tradition technology and advanced scientists"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
