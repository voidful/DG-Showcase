{"id": "49", "article": "An old man was fishing by a river . A child was watching him . The old man was really good at fishing and it did n ' t take him much time to catch a basket of fish . The old man saw that the child was very cute , and he wanted to give her a whole basket of fish . But the child shook her head . The old man was surprised and asked \" Why do n ' t you want the fish ? \" The child replied , \" I want the fishing rod in your hands . \" The old man asked , \" Why do you want the rod ? \" \" It wo n ' t take long to eat all the fish in the basket . But if I have the fishing rod , I can go fishing by myself and I wo n ' t be afraid of not having any fish to eat . \" I think you will certainly say that the girl is very smart . Wrong ! If she does n ' t know how to fish , she can not have fish to eat , even though she has the fishing rod . It ' s useless to only have a fishing rod . Fishing skills are the most important , not the fishing rod . Too many people think that if they have a \" fishing rod \" in their life , they will no longer fear the difficulties in life . They are just like the child , who thought that if she had a fishing rod , she would have fish to eat .", "questions": "Why did the child refuse to get the fish ?", "options": {"model": ["because she did n ' t want the fish .", "because she wanted the old man to give her a whole basket of fish .", "because the old man did n ' t like it .", "because she wanted the old man ' s fishing rod ."], "human": ["Because the fish was not enough .", "Because she did n ' t like eating fish .", "Because the fish was too small .", "Because she wanted the old man ' s fishing rod ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
