{"id": "4999", "article": "The red phone box in Britain is a perfect example of the British traditional culture . However , with the fast development of mobile phones , it has lost its place in people ' s everyday life . In order to save their loved red phone boxes , people have come up with many ideas , for example , to turn them into toilets or art houses . In a village in Somerset , a place in South West England , villagers have found a new way to save their red phone box . They turned it into a mini library to deal with the shortage of libraries in their area . The idea was given by a local villager , Janet Fisher , who lives opposite the phone box . Villagers got together to set up the book box . Over 100 books and a lot of movies and music CDs are available at this mini library . The books are of different kinds , including from cooking books to the classics and children ' s books . People can put the books that they have read inside the phone box , and take away the books that they ' d like to read . The books are always changing . There is a regular check on the books to keep the phone box collection fresh . Anyone is free to come to read books there . The phone box library is open every day around the clock and is lit ( the past form of \" light \" ) at night . \" It ' s very pleasing that the red phone box has been saved . More importantly , it can continue providing a service for us , \" said one of the villagers .", "questions": "People in Somerset turned the red phone box into a mini library to", "options": {"model": ["save people ' s lives", "help people save their loved red phone boxes", "help solve the shortage of library service"], "human": ["provide a place to exchange ideas", "make the collection of the local library larger", "help solve the shortage of library service"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
