And our ancestors already understood it well . \" It takes an entire village to raise a child . \" That ' s an old proverb that is being quoted more and more often these days . And I ' m pleased about that . Today , more and more schools are reaching out to involve parents , community members and businesses to help shape a child ' s future . Parents need to be involved in their children ' s education in many ways . Helping children with homework and studying , going on a field trip , teaching a craft or coaching a child ' s sports team are all great ways to be involved with your child ' s education . And do n ' t forget to communicate with teachers - - they need and respect your input . Studies show that children learn more and schools function better when parents and schools work together . It ' s important to stay in touch with your child ' s education all through his or her school career . Communities can help children create and achieve new goals . Help with homework , read to a child , coach a children ' s team , or provide emotional support . Help solve problems and build self - esteem . Kids need role models and advisers can be role models by sharing their experiences and wisdom . Businesses can also help shape our children ' s future . invite a class from your local school to visit your workplace . You may be providing a glimpse that opens a new world of possibilities . Show students what goes on during a typical day . Give a mini course for students : how to use a computer ; how products are made ; how machinery works . You may have a developing electrician , teacher , nurse , or even a newspaper reporter on your hands . It really does take an entire village to raise a child . So share the responsibility - - and the joy - - of bringing a child to his or her full potential .", "questions": "The implied advice in the proverb \" It takes an entire village to raise a child . \" is that", "options": {"model": ["parents and schools work together for a child ' s future", "parents and schools work together", "parents and schools work together for a child", "more than one party is responsible for a child ' s future"], "human": ["All the people in a village should give food to a child", "Children should be brought up in the village where they were born", "Schools should be set up in the village where a child was raised", "More than one party is responsible for a child ' s future"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
