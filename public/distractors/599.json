{"id": "599", "article": "Of all the animals in the animal kingdom , which one ( aside from man ) is the cleverest ? There are several ways of measuring the intelligence of animals . In one test a scientist sets three same cans on a table . While the animal watches , he puts food under one of the cans . Then he leads the animal away . Some time later , he brings it back to see if it remembers which can has the food . No smelling is allowed ; the animal must go directly to the correct can or it fails . This is called a delayed - response test . The idea is to find out how long an animal ' s memory can keep information . The scientists would try showing the cans to the animal one hour later , or two hours later , or even a full day later . They discovered that chimpanzees and elephants have the best memory , and were able to remember the correct can for at least twenty hours . No other animal is close . Dogs came next , but they only remember for nine hours . To settle the matter , the scientists designed a huge maze and ran the chimps and elephants through it . The maze was very difficult , with many blind paths and dead ends . It took the chimps ten minutes to find their way out . The elephants needed half an hour . Even allowing for the elephants ' slower rate of speed , the test shows that chimpanzees are the cleverest animals . From this and other tests , the scientists drew the following conclusion : an animal ' s intelligence depends on the size of its brain in proportion to the size of its body . The elephant ' s brain weighs ten pounds . But this is only 1 / 600th of its 6 , 000 pounds body . A chimp ' s brain weighs about one pound , or 1 / 120th of its total body weight . So in proportion to its body size , the chimp has four times as much brain as the elephant - - - - more brain for less body . The chimp is the champ !", "questions": "The passage tells that elephants", "options": {"model": ["are more cleverer than chimps", "are more clever than chimps in their intelligence", "are slower - moving than chimps"], "human": ["are more clever than chimps", "have better memories than chimps", "are slower - moving than chimps"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
