But soon the shoes will be sent to poor children in the United States and 20 other countries , thanks to Woodburn ' s Share Our Soles ( S . O . S . ) charity . A high school track star in the town of Ventura , California , Woodburn was treated in hospital for months with knee and hip injuries . \" I started thinking about the health benefits , the friendship and the confidence I got from running , \" he says , \" And I realized there are children who do n ' t even have shoes . \" Woodburn gathered up his old sneakers , then asked his friends to donate .

Woodburn has now set up collection boxes at two high schools , city gym and recreation center . He has started accepting adult sizes and sandals . So far , S . O . S has collected and donated more than 3 , 000 pairs . Woodburn has cleaned all the shoes . After sorting the shoes by size , Woodburn selects the good shoes for the washing machine and the worn - out ones for recycling .
