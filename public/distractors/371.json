The company , based in the northern Spanish city of Sofia , uses deserted cars that still work . Heavy - metal music is used to excite the clients . They are given protective suits and glasses , helmets and huge hammers . Most people ' s rage only lasts for 5 to 10 minutes . But some go on for hours : they beat cars on which they ' ve put the names of people or ideas they would like to get rid of . \" Some even get together to turn the car over , \" Arribas says .
