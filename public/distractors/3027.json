{"id": "3027", "article": "Maps of the world ' s population show that the majority of people today live near water . We live along coastlines , around bays , up the course of rivers and streams and on islands . We also vacation at the beach and find comfort fishing on a lake . Nothing makes small children happier than the chance of playing in water . More surprisingly , this human favor for water makes evolutionary sense . Sure , we need drinking water to live , but we have also benefited from what ' s swimming under the waves . Neuroscientist Crawford of the University of North London has proposed that our ancient ancestors attached to the sea , and that their devotion paid off by allowing the human species to develop large and complex brains . Crawford claims that when humans separated from apes and appeared in the forests of Africa , they stuck close to rivers and beaches and started catching fish , clams and crabs . That seafood was packed with omega - 3 fatty acids , essential fatty acids that promote brain cell growth . It ' s no coincidence , Crawford claims , that human brain growth began to increase rapidly once we left the woods and headed for the beach . Scientists have also discovered that people who eat fish regularly are less likely to suffer from depression than those who eat less seafood . Biochemist Hibbelin of the National Institutes of Health has shown that across cultures there is a direct link between amount of fish eaten each week and rates of depression . More interestingly , Hibbelin and researcher Laura have found that fish is commonly used as a symbol of happiness and good health in various religions and cultures . We know that fish and the sea are good for us , and so we seek them out . We vacation on the coast and see the waves come and go , feeling happiness has taken over our brain . When we move inland , or go home from vacation , we lose touch with our sea roots and feel unhappy .", "questions": "What can we infer from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["it ' s natural for people to live in the sea .", "it ' s natural for human beings to live near water .", "it ' s human nature to seek out bodies of water .", "people who eat less fish may suffer from depression ."], "human": ["It ' s good to our health to swim under the waves .", "Human has the largest and most complex brains .", "Beach is the best destination of vacation .", "It ' s human nature to seek out bodies of water ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
