{"id": "2612", "article": "There is no better way to enjoy Scottish traditions than going fishing and tasting a little bit of whisky at a quiet place like the Inverlochy Castle . When Queen Victoria visited the castle in 1873 , she wrote in her diary , \" I never saw a lovelier spot , \" And she did n ' t even go fishing . Scotland is not easily defined . In certain moments , this quiet land of lakes and grasses and mountains changes before your very eyes . When evening gently sweeps the hillside into orange light , the rivers , teeming with fish , can turn into streams of gold . As you settle down with just a fishing pole and a basket on the bank of River Orchy , near the Inverlochy Castle , any frustration will float away as gently as the circling water . It ' s just you and purple , pink , white flowers , seeking a perfect harmony . If you are a new comer to fishing , learning the basics from a fishing guide may leave you with a lifetime ' s fun . For many , fishing is more than a sport ; it is an art . Scotland offers interesting place where you can rest after a long day ' s fishing . Set against a wild mountain and hidden behind woodland , the beautiful Inverlochy Castle Hotel below the Nevis is a perfect place to see the beauty of Scotland ' s mountains . Ben Nevis is the highest of all British mountains , and reaching its 1343 - metre top is a challenge . But it ' s not just what goes up matters ; what comes down is unique . More than 900 metres high , on the mountain ' s north face , lies an all - important source of pure water . Its name comes from the Gaelic language \" usquebaugh \" or \" water of life \" ; and it is the single most important ingredient in Scotland ' s best known drink : whisky .", "questions": "The story of Queen Victoria is to show that", "options": {"model": ["the castle is a good place to go in scotland", "there is no better way to go fishing in scotland"], "human": ["tasting whisky is better than going fishing", "the Castle is a good place to go in Scotland"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
