{"id": "3003", "article": "We often hear people say , \" I have a good memory for things like that \" or \" I can remember names \" . But do you know memory is the single most important thing and it has played a very important part ? For early men , there were dangerous all around them - - bad weather , wild animals . The key to keep on living lay in man ' s ability to remember these dangers and the ways he had dealt with them in the past . In order for memories to be stored , the human brain became more complex . And as man learned how to deal with them , he became civilized . Surprisingly , scientists today understand little about memory and how it works . They have not yet found a way to open up the brain and observe its function without destroying it . Perhaps there are two types of memory : short - term and long - term . Short - term refers to those facts that stay with us for a few seconds to a few hours . For instance , when you stay at a hotel , you remember the room number and forget as soon as you leave . Long - term memory , on the other hand , means you remember things for a long period of time . If you spend your honeymoon in a particular hotel , it ' s likely that you ' ll remember your stay quite clearly . Scientists also believe that a short - term memory can become a long - term memory through consolidation . A lot of chemical and physical changes take place in the part of the brain . Although the human brain weighs three pounds , it contains 30 billion nerve cells acting like a computer . When those changes strengthen the links in certain nerve cells , a thought becomes part of the long - term memory .", "questions": "So far the great discovery scientists have made about the function of brain is", "options": {"model": ["chemical and physical changes", "physical changes"], "human": ["two types of memory", "chemical and physical changes"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
