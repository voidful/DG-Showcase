{"id": "5717", "article": "The first time I went abroad was when I went to London . It was in the summer holidays about five or six years ago and I went with three friends . The plane and train were quite expensive , so we decided to travel by coach . We left at five o ' clock in the morning and the journey to London took about sixteen hours but we did n ' t mind : we were all very excited because for all four of us it was our first time away from home . We stayed in London for three days , in a youth hotel not far from the centre . While we were there , we walked a lot . First , we went to see all the famous sites - - Big Ben , Piccadilly Circus , Buckingham Palace , then we went shopping in Oxford Street . On the last morning my friends stayed in bed late , but I got up early and went to Camden Market . You can buy all kinds of jewelry and clothes there , and I bought a silver ring for my sister . It was really hot in the afternoon , so we went to Hyde Park for a game of football . Unfortunately , I think the ring fell out of my pocket during the game , because I could n ' t find it when I got on the coach that evening ! I ' ve been back to London several times since then , but I do n ' t think I ' ll ever feel as excited as I did that first time .", "questions": "Why does the writer think he will never feel as excited as he did that first time ?", "options": {"model": ["because he went there for the first time .", "because he did n ' t want to go to london .", "because he could n ' t find the ring there ."], "human": ["Because he went there with his friends .", "Because he went to Hyde Park for a game of football with friends .", "Because he went there for the first time ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
