{"id": "5235", "article": "Most earthquakes occur within the upper 15 miles of the earth ' s surface . But earthquakes can and do occur at all depths to about 460 miles . Their number decreases as the depth increases . At about 460 miles one earthquake occurs only every few years . Near the surface earthquakes may run as high as 100 in a month , but the yearly average does not vary much . In comparison with the total number of earthquakes each year , the number of disastrous earthquakes is very small . [ JP ] The extent of the disaster in an earthquake depends on many factors . If you carefully build a toy house with an erect set , it will still stand no matter how much you shake the table . But if you build a toy house with a pack of cards , a slight shake of the table will make it fall . An earthquake in prefix = st1 / Agadir , Morocco , was not strong enough to be recorded on distant instruments , but it completely destroyed the city . Many stronger earthquakes have done comparatively little damage . If a building is well constructed and built on solid ground , it will resist an earthquake . Most deaths in earthquakes have been due to faulty building construction or poor building sites . A third and very serious factor is panic . When people rush out into narrow streets , more deaths will result . The United Nations has played an important part in reducing the damage done by earthquakes . It has sent a team of experts to all countries known to be affected by earthquakes . Working with local geologists and engineers , the experts have studied the nature of the ground and the type of most practical building code for the local area . If followed , these suggestions will make disastrous earthquakes almost a thing of the past . There is one type of earthquake disaster that little can be done about . This is the disaster caused by seismic sea waves , or tsunamis . ( These are often called tidal waves , but the name is incorrect . They have nothing to do with tides . ) In certain areas , earthquakes take place beneath the sea . These submarine earthquakes sometimes give rise to seismic sea waves . The waves are not noticeable out at sea because of their long wave length . But when they roll into harbors , they pile up into walls of water 6 to 60 feet high .
