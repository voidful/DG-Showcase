{"id": "5754", "article": "It is not easy for people to sail around the world in quite small boats . Sometimes the weather gets bad . Accidents can happen easily and quickly . One family once had an accident . A big fish swam under their boat and bit holes in it . Sea water came in and the boat soon went down . Luckily these people had another small boat - - - - a lifeboat , so they all got into the lifeboat . They lived in the boat for many days . They ate and slept , and always hoped . At last people in a ship saved them . How do people live in a very small lifeboat for a long time ? They must be strong in every way , they must have a hope , and they must have a strong desire to live . People can not drink seawater . If they drink a lot of sea water , they will quickly die . They must catch rainwater and drink it . They must also catch fish and birds for food . Lifeboats do not often carry cookers . So people can not cook their food in the lifeboats . Raw fish and birds are not very nice but they are their only food . They must eat raw food , or they will die .", "questions": "One family once had an accident at sea , because", "options": {"model": ["there was a small boat", "there was a small boat in their boat", "a fish bit holes in their boat"], "human": ["their boat met bad weather", "their boat hit a big rock and it was broken", "a fish bit holes in their boat"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
