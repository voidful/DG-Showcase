{"id": "547", "article": "Finding true happiness is a universal aspiration . We all want it , but can we all have it ? Genuine happiness is written all over our faces when we are truly contented , and , likewise , a forced smile does nothing to hide underlying sadness . Believing that everyone can create their own lasting joy , Matthieu Richard has been declared the Happiest Man in the World . Richard earned his \" happiest man \" status after a series of laboratory tests in 2004 . Richard has shared his thoughts on happiness with a worldwide audience . As an experienced speaker , he has explained his insights into happiness to everyone , from students to corporate groups . Looking inwards to find joy rather than relying on outer conditions , he believes , is the way to achieve well - being . \" It ' s quite clear that the outer conditions are not enough . The way we interpret those outer conditions in our inner experience is what determines either a sense of well - being or misery . We love to go jogging for fitness and we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful , yet we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most : the way our minds function . It ' s the essential thing that determines the quality of our experience . \" Besides this , Richard stresses that it is not what ' s happening around us that makes us unhappy , but rather the way we choose to react to it . The pursuit of happiness is becoming a modern obsession . As life becomes more complex , our ability to process our reactions to various outside influences comes under strain . \" Genuine happiness \" he says , \" does n ' t mean pleasant feelings one after the other . It ' s more like a series of qualities that we can develop as skills - - like openness , genuine love , compassion , inner strength and inner peace . \"", "questions": "Richard has been declared the Happiest Man in the World", "options": {"model": ["after he has been interviewed about the happiest man", "after a series of laboratory tests", "after he has been interviewed about the happiest man in the world", "after a series of lab tests in 2004"], "human": ["because he has shared his thoughts on happiness with a worldwide audience", "after he has explained his insights into happiness to everyone", "because he tries his best to achieve happiness and well - being", "after a series of laboratory tests"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
