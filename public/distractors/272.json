To achieve this goal , it is important for parents to introduce a variety of subjects in a positive and playful manner . \" Learning should not be forced , \" says Marion Godwin , who has taught first grade in Moorestown , N . J . for more than 30 years . \" It should be taught according to what they know and do best - - and that is ' play ' . When teaching them , play games and have fun with the subject . And parents should always be looking for ' teachable moments ' . \" \" You want a child to be a lifelong learner , so you want to show them learning is everywhere , \" she says . \" If parents take the time to lay a strong educational foundation , their children will keep building on it . \" Introduce children to science with hands - on activities that interest them , such as growing plants from seeds , discussing animals and how to care for pets , and observing the chemical changes that occur during cooking \" , she says . \" Sorting activities , simple patterns and counting games are a great way to teach children the basics of math , and taking them on field trips , singing songs and reciting rhymes also are ways to prepare them for the first day of school \" , she says . \" I think children are naturals when it comes to computers , \" she says . \" Let them play educational games on the computer and teach them how to type their first names using the keyboard . When they are more familiar with using the computer , let them find pictures of animals and places on the web . \" \" Do n ' t criticize the child , \" she says . \" You ca n ' t force them to learn something . If they do n ' t get something right , so what ? Smile and be happy and make the experience joyful . Parents need to understand that if a child gets something wrong , they may think something is wrong with them . Keep working with them and when they get the right answer make sure you tell them how hard they worked to get the correct answer . \"", "questions": "In Godwin ' s opinion , children should be encouraged to", "options": {"model": ["learn online under instructions", "play games with the subjects they do n ' t like"], "human": ["play more computer games", "learn online under instructions"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
