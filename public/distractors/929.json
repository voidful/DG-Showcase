{"id": "929", "article": "The British usually expect one or two snowfalls each year but the amount of snow rarely affects everyday life . However , this week Britain has had the worst snow it has seen in around 18 years . Some places had more than 30 cm in a day . The bad weather caused severe disruption . More than 3000 schools had to close as teachers and pupils were unable to get to school . School children were n ' t too unhappy about it though as they headed out to play the snow , building snowmen , having snowball fights , sledging and some even snowboarding and skiing . In London , bus services were withdrawn for a day and tubes and trains were cancelled . Major motorways in the country had to close . Many people were unable to get to work and it is thought the cost of this lost labor is around & 1 billion ( 10 billion yuan ) to businesses and the economy . Anyone who wanted to leave the country had problems too . Runways were closed at all the UK ' s major airports because of the amount of snow . Hundreds of flights were cancelled leaving some passengers stranded at airports . So why is the UK so ill - prepared for snow ? The mayor of London , Boris Johnson , explained that there are n ' t enough snow - ploughs and gritters and it does n ' t make sense to buy such equipment when it snows so infrequently . The south - east of England was the hardest hit at the beginning of the week but the snow is now moving northwards where the chaos continues . More ice and snow is forecast throughout the week and the advice from travel and weather organizations is to stay indoors unless you really need to _ !", "questions": "Which of the following would be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["heavy snow hits the uk", "the big weather causes the uk", "snow in the uk"], "human": ["Bad Weather Causes Chaos Just in London", "Heavy Snow Causes Disruption Only in Motorways", "Heavy Snow Hits the UK"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
