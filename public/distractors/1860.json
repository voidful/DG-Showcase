{"id": "1860", "article": "That was one surprising finding when researchers put Stanford University students in a simulated self - driving car to study how they reacted when their robo - chauffer needed help . The experiment was one in a growing number that assesses how cars can safely hand control back to a person when their self - driving software is at a loss . With some models already able to stay in their lane or keep a safe distance from other traffic , and automakers pushing for more automation , the car - to - driver handoff is a big open question . The elimination of distracted driving is a major selling point for the technology . But in the Stanford experiment , reading or watching a movie helped keep participants awake . The Stanford research suggests engaging people with media could help , while some automakers are marketing vehicles with limited self - driving features that will slow the car if they detect a person has stopped paving attention to the road . Though research is ongoing , it appears that people need at least 5 seconds to take over . Meanwhile , traditional automakers are advancing with the technology . Mercedes and Toyota sell cars that can hit the brakes and stay in their lane . By adding new features each year , they might produce a truly self - driving car in about a decade . One potential risk of this gradualist approach became clear this fall , when Tesla Motors had to explain that its \" auto pilot \" feature did not mean drivers could stop paying attention . Starting late next year , the Cadillac CTS will get a Super Cruise system , which will allow semi - autonomous highway driving . If the driver ' s eyes are off the road , and they do n ' t respond to repeated urging , the car slows . \" We are in no way selling this as a technology where the driver can check out , \" General Motors spokesman Dan Flores said , \" You can relax , glance away , but you still have to be aware because you know the technology ' s not safe . \" One riddle automakers must solve : How to get owners to trust the technology so they ' ll use it - - but not trust it so much that they ' ll fall into a false sense of security . Trust was on the mind of researchers who in August published an extensive report on self - driving cars . \" Although", "questions": "From the passage , we can conclude that", "options": {"model": ["the technology is a good way to solve the problem of self - driving in the future", "there are problems to solve in getting owners to trust the technology", "self - driving is a new way of driving", "self - driving technology has been used in driving cars"], "human": ["the automakers are proud of the new cars for their technology", "automakers have already marketed cars with limited self - driving technology", "traditional automakers rather than present ones are advancing with the technology", "there are problems to solve in getting owners to trust the technology"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
