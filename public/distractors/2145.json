{"id": "2145", "article": "You are from a middle - class family , and live in a normal - size home without any showy possessions , but you are surrounded by surprising consumption . This contrast is beginning to bother your 6 - year - old son . You are worried that he will want to live as they do , and wonder if you should move . Sometimes big pocket money , joyful birthday parties , special playrooms and super - big houses tell you that your neighbors probably have more money than you do , and that they ' re not as careful as you are with money , but you may find that they cook and dig in the garden with their children just as often as you do , talk with them as freely and read to them every night . Or you may find that some of these parents stay in one wing of their big house while their child plays by himself , way off in a wing of his own . In that unfortunate case , he is basically growing up alone without being looked after properly , but this can happen to a child who lives in a normal - size house , too , if he has a TV , a computer and a few video games in his room . Even the most caring parent does n ' t walk in and out of it to see what show her child is watching , what Internet site he has found and if he ' s still playing that video game . Too much uncontrolled screen time may lead to a certain loss of innocence , but mostly this child will lose the sense of unity and satisfaction , and if it does n ' t , you might decide to move . Do n ' t judge your neighborhood too harshly , though . There are some things that are right with almost any neighborhood and some things that are wrong with the best of them - - like those super - big houses . The wealth of their owners - - and the way they throw money around - - may make your son feel sorry for himself , unless you help him understand that you and his dad save some of the money , give some to people who do n ' t have enough and use the rest to pay for whatever the family needs . Children want - - should be provided with - - explanations when their parents do n ' t give them what they want .", "questions": "What is the problem with the worried parent in the text ?", "options": {"model": ["she does n ' t like her children any longer .", "she worries about the effect of her neighbors on her son .", "she does n ' t care about her children ' s bad habits ."], "human": ["Her house is n ' t as big as her rich neighbors '", "She can not provide her son with a special playroom .", "She worries about the effect of her neighbors on her son ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
