{"id": "730", "article": "A bargain is something offered at a low and advantageous price . A more recent definition is : a bargain is a dirty trick to force money out of the pockets of silly and innocent people . The cost of producing a new - for example - toothpaste would make 80p the proper price for it , so we will market it at PS1 . 20 . It is not a bad toothpaste , and as people like to try new things it will sell well to start with ; but the attraction of _ soon fades , so sales will fall . When that happens we will reduce the price to PS1 . 15 . And we will turn it into a bargain by printing 5p OFF all over it . Sometimes it is not 5p OFF but 1p OFF . What breathtaking rudeness to advertise 1p OFF your soap or washing powder or whatever ! Even the poorest old - age pensioner ought to regard this as an insult , but he does n ' t . A bargain must not be missed . People say one has to have washing powder ( or whatever ) and one might as well buy it a penny cheaper . The real danger starts when unnecessary things become ' bargains ' . Many people just can not resist bargains . Provided they think they are getting a bargain they will buy clothes they will never wear or furniture they have no space for . Once I heard of a man who bought an electric saw as a bargain and cut off two of his fingers the next day . But he had no regrets : the saw had been truly cheap . Quite a few people actually believe that they make money on such bargains . A lady once told me : \" I ' ve had a lucky day today . I bought a dress for PS120 , reduced from PS400 ; and I bought a beautiful Persian carpet for PS600 , reduced from PS900 . \" It will never occur to her that she has actually wasted PS720 . She feels as though she had made PS580 . She also feels , I am sure , that if she had more time for shopping , she could make a living out of it . Some people buy in large quantities because it is cheaper . Once a couple bought enough sugar for their lifetime and the lifetime", "questions": "Which statement will the author probably agree with ?", "options": {"model": ["it is not easy to make money in a bargain .", "it is not easy to make money on bargains .", "a bargain is a good idea to make money .", "bargains play tricks on people ."], "human": ["Bargains are things people do n ' t really need .", "Bargains are often real cheap products .", "Bargains help people make a living .", "Bargains play tricks on people ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
