{"id": "392", "article": "Our 16 - year - old daughter started to smoke last Christmas . It killed me to see that lovely girl with a cigarette in her mouth . I told her how I felt . Martha continued to smoke , saying , \" It ' s my life , \" and so on . I told her if she did n ' t stop smoking , I would n ' t send her to college . She agreed to give it up . Last night there was cigarette smell on Martha ' s breath . She had to say she had broken her word . Now I must do what I ' ve said to punish her . Martha is unusually bright and wants to teach children . I ' m working full - time to put her older sister through school and would do the same for Martha . My husband ' s pay is good , but with prices going up all the time we could never educate the girls unless I kept on working . My theory is that if smoking is more important to Martha than college , I ' m a fool to work to put her through college .", "questions": "The mother said that", "options": {"model": ["she was n ' t able to go to college with the girls", "though martha ' s father received high pay , it was not enough for their two girls ' college education", "the girl was n ' t allowed to smoke", "martha ' s husband did n ' t stop smoking because he did n ' t want to be a student"], "human": ["Martha was usually a stupid girl", "as everything was becoming more and more expensive , the two girls had to work hard to pay for their education", "she liked Martha ' s sister but hated Martha", "though Martha ' s father received high pay , it was not enough for their two girls ' college education"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
