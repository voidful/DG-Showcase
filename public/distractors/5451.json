They are a necessary part of life . Cars are used for business . They are driven to offices and factories by workers who have no other way to get to their jobs . When salesmen are sent to different parts of the city , they have to drive in order to carry their products . Farmers have to drive into the city in order to get supplies . Sometimes small children must be driven to school . In some cities school buses are used only when children live more than a mile away from the school . When the children are too young to walk too far , their mothers take turns driving them to school . One mother drives on Mondays taking her own children and the neighbors ' as well . Another mother drives on Tuesdays , another on Wednesday , and so on . This is called forming a car pool . Men also form car pools , with three or four men taking turns driving to the place where they all work . More car pools should be formed in order to put fewer cars on the road and use less gas . Too many cars are being driven . Something will have to be done about the use of cars .", "questions": "The United States is filled with cars , but", "options": {"model": ["the family has two or more cars", "not every family has a car", "many people have no car", "there are more cars in the united states"], "human": ["few families have two cars or even more", "every American has a car", "every family has a car", "not every family has a car"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
