{"id": "284", "article": "Many grown - ups worry that spending too much time playing video games is n ' t good for a kid ' s health . But some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there . They also seem to feel less pain when they are giving all their attention on a car race or other games . At a children ' s center in Baltimore , Maryland , young kids are finding hospital visits easier to deal with , thanks to a test program called HOPE . Patients in HOPE have a life - threatening condition where their kidneys no longer get rid of wastes from their blood . To get their blood cleaned , these kids must use the dialysis machines at the hospital three times a week , for at least three hours each time . HOPE allows kids to play Internet sports , racing , and other games with each other . They will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who have the same problem . \" We want to use the Internet to bring together kids who are ill , and let them know they are not alone , \" said Arun Mathews , the doctor of the program . He loved video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country . Many researchers elsewhere are testing video programs that might help young patients . For example , nine - year - old Ben Duskin of San Francisco , California , who was struggling with cancer helped to design a video game where players got rid of cancer cells . That ' s all great news , because doctors already know that reducing pain and worry helps patients heal faster .", "questions": "Which can be the best title for the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["playing video games is good for children ' s health", "doctors can video games help doctors help people", "video games may help reduce pain"], "human": ["Video Games Are Bad for Health", "HOPE Allows Kids to Play Online Games", "Video Games May Help Reduce Pain"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
