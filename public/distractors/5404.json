{"id": "5404", "article": "Dear Alice , I just received your letter . And I was very surprised to know that you decided to drop out of school and wanted to be a model . Being a model for a living is not easy . In fact , a famous person like me has a lot of problems that you could n ' t see . I ca n ' t eat what I like , even though I ' m very hungry . Keeping thin makes me look more beautiful on the stage because no one would like to see a heavy model . Besides , I have to wear a heavy coat in the hot sun , in a swimming suit in the cold air . And practicing walking nicely every day is tiring for me . You might say I made much money from modeling . But my dear niece , you have to know that money is nothing , knowledge is everything . School is important and everyone should go to school for a certain period of time . The longer they stay at school , the better they will be . Very often , I hope I can give up my job and continue my studies at school . But it is very difficult for me to go back to school again . I am too old to go back to school now . You are a pretty young girl with a bright future . You only have one year to finish your studies in high school . A year is really short . Please do consider my words carefully before you decide . Of course , there is only one thing I care about , and that is your happiness . Love , Emma", "questions": "Emma ca n ' t go back to school again , because", "options": {"model": ["she does n ' t like her old school", "she is so old that she has missed the best time in school", "she does n ' t like school life at all"], "human": ["she wants to make more money from modeling", "she has done a good job and makes a lot of money as a model", "she is so old that she has missed the best time in school"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
