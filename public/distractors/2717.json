{"id": "2717", "article": "It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach , CA . Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home . On a side street merging into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in . Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns . This made her more upset and nervous . On the right of this side street , the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped . A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car . She quickly did and as he waited , two more cars dashed in behind her car . While the woman he ' d helped waited for the signal to turn green , she sank into her driver ' s seat and was deeply relieved . Although this thoughtful man could n ' t see it , her body language expressed her gratitude . If you ' ve been in a traffic situation like the one she was in , you know how upsetting it can be . But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home . She told others about this , which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else . This kindness spreads . Someone does something nice for you and in turn you ' re likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else . A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect . It ' s like a stone that drops in a pond and causes ripples in each direction . No one knows how far those ripples will travel but they will affect everything they touch along the way .", "questions": "What can we know about most of the drivers on Pacific Coast Highway from the story ?", "options": {"model": ["they were not friendly or thoughtful .", "they were careless about traffic .", "they were n ' t kind to the driver ."], "human": ["They are thankful to the driver who helped the lady .", "They blasted their horns to encourage the lady driver .", "They were not friendly or thoughtful ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
