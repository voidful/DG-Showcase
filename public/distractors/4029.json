{"id": "4029", "article": "King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted \" kings do n ' t give up the throne , they die in their sleep . \" But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro - elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down . So does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days ? Does that mean the writing is on the wall for all European royals , with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyles ? The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy . When public opinion is particularly polarized , as it was following the end of the Franco regime , monarchs can rise above mere politics and symbolize a spirit of national unity . It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs continuing popularity as heads of state . And so , the Middle East excepted , Europe is the most monarch - filled region in the world , with 10 kingdoms ( not counting Vatican City and Andorra ) . Most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non - controversial but respected public figure . Even so , kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside . Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be , their very history and sometimes the way they behave today symbolizes outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities . At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth , it is strange that wealthy noble families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states . The most successful monarchies try their best to abandon or hide their old noble ways . Princes and princesses have day - jobs and ride bicycles , not horses ( or helicopters ) . Even so , these are wealthy families who party with the international 1 % , and media interference makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image .", "questions": "Which of the following is the best title of the text ?", "options": {"model": ["carlos , a lesson for all european monarchs", "king , a lesson for all european kings", "king spanish , a lesson for all european royals"], "human": ["Europe , the most monarch - filled region in the world", "Europe , symbolic heart of modern democracy .", "Carlos , a Lesson for All European Monarchs"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
