{"id": "5208", "article": "ChiChi weighs only 13 pounds . \" He ' s so tiny , I can carry him with one hand , \" says Mary Lane . \" Most people see him and think he ' s useless . \" But last October , ChiChi proved to be more than just a pretty face . Mary and her husband , Rick , were relaxing on the beach one afternoon while on vacation in North Carolina ' s Outer Banks . As usual , ChiChi was lying on his blanket in his own little beach chair . \" We had our noses buried in books , \" recalls Rick , \" when suddenly the dog became extremely uneasy . His bark was different from anything we had heard before . And he would not let us ignore him . \" ChiChi ran back and forth in front of his chair as if to run down the beach . The Lanes sat up to see two elderly women in the ocean , about 100 yards down the beach and 10 feet off shore . One was on her back , her head under the waves . The other was struggling hard to keep her friend ' s head above the surface . The Lanes rushed across the sand and into the surf . Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning , while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach . \" Then I went back to help Rick , \" Mary says . \" The sand dropped off steeply , and a riptide was beating the woman under . She was completely helpless . \" Not getting well from recent knee surgery , the woman had been unable to turn over or push herself up . \" Her friend had been in danger too , \" Mary says . \" The waves were pushing her around . There ' s no way she could have held on much longer . \" The women had n ' t called out for help . \" They were struggling so hard that there was no time for screaming , \" Mary recalls . \" But ChiChi had sensed their danger . \" Duty done , ChiChi was back in his chair , asleep , by the time the two women were on dry ground and the Lanes had returned to their blankets . Luckily , the women were fine , though shaken . They thanked the Lanes for saving their lives . Back home in Greensboro , North Carolina , the Lanes ordered a special collar with the words \" Hero Dog \" on it .", "questions": "Why could n ' t the woman get out of the water ?", "options": {"model": ["she could n ' t stand the danger .", "there was something wrong with her knee ."], "human": ["Her friend did n ' t offer help .", "There was something wrong with her knee ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
