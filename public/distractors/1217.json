No matter what I did and how hard I tried , in no way could I make my unruly hair to my satisfaction . Growing up in a Russian - Jewish home with parents who thought North American styling products were something illegal such as drugs , I was never allowed to put them in my hair . \" Why buy hair gel ? Your hair is so beautiful naturally . \" my mother would say . The teens at school did not agree . From boys ' not wanting to kiss me when we played spin the bottle in Grade 7 to being called the mop , I suffered from my hair .

If only I could find a way to manage the curls and put it behind bars , I told myself , I would feel secure and sexy . I tried everything : rollers , hairspray , gels and , at one point , an iron . Then , in my second year , a miracle happened . I was asked to be a hair model for Japanese hair straightening , a process by which the molecules of my curls would be broken and reset in a bone - straight position .
