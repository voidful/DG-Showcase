{"id": "391", "article": "Our 16 - year - old daughter started to smoke last Christmas . It killed me to see that lovely girl with a cigarette in her mouth . I told her how I felt . Martha continued to smoke , saying , \" It ' s my life , \" and so on . I told her if she did n ' t stop smoking , I would n ' t send her to college . She agreed to give it up . Last night there was cigarette smell on Martha ' s breath . She had to say she had broken her word . Now I must do what I ' ve said to punish her . Martha is unusually bright and wants to teach children . I ' m working full - time to put her older sister through school and would do the same for Martha . My husband ' s pay is good , but with prices going up all the time we could never educate the girls unless I kept on working . My theory is that if smoking is more important to Martha than college , I ' m a fool to work to put her through college .", "questions": "The mother warned that if Martha did n ' t give up smoking , she would", "options": {"model": ["refuse to pay for martha ' s college education", "throw out smoking at school", "n ' t get her college education", "stop smoking"], "human": ["refuse to give Martha any money", "not be Martha ' s mother", "not let Martha teach children", "refuse to pay for Martha ' s college education"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
