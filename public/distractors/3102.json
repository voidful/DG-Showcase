{"id": "3102", "article": "JK Rowling , the Harry Potter author , has signed a deal with Little , Brown and Company , to publish her first ever novel for adults , which is set to become one of the most anticipated book in years . The deal means that Rowling ' s long - standing relationship with Bloomsbury , the London - based publisher that launched the Harry Potter books , has come to an end , at least in terms of new works by the author . Rowling is keeping her fans guessing about the characters and plot of her new book . She only said that the new novel will be nothing like the Harry Potter series , which was sold over 30 million copies in the UK alone . She thought that with the move from children ' s to adult fiction , a switch to a new publisher seemed like a natural and reasonable step . She said , \" Although I ' ve enjoyed writing it every bit as much , this book will be very different from the Harry Potter series . The freedom to explore a new field is a gift that Harry ' s success has brought me . \" Ian Rankin , the Edinburgh - based author whose highly - successful detective novels are also set in the city , suggested Rowling ' s book will be a crime novel . \" Would n ' t it be funny if JK Rowling ' s first novel for adults turned out to be a crime story set in Edinburgh ? \" he said . Industry insiders guessed that the deal is worth more than PS5 million and the new book is expected to come out later this year . A spokesman said , \" JK Rowling ' s audience is vast and her position is unique . Harry Potter books were a global success and her fans are very loyal . Children that were eight , nine , or ten when the books first came out in the 1990s are now in their 20s . Plenty of adults , loved the books regardless of whether they had children , so the potential market for her is huge . \"", "questions": "What does the text mainly tell us ?", "options": {"model": ["jk rowling ' s first book for adults will be about a crime book .", "jk rowling will be a crime novel for adults .", "jk rowling ' s new book will be popular again this year .", "jk rowling ' s first book for adults will be published later this year ."], "human": ["JK Rowling has signed a deal with a new publisher .", "JK Rowling ' s new book will be more successful than her Harry Potter series .", "JK Rowling has to switch to a new publisher in order to publish her new book .", "JK Rowling ' s first book for adults will be published later this year ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
