{"id": "3972", "article": "When I was 4 , my parents decided they could no longer live together . That same year , my mom moved to Los Angeles ( L . A . ) and a therapist was hired to decide where I would live . Playing with a dollhouse in her office , I showed her the mother ' s room on one side and the father ' s room on the other . When she asked me about the little boy ' s room , I told her the little boy did n ' t know where to sleep . The therapist finally decided I would stay with my dad during the school years and visit my mom on long holidays and for summers . I began flying between two cities and leading two different lives . I remember my last school day in Grade Six . My friends made plans to go to the beach together , but I could n ' t join them because I had to fly to L . A . It was n ' t that I did n ' t want to see my mom and stepdad ; I just did n ' t want to leave my friends . It was n ' t easy to put up a wall , and pretend I did n ' t hate saying goodbye to them . In the morning , my dad drove me to school with my packed bags , and after school , my friends went together , and I went to the airport . What has come of this in the end is that I ' m always missing somebody . When I ' m in northern California , I miss my mom and stepdad , while in L . A . I miss going out with my friends , my dad , and my little brother and sister . But after so many flights , I ' ve learned that it ' s also fun traveling between two cities and experiencing different lives . Other children may not have the opportunity to experience so much .", "questions": "The dollhouse game showed that the boy", "options": {"model": ["had no feeling of belonging", "did n ' t want to see his mom and stepmother", "could n ' t live well with his parents"], "human": ["did n ' t want his parents to stay together", "did n ' t like his parents", "had no feeling of belonging"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
