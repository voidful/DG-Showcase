One day while my mother was out , I hit my finger with a hammer . The pain was terrible , but there was no one home to give me any sympathy . I walked around the house , finally arriving at the telephone ! Quickly , I called \" Information Please \" and told her what happened . She told me to open the icebox and hold a little piece of ice to my finger . After that , I called \" Information Please \" for everything . When my pet bird died , I told \" Information Please \" the sad story . She tried to comfort me , she said quietly , \" Paul , always remember that there are other worlds to sing in . \" Somehow I felt better . Another day I was on the telephone , \" How do you spell ' grateful ' ? \" . All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest . When I was 9 , we moved to Boston . A few years later , on my way to college , my plane put down in Seattle . I had about half an hour or so between planes . Without thinking , I dialed my hometown operator and said , \" Information , please . \" Surprisingly , I heard the small , clear voice I knew so well , \" Information . \" I had n ' t planned on this but I heard myself saying , \" Could you please tell me how to spell ' grateful ' ? \" There was a long pause . Then came the soft - spoken answer , \" I guess your finger must have healed by now . \" I laughed . \" So it ' s really still you , \" I said , \" I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time . \" I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and asked if I could call her again . \" Please do , \" she said , \" Just ask for Sally . \" Three months later I was back in Seattle . A different voice answered me . I was told that Sally passed away five weeks before . Before I could hang up she told me that Sally left a message for me - - \" Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in . He ' ll know what I mean . \" I thanked her and hung up . I knew what Sally meant .
