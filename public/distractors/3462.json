{"id": "3462", "article": "People like to look in the mirror often when they have a young and beautiful face . However , when one grows old , nobody wants to see their wrinkled old face in the mirror any more . So , many old people seldom look at their faces in the mirror . This is completely wrong . According to Wu Zhenyun , a professor from the Psychological Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences , a person ' s willingness to look in the mirror can reflect his or her mentality . When people do n ' t care too much about their age , they will try to carry themselves with ease and natural poise . They do n ' t mind looking in the mirror to see their own faces . Some people even love to look in the mirror from time to time to see whether they keep a good appearance . In this way , mirror becomes their best friend that help them to look confident . On the other hand , some people are afraid of being old . They do n ' t want to see the wrinkles on their face and their hair turning grey . So they do n ' t want to look in the mirror . This actually reflects a negative attitude they hold towards life . In the long term , they might suffer from psychological pressure or some sort of depression , which is actually not a wise act . \" Everyone can make themselves look charming at every age stage . If one is confident , one will always look beautiful , it shows that they accept themselves . \" professor Wu said . Mirror can not only give confidence to one . By looking in the mirror , one can even find the traces of some diseases from one ' s own face .", "questions": "The writer wrote this passage to", "options": {"model": ["analyze why people like and dislike to look in the mirror", "explain why people do n ' t care too much about their age", "remind people of the bad effects of mirror", "explain why people do n ' t like to look in the mirror"], "human": ["advise people to look in the mirror constantly", "reflect different attitude towards looking into a mirror", "introduce a way of finding signs of disease from one ' s face", "analyze why people like and dislike to look in the mirror"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
