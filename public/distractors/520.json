You feel upset if your phone is getting low on power , and you secretly worry things will go wrong at work if you ' re not there . All these can be called \" always on \" stress caused by smart phone addiction . For some people , smart phones have liberated them from the nine - to - five work . Flexible working has given them more autonomy in their working lives and enabled them to spend more time with their friends and families . For many others though , smart phones have become tyrants in their pockets , never allowing them to turn them off , relax and recharge their batteries . Pittsburgh - based developer Kevin Holesh was worried about how much he was ignoring his family and friends in favour of his iPhone . So he developed an app - - Moment - - to monitor his usage . The app enables users to see how much time they ' re spending on the device and set up warnings if the usage limits are breached . \" Moment ' s goal is to promote balance in your life , \" his website explains . \" Some time on your phone , some time off it enjoying your loving family and friends around you . \" Dr Christine Grant , an occupational psychologist at Coventry University , said , \" The effects of this ' always on ' culture are that your mind is never resting , and you ' re not giving your body time to recover , so you ' re always stressed . And the more tired and stressed we get , the more mistakes we make . Physical and mental health can suffer . \" And as the number of connected smart phones is increasing , so is the amount of data . This is leading to a sort of decision paralysis and is creating more stress in the workplace because people have to receive a broader range of data and communications which are often difficult to manage . \" It actually makes it more difficult to make decisions and many do less because they ' re controlled by it all and feel they can never escape the office , \" said Dr Christine Grant .", "questions": "Kevin Holesh developed Moment to", "options": {"model": ["help people control their use of mobile phones", "persuade people not to use smart phones", "promote the balance in life", "promote the balance of people ' s life"], "human": ["research how people use their mobile phones", "make people better use mobile phones", "increase the fun of using mobile phones", "help people control their use of mobile phones"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
