{"id": "3211", "article": "San Francisco has its cable cars . Seattle has its Space Needle . And , Longview has its squirrel bridge . The bridge , which has attracted international attention , is now a local landmark . The Nutty Narrows Bridge was built in 1963 by a local builder , Amos Peters , to give squirrels a way to cross the busy road without getting flattened by passing cars . The original bridge was built over Olympia Way on the west edge of the library grounds . Before the bridge was built , squirrels had to avoid traffic to and from the Park Plaza office building where office staff put out a nutty feast for the squirrels . Many times , Peters and others who worked in and near Park Plaza witnessed squirrels being run over . One day Peters found a dead squirrel with a nut still in its mouth , and that day ' s coffee break discussion turned into squirrel safety . The group of businessmen cooked up the squirrel bridge idea and formed a committee to ask the blessing of the City Council . The Council approved , and Councilwoman Bess LaRiviere named the bridge \" Nutty Narrows . \" After architects designed the bridge , Amos Peters and Bill Hutch started Construction , They built the 60 - foot bridge from aluminum and lengths of fire hose . It cost 1 , 000 . It did n ' t take long before reports of squirrels using the bridge started . Squirrels were even seen guiding their young and teaching them the ropes . The story was picked up by the media , and Nutty Narrows became know in newspapers all over the world . In 1983 , after 20 years of use , Peters took down the worn - out bridge . Repairs were made and crosspieces were replaced . The faded sign was repainted and in July 1983 , hundreds of animal lovers attended the completion ceremony of the new bridge . Peters died in 1984 , and a ten - foot wooden squirrel sculpture was placed near the bridge in memory of its builder and his devotion to the project .", "questions": "What happened over the coffee break discussion ?", "options": {"model": ["the squirrel bridge idea was born", "the squirrel bridge was built over olympic way .", "the squirrel bridge was built by a group of people", "the squirrel bridge was built"], "human": ["The committee got the Council ' s blessing .", "A councilwoman named the bridge", "A squirrel was found dead .", "The squirrel bridge idea was born"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
