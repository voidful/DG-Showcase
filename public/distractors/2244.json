{"id": "2244", "article": "When I came home to London at the end of my first term at university in December 1968 , I was flat broke , and more broke because it was Christmas , so I went to an employment agency for a job . \" Would you like to work for the Beatles ? \" they asked . \" Do n ' t you have anything better ? \" I asked . Fifteen minutes later I got the job . When I asked why they accepted me when millions would have done the job for free , the answer was \" That ' s just the problem . \" Yes . I owed the job to the fact that I was not a crazy fan . But of course I was a fan . It was difficult not to be . I worked over the winter holiday in 1968 and also during Easter 1969 . I had to take a taxi in the days to deliver papers sealed in envelopes to the Beatles ' house . I took the envelopes to the address , handed them over to whoever answered the door and lift . Who would entrust such papers to an unknown student today - the envelopes would be opened and the contents of the papers copied and sold to the Press . It never occurred to me to do that . Much has been lost in 40 years ! I am always asked how many autographs I collected , and the answer is none . How uncool would it have been to ask for an autograph ? Far better just to hear the Beatles ' s greets - - \" Hi , boy . \" How ' s it going ? \" More than 40 years later , this remains the best job I have ever had . It met my immediate material need and provides a memory that can be my life treasure . For a child of the 60s , this was its peak . If some details of the memory are not so fresh , it ' s because they were n ' t important then . At 19 , you take the things that happen for granted . At 61 , they become gold dust . If I had known that then , I would have kept a diary .", "questions": "The author was offered the job as a mail boy because", "options": {"model": ["the boy seemed not to be a fan of the beatles", "the boy did n ' t want to be a fan of the beatles"], "human": ["the poor boy could n ' t do heavy physical work", "the boy seemed not to be a fan of the Beatles"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
