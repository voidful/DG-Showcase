{"id": "3114", "article": "STARBUCKS China yesterday renamed a newlyopened outlet near one of Buddhism ' s most famous temples after a wave of controversy over what critics called a \" cultural invasion \" . The coffee shop in Hangzhou had opened as the Lingyin Temple Starbucks , leading some people to believe it was located inside the renowned temple . However , the company said in a statement yesterday that the coffee shop was actually in the Lingyin scenic area , about 20 minutes ' walk from the temple ' s entrance . It was said the outlet would now be known as the Lingyin Starbucks . Wang Shan , deputy director of the Lingyin office of the West Lake Administration in Hangzhou , capital of Zhejiang Province , said , \" Actually , the coffee house is a long distance from the temple . It is located in the tourist service area on Lingyin Road outside of the temple , as part of the supporting facilities . \" The temple ' s administration urged the cafe to change its name to make it clear that it was not located inside the temple . In a heated online debate , critics said the U . S . chain ' s commercial style would spoil the serenity that an oriental Buddhism temple should embrace . Supporters , however , said that the talk of an \" invasion \" was misplaced as the outlet was not inside the temple but on a nearby commercial street where a KFC restaurant and a shopping mall had been open for more than six months . The incident follows calls in 2009 to stop an earlier \" cultural invasion \" when the Seattlebased coffee chain had to move its outlet out of Beijing ' s Forbidden City seven years after it opened . Critics urged closure of the outlet , which they said was a \" humiliation \" for a culture exemplified by the ancient buildings .", "questions": "What ' s the best title of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["how to build the temple .", "how to build a temple in the city of beijing .", "the development of the \" culture \" in the us .", "coffee shop ' s new outlet deletes the word \" temple \" ."], "human": ["Cultural invasion .", "Starbucks chain invasion .", "Seattlebased coffee chain ' s invasion .", "Coffee shop ' s new outlet deletes the word \" temple \" ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
