He said that what made him happy was doing things for others , and that doing so gave him a nice feeling inside . However , no one really believed him , they thought he was silly . He spent all day helping others , dispensing charity to the poorest , and looking after abandoned animals . Very seldom did he ever do anything for himself . One day , he met a famous doctor who thought the boy ' s case was so peculiar that he decided to investigate him . So , with a complex system of cameras and tubes , the doctor managed to record what was happening inside the boy . What he discovered was surprising . Each time the boy did something good , a thousand tiny angels gathered around the boy ' s heart and started tickling it . That explained the boy ' s happiness , but the doctor continued studying until he discovered that we all have our own thousand angels inside us . Unfortunately , he found that , as we do so few good things , the angels spend most of their time wandering about , bored . And so it was that the secret to happiness was discovered . Thanks to that little boy we now know exactly what we have to do to feel our hearts being tickled .", "questions": "The famous doctor hopes to discover", "options": {"model": ["what it is that makes the boy so happy", "what the boy is that makes the boy happy", "what the boy is like", "what the boy ' s success is"], "human": ["what has gone wrong with the boy ' s heart", "whether the boy has a thousand angels inside", "why the boy never does anything for himself", "what it is that makes the boy so happy"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
