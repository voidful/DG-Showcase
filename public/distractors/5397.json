{"id": "5397", "article": "Take a look at the label on almost any bottle of milk and you may see the word PASTEURIZED . What does that mean ? Let ' s find out by meeting Louis Pasteur . Louis Pasteur was born in 1822 in a little town in France . As he grew up , he loved to paint . He loved to look at the world around him . When he went to college in Paris , he showed interest in looking through a microscope . A microscope makes things look a lot bigger ; it lets you see things you ca n ' t see just with your eyes . Looking through a microscope , Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water . He saw and drew pictures of the small living things - - he called them \" microbes \" or \" germs \" - - that crowded in a drop of water . One day a winemaker came into the lab , hoping that someone could help him with his problem . \" Sometimes my wine tastes delicious , but sometimes terrible , \" he said to Pasteur . \" Can you help me find out why ? \" Pasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope . He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs . If he killed these germs , maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible . He tried with different ways to kill the germs . In the end he found heating the wine seemed to work best . The winemaker tried it , and every bottle of wine tasted good . Pasteur ' s idea worked for other people , too . When farmers heated milk , it did n ' t turn bad so quickly . When breweries heated beer , it tasted better . People called it \" pasteurization \" - - - heating a liquid to kill bad germs . Are n ' t you glad that the milk you drink has been pasteurized ?", "questions": "What does the passage mainly tell us ?", "options": {"model": ["how pasteurization was invented .", "what kind of wine can be used to kill bad germs .", "how to keep wine from turning terrible ."], "human": ["What life Louis Pasteur lived .", "What to do with wine .", "How pasteurization was invented ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
