{"id": "164", "article": "Yesterday , I overheard our 9 - year - old son , Aaron , talking to his friend , Zach . \" Oh , God ! \" Zach began , peering in Aaron ' s closet . \" Where are all your toys ? \" \" Oh , we are doing something called ' Simplicity Plan ' , so I basically got rid of 80 % of my staff . \" \" What ? Did your mom and dad make you do this ? \" \" No . I decided to do it because I wanted to . When I give away a lot of my things , I have time for family activities . I did it because I wanted to live differently and have less staff in my life . \" \" But still , why would you choose to get rid of most of your toys ? \" \" Part of the reason is that my parents were doing it with their stuff . And my mom talked to me about it and explained how they felt happier afterwards . And I thought maybe I really had spent a lot of my time in my room playing with toys instead of spending time with my parents and sister . \" \" I feel proud because I am a person who has just what I need and not more . And I ' m starting new activities like writing how I feel , reading more , and spending more time doing housework around the house . \" \" Ok . Let me get this straight . You have fewer toys , more housework , and you feel happier ? \" \" Well , it ' s not that the housework is fun . But I do it with my parents . We talk and connect while we are doing it , so that is the fun . And we ' ve been doing more activities together , like reading aloud at night . And on weekends , we have conversations or go out together , instead of my dad being at his computer , my mom cleaning and me playing with my toys . \" \" Maybe you are right . \"", "questions": "Why did Aaron give away most of his toys ?", "options": {"model": ["because he wanted to spend more time with his families .", "because he did n ' t like the things he did ."], "human": ["Because he had no time to play with them .", "Because he wanted to spend more time with his families ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
