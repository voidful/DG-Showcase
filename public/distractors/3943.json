Most of us feel bad when we make mistakes , beat ourselves up about it , feel like failures , get mad at ourselves . And that ' s only natural . Most of us have been taught from a young age that mistakes are bad , and we should try to avoid mistakes . We ' ve been scolded when we make mistakes - - at home , school and work . Maybe not always , but probably enough times to make feeling bad about mistakes an unconscious reaction . Yet without mistakes , we could not learn or grow . If you think about it that way , mistakes should be cherished and celebrated for being one of the most amazing things in the world . They make learning possible ; they make growth and improvement possible . By trial and error - - trying things , making mistakes , and learning from those mistakes - - we have figured out how to make electric light , to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , to fly . Mistakes make walking possible for the smallest _ , make speech possible , and make works of genius possible . Think about how we learn : We do n ' t just consume information about something and instantly know it or know how to do it . You do n ' t just read about painting , or writing , or computer programming , or baking , or playing the piano , and know how to do them right away . Instead , you get information about something , from reading or from another person or from observing usually . . . then you construct a model in your mind . . . then you test it out by trying it in the real world . . . then you make mistakes . . . then you revise the model based on the results of your real world experimentation . . . and repeat , making mistakes , learning from those mistakes , until you ' ve pretty much learned how to do something . That ' s how we learn as babies and toddlers , and how we learn as adults . Mistakes are how we learn to do something new - - because if you succeed at something , it ' s probably something you already knew how to do . You have n ' t really grown much from that success - - at most it ' s the last step on", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that", "options": {"model": ["growing and improving are based on mistakes", "we should avoid making mistakes", "we should avoid making mistakes when we are not good"], "human": ["we learn to make mistakes by trial and error", "we read about something and know how to do it right away", "growing and improving are based on mistakes"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
