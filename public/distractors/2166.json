{"id": "2166", "article": "One - hundred - and seventh birthdays are n ' t usually celebrated for authors who are n ' t alive anymore . But Theodor Seuss Geisel - - - better known as the children ' s books author Dr . Seuss - - - who came into the world on 2 March , 1904 , was an unusual man . Like generations of children I was raised on his wonderful stories . But when I now read them to my children it ' s not just the childhood memories I enjoy . His writing is brilliant and imaginative and flows with a self - confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem . Readers ride his characteristic rhythm with an effortless joy that can not be matched by any other modern writer : You have brains in your head You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose And will you succeed ? Yes indeed , yes indeed ! Ninety - eight and three - quarters percent guaranteed . Seuss ' s brilliant cartoons and clever words make his books a delight for adults but they attract mostly children of course . His stories teach kids moral lessons but in indirect and entertaining ways . The first Seuss book I was given was The Lorax , written just as the 60s were becoming the 70s . Seuss was ahead of his time , and in this book the dawn of concern for environmental problems are shown as the Lorax \" who speaks for the trees \" battles against an evil businessman who wants to destroy the forest and make goods \" which everyone needs \" . It ' s not only a warning of the heavy price of environmental destruction , written well before most people had thought to worry , but it ' s also a smart analysis of consumer societies : \" Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot , nothing is going to get better . It ' s not . \" This is of course a moral message , but not of the kind designed to persuade the youngsters into behavior that adults want . I could go on , but hey , it ' s a birthday , and I ' m sure you folks have some good toasts to raise for the party . . .", "questions": "What ' s the purpose of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["to introduce dr . seuss ' s books to readers .", "to show how to make money by reading books .", "to celebrate dr . seuss ' s achievements .", "to encourage people to buy books for children ."], "human": ["To introduce Dr .
