{"id": "2335", "article": "A small boy sat on the street with a hat by his feet . He held up a sign which said : \" I am blind , please help \" . There were only a few coins in the hat . A man was walking by . He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat . He then took the sign , turned it around , and wrote some words . He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by would see the new words . Soon the hat began to fill up . A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy . That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were . The boy recognized his footsteps and asked : \" Were you the one who changed my sign this morning ? What did you write ? \" The man said : \" I only wrote the truth . I said what you said but in a different way . \" What he had written was : \" Today is a beautiful day but I can not see it . \" Do you think the first sign and the second sign were saying the same thing ? Of course both signs told people the boy was blind . But the first sign simply told people to help by putting some money in the hat . The second sign told people that they were able to enjoy the day , but the boy could not enjoy it because he was blind . The first sign simply said the boy was blind . The second sign told people they were so lucky that they were not blind . There are at least two lessons we can learn from this simple story . The first is : Be thankful for what you have . Someone else has less . Help where you can . The second is : Be creative . Think differently . There is always a better way !", "questions": "What was the boy doing on the street ?", "options": {"model": ["he was begging for money .", "he was helping the blind boy ."], "human": ["He was selling his old hat .", "He was begging for money ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
