{"id": "477", "article": "Your cell phone holds secrets about you . Besides the names and numbers that you ' ve programmed into it , traces of your DNA remain on it , according to a new study . DNA is genetic material that appears in every cell . Like your fingerprint , your DNA is unique to you - - - unless you have an identical twin . Scientists today usually analyze DNA in blood , saliva , or hair left behind at the scene of a crime . The results often help detectives identify criminals and their victims . Meghan J . McFadden , a biologist at McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , heard about a crime in which the suspect bled onto a cell phone and later dropped the device . This made her wonder whether traces of DNA remained on cell phones - - - even when no blood was involved . To find out , she and a colleague collectedflip - style phones from 10 volunteers . They collected invisible traces of the users from two parts of the phone : the outside , where the user holds it , and the speaker , which is placed at the user ' s ear . The scientists scrubbed ( meaning \" cleaned \" ) the phones using a liquid mixture made mostly of alcohol . The aim of washing was to remove all detectable traces of DNA . The owners got their phones back for another week . Then the researchers collected the phones and repeated collecting traces on each phone once more . They discovered DNA that belonged to the phone ' s owner on each of the phones . Surprisingly , DNA showed up even in swabs that were taken immediately after the phones were cleaned . That suggests that washing wo n ' t remove all traces of evidence from a criminal ' s cell phone . So cell phones can now be added to the list of clues that can help a crime - scene investigation .", "questions": "The scientists allowed the volunteers to keep their cell phones for a week in order to", "options": {"model": ["find out whether their phones were cleaned", "let them leave their traces on their phones"], "human": ["avoid keeping their cell phones too long", "let them leave their traces on their phones"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
