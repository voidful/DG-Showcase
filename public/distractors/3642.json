{"id": "3642", "article": "You can have your adventure and eat too at Europe ' s first green restaurant where traditional German food is served in a beautifully lit wooden hilltop restaurant powered by solar energy at a height of 1 , 025 metres among tall trees in the Black Forest . The Rappenecker Hutte is a 350 - year - old farm house in south Germany which has been serving as a hikers ' restaurant for several years . It was the starting point of the downhill course of the Mountain Bike World Championship ( MBWC ) in 1995 and is a well - known station of the Black Forest Ultra Bike Marathon ( BFUBM ) . \" People come here for adventure trips , mountain biking or hiking and stop for traditional German food . We produce all our energy from renewable sources as it is very expensive to get a power grid connection at this site , \" said Dirk Behringer , owner of the Rappenecker Hutte . Like the restaurant , the story of its present owner is equally amazing as Behringer , 57 , left his well - paid job in 2003 to stay here with his wife . \" I have traveled across the world and as I was growing old I realized I wanted to retire and live in nature . So I rented the restaurant . Since then I , along with my wife , live here in summer and we travel during winter , \" said the six - foot - tall man dressed in a T - shirt and shorts . Due to heavy snow during winter , the restaurant opens only for six months from April to September when it receives around 500 guests per week . The Behringer couple has employed no helper and does everything from cooking to cleaning at this hilltop restaurant which gives a picturesque view of the Black Forest . There are not many dishes on the menu for unexpected visitors . On a routine basis , there is one vegetarian dish which includes fried potatoes with dense milk cream , boiled vegetables and fresh salad . The non - vegetarian dish includes fried potatoes with pork and salad . There are also options to pick from fresh juices , hard drinks and coffee . All vegetables , fruits , dairy products and meat supplies to the restaurant come from farms in nearby villages .", "questions": "According to Dirk Behringer , his restaurant", "options": {"model": ["has a long history of over 50 years", "has an environment - friendly power supply"], "human": ["serves various kinds of German food", "has an environment - friendly power supply"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
