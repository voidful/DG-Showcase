However , I did n ' t make the team . It was a heavy blow to me . I cried all night . Kids today wo n ' t experience that kind of rejection . They ' re growing up in \" everybody gets a turn \" world where every child gets a chance to kick the ball , sing the song , and win the award . But that ' s not always such a good thing . Parents have become fearful of letting kids fail , thinking that our children are easily hurt and will never recover from anything - - that ' s a serious problem . Last week , my 7 - year - old daughter did n ' t get into the school play . At first , I was upset by it . How would she react ? When I gave her the news , I was ready to hug her and cry with her . She looked at me , made a slight face and said , \" That ' s too bad . What ' s for dinner ? \" It clearly was n ' t the end of her world . Maybe if we let our kids experience rejection once in a while , we ' d realize they are much stronger than we think . Kids need to be able to handle disappointments ; doing so helps them to prepare for real life . Most importantly , rejection carries the possibility not only for growth and can also motivate kids to try harder the next time . Rejection is pain . There is no way around that . How will our kids ever discover their true talents if we do n ' t let them ? Instead of complaining , maybe we should consider rejection an opportunity .", "questions": "The author shared her childhood story with readers to", "options": {"model": ["introduce the topic of how to let kids face rejection in life", "tell us how to accept kids ' feelings"], "human": ["explain why children are easily hurt in the process of their growth", "introduce the topic of how to let kids face rejection in life"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
