{"id": "2416", "article": "One of my main concerns when I am helping people achieve their goals is how they measure success . I see individuals getting frustrated as they struggle hard for success . One of the main reasons that cause this frustration is that people allow their definition of success to be determined by someone or something else . Another is that they become frustrated at their own apparent lack of success when comparing themselves to other people . We are individuals with individual wants , skills and experiences . We should look at our own skills to determine what is successful to us . We should look inwards to determine what it would mean for us to be successful in our own mind rather than someone else ' s . Evaluating a successful person needs to look at his pathway to success , his actions , his determination and translate that into his own experience to see how he can improve himself . You must set your own course of action , and stay on your course . You alone must determine what success means to you . Do what you do to the best of your ability and the rest will take care of itself . For example , I believe that I am successful but I am not a millionaire ! Others may not see me as successful in their eyes but that does not matter . It is how I see myself that is important to me and my life . Here is the truth . Being a success is doing your best , not being the best . Success is not something you become ; it is something you continue being . When we get to that point , we will experience a lot more joy and a lot less frustration . And that sounds good to us ! Remember the great quote from Napoleon Hill , \" If you can not do great things , do small things in a great way . \"", "questions": "What ' s the best title of this passage ?", "options": {"model": ["how to get successful", "how to be successful", "how to be a good success", "how to measure success"], "human": ["Frustration Determines Success", "The Importance of Frustration to Success", "Evaluations of a Successful Person", "How to Measure Success"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
