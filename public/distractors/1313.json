The Walt Disney Company has become the first major media company to ban ads for junk food on its TV channels , radio stations and websites . It hopes this will stop kids from making poor food choices . First Lady Michelle Obama called it a \" game changer \" that is sure to send a message to the rest of the children ' s entertainment industry . \" Just a few years ago , if you had told me or any other mom or dad in America that our kids would n ' t see a single ad for junk food while they watched their favorite cartoons on a major TV network , we would n ' t have believed you , \" said the First Lady , who heads a campaign to help stop child obesity . The ban would apply to Disney - owned ABC stations as well as Radio Disney and Disney - owned websites aimed at families with young children . In addition , Disney plans to make changes to its kids ' menus at theme parks and resorts . Fast - food options will be replaced with healthier choices , such as smoothies , apples , vegetables and yogurt . In addition to candy bars and fast - food meals , other foods that do n ' t meet Disney ' s nutritional standards will be banned from the company ' s kid - targeted media . Any cereal with 10 grams or more of sugar per serving will be _ . There will be no ads for full meals of more than 600 calories . Juices with high levels of sugar and foods with too much salt will also be pulled . Leslie Goodman , Disney ' s senior vice - president of Corporate Citizenship , said a company that wants to advertise will need to show that it offers a range of healthy options . Disney is n ' t the only one pushing away unhealthy foods .

He says large , sugary drinks are partly to blame for obesity .", "questions": "What will the Walt Disney Company do from 2015 ?", "options": {"model": ["stop broadcasting advertisements for junk food on tv .", "avoid eating junk food and fast food .", "avoid eating junk food and eating junk food .", "make some new advertisements for junk food on tv ."], "human": ["Produce more and better cartoons for young kids .", "Help kids develop healthy lifestyle in the program .", "Provide healthier food for kids while they are watching programs .", "Stop broadcasting advertisements for junk food on TV ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
