{"id": "1201", "article": "A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash across northern Europe . Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean , leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports . Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe . What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick . The hot volcano heats up the ice above it , which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano , keeping it stable . As the water flows out from under the glacier , the pressure lifts . The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface . This is exactly what is happening today . Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash . According to KLM , one of Europe ' s biggest airlines , airplanes can not go under the cloud or over it . Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane ' s engines , causing damage to the plane . The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland . The volcano left ash and sharp , glass - like rocks all over the countryside . Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash - covered grass or the sharp objects .", "questions": "What makes Grimsvotn different from other volcanoes ?", "options": {"model": ["it is a volcano .", "it is below ice ."], "human": ["It is the largest volcano .", "It is below ice ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
