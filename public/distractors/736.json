{"id": "736", "article": "It was my first day of high school , and I was late . My next class , Spanish , scared me . I just could not speak that language . As the bell rang , I ran to the classroom . At the door , a hand reached out and shook mine firmly . I looked up . A man with large glasses smiled . He introduced himself as Profe , which means teacher in Spanish . Right away , his warm smile and welcoming words eased my fears . That year , I enjoyed his classes a great deal because I learned more than just Spanish . I admit I only speak a little Spanish . But I try to live out the life lessons I learned from Profe . Every day Profe stood outside his classroom before and after class to give his \" hand hug \" . After school his room was always filled with students and he would talk to and chat with them - - even those not in his class . He taught me that every person is worth your time . One time , I was rejected by my friends , Profe told me , \" Linda , life gives you ashes . But learning its lessons will turn those ashes to jewels . \" Therefore , I learned to look at my troubles differently and not to fear any difficulty . In my senior year , I became president of one of the school ' s clubs , so I was very busy . Many times I did n ' t even have time to buy lunch . He served me by giving me his food as well as advice . He lived out what he taught us to do : serve others . The author William Arther Ward wrote : \" The mediocre teacher tells . The good teacher explains . The superior teacher demonstrates . The great teacher inspires . \" Thank you , Profe , for inspiring me .", "questions": "What can we learn from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the writer ' s teacher helped him with his school life .", "the writer benefited a lot from profe ' s class .", "the writer had a great influence on his students .", "the writer ' s teacher is a very successful teacher ."], "human": ["The writer was good at spanish in the end .", "Profe treated students differently according to their grades .", "Profe was not a superior teacher .", "The writer benefited a lot from Profe ' s class ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
