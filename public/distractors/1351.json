{"id": "1351", "article": "Researchers Look Behind the Tears to Study Crying Many people found themselves unusually moved by the historic presidential inauguration last week in Washington . Watching the huge crowds , we saw laughter , cheers , hugs - - - but also many tears . It made us wonder why do people cry ? Surely tears must be good for us - - away to calm the mind and cleanse the body . Yet studies show that crying sometimes makes people feel worse . Three researchers in Florida and the Netherlands recently looked more deeply into the subject . They examined detailed descriptions of crying experiences . Psychologist Jonathan Rottenberg at the University of South Florida says they wanted to study crying as it happens in everyday life , not in a laboratory . The team analyzed information from the International Study on Adult Crying . As part of that study , three thousand people in different countries , mostly college students , wrote about recent crying experiences .

People who reached out for emotional support at the time - - - and received it - - - reported better results from the crying experience . But Professor Rottenberg says those who felt shame or embarrassment while crying were less likely to report that crying had been helpful . Research has shown that women cry more often and more intensely than men . But it may not have better effect , says the psychologist . The new findings , he says , did not show that a person ' s sex was an advantage of beneficial crying . In other words , just because women cry more does not mean they are more likely to have a \" good \" cry . The paper entitled \" Is Crying Beneficial ? \" appeared in December in Current Directions in Psychological Science and there is more to learn .
