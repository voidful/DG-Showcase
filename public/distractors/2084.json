{"id": "2084", "article": "As a kid , I was always chubby . In college I started _ . It got out of control when I went to law school . I ' d made a decision a thousand times : I ' m going to lose weight now . But what motivated me to get serious about it was turning 30 . I weighed 414 pounds . I was always tired . Some of my family members have suffered from heart disease , and I was scared . I also wanted to look better . So after my birthday , I walked into the office of a weightloss doctor . She was very understanding . Her focus was on balanced meals and she wanted me to exercise . Walking was all I could do at first . I started by walking a few blocks and gradually increased the distance , until one weekend , I found myself saying , \" Wow , this seems pretty easy . \" So I started to run . I was losing nine or ten pounds a month , and I had more energy . I started to think about the New York City Marathon . For years , I watched the runners and thought , \" This looks like fun , but I could never do that . \" But now I realized that maybe I could . I joined the New York Road Runners . I ran a 10km , then a halfmarathon . I still was n ' t confident I could run a full 26 miles . But I told myself I was going to do it , no matter what . By my 33rd birthday , I was down to 180 pounds . I started formally training for the marathon . And on the morning of November 1 , I stood on the Verrazano Bridge in Staten Island with more than 40 , 000 other runners , waiting for the event to start . It was unbelievable to have the audience cheering me on , handing me cups of water . And I crossed the finish line . My friends sprayed ( . . . . . . ) me with beer , as if I ' d won the Super Bowl . And at that moment , I knew : If I set my mind to something , nothing is impossible .", "questions": "What do we know from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the author was n ' t confident when running the marathon .", "the author did n ' t like running in the new york city marathon .", "the marathon the author ran started on the verrazano bridge ."], "human": ["The author formally trained for the marathon for three years .", "The author started by running when losing weight .", "The marathon the author ran started on the Verrazano Bridge ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
