{"id": "1120", "article": "The more we learn about the octopus , the more intelligent we discover they are . Octopuses possess not one but nine \" brains \" , one in each of their legs and a central brain behind the eyes . Octopuses can solve problems , can be trained to learn behavior and are extremely good at figuring out how to get out of an aquarium and get into food . We can learn a lot from an octopus . An octopus does n ' t have a backbone , which does n ' t mean that they lack nerve . On the contrary , their nervous system , which goes all the way down each leg , is very complex . They are able to take in a lot of information about their world and seem to be able to remember , learn and adapt to new situations . The suckers on their long legs can not only feel , but also taste . Each sucker works individually , so an octopus can just focus on one leg or one sucker . Their eyesight is sharp . Although their brains are quite small in comparison to ours , they still have very large brains for invertebrates . They have many physical characteristics of a human brain . Perhaps you ' ve seen the video of an octopus in a German aquarium that learned to open a jar to get its food . Octopuses have also been taught to go through mazes and to pick out different shapes of patterns . Their short term and long term memory seems to be excellent . It is thought that octopuses are as intelligent as dogs in their capacity to learn certain behavior , solve problems , and make use of objects . In the movie \" Octopus Intelligence : Deep Sea Aliens , \" some species of octopuses are letting young octopuses watch the adults in order to train them . If this keeps up , in a hundred thousand generations the octopus may rule the seas . Clearly , there is more to an octopus than just a lot of legs .", "questions": "We can learn from the passage that the octopus", "options": {"model": ["has a very complex nervous system", "knows how to use the body of the octopus", "has a large brain behind the eyes"], "human": ["has nine small brains and a big one", "has all its brains behind its eyes", "has a very complex nervous system"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
