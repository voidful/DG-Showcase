{"id": "4681", "article": "Prana was a beautiful dog , whose name means \" breath of life \" . Although he died several years ago , I can still remember the days we spent together and what he has taught me about love . I have two apple trees in the garden . Prana loved apples . When he went outside , he ' d catch an apple and take it into the house to eat later . The apples had been on the ground and were often dirty so I was n ' t always happy that Prana had brought them into the house . It was an autumn day in America , but it was very cold . A big snow fell and we had not done anything for its coming . On that special day , Prana went outside and I watched him through the window . I noticed that he was madly digging holes and bringing the apples to the ground so they could be seen above the snow . I did not know why he was doing this . He seemed to want to do something special . When I called him back , he had his usual one apple in his mouth . About five minutes later , I looked outside . The garden was completely covered with birds . Prana had dug up all those apples for his bird friends to eat . He knew that they would n ' t have stored enough food for the coming winter !", "questions": "On the snowy day , Prana", "options": {"model": ["brought the apples to the ground and took them into the house", "brought the apples under the snow to the ground", "brought the apples into the house"], "human": ["ate up all the apples", "dug holes to put the apples in them", "brought the apples under the snow to the ground"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
