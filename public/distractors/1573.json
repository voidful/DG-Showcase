{"id": "1573", "article": "In early autumn I applied for admission to college . I wanted to go nowhere but to Cornell University , but my mother fought strongly against it . When she saw me studying a photograph of my father on the sports ground of Cornell , she tore it up . \" You ca n ' t say it ' s not a great university , just because Papa went there . \" \" That ' s not it at all . And it is a top university . \" She was still holding the pieces in her hand . \" But we ca n ' t afford to send you to college . \" \" I would n ' t dream of asking you for money . Do you want me to get a job to help support you and Papa ? Things are n ' t that bad , are they ? \" \" No , \" she said . \" I do n ' t expect you to help support us . \" Father borrowed money form his rich cousins to start a small jewellery shop , His chief customers were his old college friends . To get new customers , my mother had to help . She picked up a long - forgotten membership in the local league of women , so that she could get to know more people . Whether those people would turn into customers was another question . I knew that my Parents had to wait for quite a long time before their small investment could show returns . What ' s more , they had not wanted enough to be rich and successful ; Otherwise they could not possibly have managed their lives so badly . I was torn between the desire to help them and change their lives , and the determination not to repeat their mistakes . I had a strong belief in my power to go what I wanted . After months of hard study I won a full college scholarship . My father could hardly contain his pride in me , and my mother eventually gave in before my success .", "questions": "The author was not allowed to go to Cornell University mainly because", "options": {"model": ["his parents did not have enough money for him", "his mother did n ' t support him", "he did n ' t want to be rich", "his mother did n ' t want to be a college student"], "human": ["his father graduated from the university", "his mother did not thinks it a great university", "his parents needed him to help support the family", "his parents did not have enough money for him"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
