He has become the owner of a florist company whose sales are well over $ 100 000 a year . One day when Roger was only twelve , he stopped at a local flower shop . He asked the owner if he could work for him , without pay , in order to learn the business . Roger started working every day after school and on weekends . After two years on the job , he finally asked for a small salary . The owners told him he \" was n ' t good enough to be paid . \" So he quit , and found a paying job at another local flower shop . He worked hard there , but after six months they _ because business was slow . Not discouraged , Roger decided to do it alone and started his own flower store in a basement in his town . He started his business with only sixty - five dollars . He bought old refrigerators at garage sales and knocked the shelves out . This turned them into coolers for his fresh - cut flowers . His business grew rapidly as he built up a reputation for top quality and fine service . In 1977 , Roger bought out the flower store where he had worked without pay for over two years . The people who said he \" was n ' t good enough to be paid \" were astonished to find that they were being taken over by a teenager . He had plans to renovate the whole store . One of the reasons the owners sold out to Roger was that the store was n ' t doing well . But after Roger took over ownership and redid the store , business started booming . In fact , business was so good that after one year , he celebrated by buying out the other store where he had worked . Roger then combined both stores and moved to a location in the center of his town . The new store has 2 000 square feet and seven employees . And he did it all before he reached the age of twenty .", "questions": "The author is wants to show us that people who want to succeed in business should", "options": {"model": ["work hard and have no job", "work hard and get up without pay", "work hard and never give up", "start his business with the help of his owner"], "human": ["work without pay", "own a flower shop", "work as teenagers", "work hard and never give up"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
