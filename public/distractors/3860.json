{"id": "3860", "article": "Sales of crime novel The Cuckoo ' s Calling have rocketed since its author Robert Galbraith was unmasked as JK Rowling , according to The Bookseller . It said 17 , 662 hardback copies were sold between 14 and 20 July , up from just 43 copies the previous week , according to Nielsen BookScan data . The Cuckoo ' s Calling was the week ' s bestselling hardback novel , despite some booksellers running out of stock . The Harry Potter author was identified in a newspaper article last week . On a website Rowling said 8 , 500 English language copies had been sold in all forms , including e - books , before her unmasking . The author added that she had received two offers from television production companies . \" The situation was becoming increasingly complicated , largely because Robert was doing rather better than we had expected him to , \" she said . \" But we all still hoped to keep the secret a little longer . Robert ' s success during his first three months as a published writer ( discounting sales made after I was found out ) actually compares favourably with JK Rowling ' s success over the similar period of her career . \" However , the Bookseller reported the hardback had sold fewer than 500 copies in its three - month period on sale before the Sunday Times ' expose . The recent sales were not enough to send The Cuckoo ' s Calling to the top spot in the official UK top 50 , instead landing it in third place . The Rowling revelation coincided with the paperback release of The Casual Vacancy - - her first official post - Potter work - - which sold 19 , 548 copies in the same week , making the book number two in the sales chart . Neither title managed to draw John Grisham ' s The Racketeer from the top of the chart , which shifted 24 , 222 copies - - a 19 % drop on the previous week . Elsewhere on the Robert Galbraith website , Rowling has revealed the reason she chose her pen name . She said she picked Robert because US senator Robert F Kennedy was her \" hero \" and she had never used the name in one of her earlier books . \" I can only hope all the real Robert Galbraiths out there will", "questions": "What does the passage mainly talk about ?", "options": {"model": ["the reason why robert ' s success attracted the readers .", "unmasked author brings about a new rise .", "unmasked author makes a living by selling her books ."], "human": ["New challenges are coming for Rowling ' s career .", "Rowling ' s Creativity leads to another legend .", "Unmasked author brings about a new rise ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
