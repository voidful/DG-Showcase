{"id": "261", "article": "Dear David , My daughter will be five years old . She is happy , well - mannered , loving and pretty . She has attended a Montessori school since she was 16 months old and has made two friends . The three girls are always together , or talking with each other . But recently the girls told my daughter that they would not play with her if she kept playing with the boy who was disliked by most of the class . My daughter always finds good things in others and insisted they play with him , too . Then one of the friends told my daughter she did n ' t have straight hair and should n ' t play with them . Then she started ignoring my daughter . My mother - in - law decided to iron my girl ' s beautiful curly hair . With her birthday coming , my child decided to invite her friends to her party . When I asked her why , she said because they were always together , but I know one of the girls will not attend her party . I ' m concerned about her . I feel lost , not knowing how to help my child . Jenny Dear Jenny , It ' s always painful to a mother when someone hurts her child . Your daughter ' s friends were n ' t nice to her , but little kids are still learning how to get along with others . As a result , young friendships are often fleeting , even changing from day to day . Your daughter seems to be remarkably loving , outgoing and mature beyond her years . Perhaps you need to be proud of the way she treats people . Ironing your daughter ' s hair wo n ' t send your daughter or the other girls a good message . It implies that there is something wrong with the way she is . You have no choice but to let your daughter know that one of the girls wo n ' t be attending her birthday party . If she seems upset , remind her that other friends will be there . My guess is that she will rise to the occasion . Hope this helps .
