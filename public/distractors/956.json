The American academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommends that kids should spend no more than 2 hours each day on screen time , including watching TV or movies , or playing computer or video games . So consider setting limits at least that strict to keep game playing from affecting their schoolwork , household responsibilities , and the physical activity your son needs very day . Make sure that he ' s playing games which are suitable for his age group . All video games are rated and labeled by the Entertainment Software Rating Board . Steer clear of any rated \" M \" for mature . Those are for ages 17 and older and can contain heavy - duty violence , strong language , and sexual content .
