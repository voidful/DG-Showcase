{"id": "5198", "article": "On the first day of the sixth grade , I waited at the bus stop for the school bus . When it arrived , I got on and I noticed one little girl called Amy . She was different from everyone else on the bus . \" Do n ' t talk to Amy , \" warned Lauren , who sat beside me . \" Or everybody will make fun of you . \" Amy had many physical differences and the other kids always made fun of her . Her eyes were n ' t straight . Her glasses were an inch thick . And she had really strange teeth . Every day kids shouted insults at Amy . They would say , \" God , what a strange face ! Stop looking at me ! \" For a while I shouted insults at Amy too , just so I could fit in . After all , I did n ' t want the other kids treating me the same as they treated Amy . But it made me sad to insult her . I could see that the insults were making her feel ashamed and lonely . I began to pity her . Then I wanted to stand up for her . I did n ' t know how to stop my schoolmates insulting Amy until the night of our class skating party . Our whole class was there , including Amy . Amy did n ' t know how to skate , but I could see how much she wanted to have fun like the rest of us . So I skated over to her and took her by the hand . Holding her hand , I slowly pulled her , and together we began the journey around the skating rink . I did n ' t say a word to her , and she did n ' t speak to me . She just smiled , and every once in a while she would laugh in excitement . The next morning , on the school bus the other kids talked a lot about Amy and me . But nobody insulted her or me . And they did n ' t do that for the rest of the year . When the school year ended , my family moved away , and I never heard of Amy again . But I ' ve always hoped that I changed her life for the better . She changed my life as well . After becoming her friend , I no longer tried to impress people by trying to act like them or dress like them . I became myself .", "questions": "Why did the writer change his attitude towards Amy ?", "options": {"model": ["because he was moved by the girl ' s rudeness .", "because amy helped him a lot ."], "human": ["Because he was afraid that he would n ' t fit in .", "Because Amy helped him a lot ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
