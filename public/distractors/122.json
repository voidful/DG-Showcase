They had just put on clean clothes , so I was a little worried about the mud on the playground . It was not long before Kathy got her beautiful skirt dirty on the playground . She dug through the rocks . I was about to blame her for getting her clothes dirty when she ran towards me with a smile on her face . When she got to me , she handed me a little heart - shaped rock and said , \" Here , Mom ! Here is a heart for you - - just because I love you ! Keep it ! \" With tears in my eyes , I thanked her .

It makes me think of the days when my grandfather told me , \" You would not enter the kingdom of happiness until you pretended to be a small child . \"", "questions": "At first , the author wanted to blame Kathy because she", "options": {"model": ["got her clothes clean on the playground", "got her clothes dirty", "got her clothes clean"], "human": ["ran on the playground", "gave her a muddy rock", "got her clothes dirty"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
