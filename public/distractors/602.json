{"id": "602", "article": "Your House Will Take Care of You In Old Age Have you ever thought what your life would be like in old age ? Everyone talks about the \" aging \" society with large numbers of elderly people needing home care . Now German researchers have set up a \" smart \" house , programmed to help the elderly live at home with dignity . Scientists at Germany ' s Fraunhofer Institute say the house combines existing technology with future - oriented technology . For example , the \" smart \" bathroom has a touch screen mirror that can remind people to take their medicine , wash their hands or brush their teeth . The hardware behind Fraunhofer ' s electronic bathroom is not new , and the software runs on a regular personal computer . When the medicine cabinet is opened , a display in the middle of the mirror tells the person how many pills to take . The mirror is linked to a care provider , who can remotely check whether a patient at home is actually taking medicine and brushing his or her teeth . As many elderly people have arthritic conditions that make it difficult to operate water taps , the mirror also has displays that turn the water tap on or off or control the water temperature . The bathroom is only the start . Kitchens , bedrooms and all other parts of the intelligent \" home will become \" user - friendly \" to meet all kinds of individual needs . Sensors in doors , toilets , taps , light switches and carpets detect every activity and record them electronically . Doctors or care staff can see from the computer records what personal hygiene tasks have been completed , how often the elderly person visits the bathroom or uses the toilet . In case of an emergency , the computer automatically alerts the chosen contact person or calls the care center .", "questions": "The author of the text mainly", "options": {"model": ["explains a new house", "introduces a new house"], "human": ["calls on people to care for the old", "introduces a new house"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
