{"id": "865", "article": "It was a Friday . As usual , the office became busier and busier . Orders to buy and sell came and went like birds . It was in the stock market , the world of money that Mr . Robert , the stockbroker , worked faster and faster . There was no room in it for the world of human feelings or the world of nature . Near lunchtime , everything quieted down . Mr . Robert stood by his desk with his hands full of letters . Suddenly through the open window came a smell of flowers , like the thin breath of spring . Mr . Robert stood still . This was Miss Angelia ' s smell , her own and only hers . The world of the stock market disappeared . And Miss Angelia was in the next room - - only twenty steps away . \" I ' ll do it now , \" said Mr . Robert softly . \" I ' ll ask her now . Why did n ' t I do it long ago ? \" He ran into her office . She looked up at him with a smile . Her face turned a soft pink . \" Miss Angelia , \" he said , hurriedly , \" I only have a moment to talk . I want to say something important to you , Will you be my wife ? I have n ' t had time to show you , but I really do love you . \" \" Why . . . what are you talking about ? \" cried the young lady . She stood up and looked at him strangely . \" Do n ' t you understand ? \" Mr . Robert asked quickly . \" I want you to marry me now . \" Miss Angelia acted very strangely . At first she seemed surprised . Then she began to cry . But then she smiled through her tears like the sun through rain . She put her arms around his neck . \" But do n ' t you remember , darling ? \" she said . \" We were married yesterday evening at 8 : 00 , in the little church around the corner . \"", "questions": "What can be inferred from the end of the story ?", "options": {"model": ["miss angelia felt happy in her heart .", "miss angelia was in the stock market at last .", "miss angelia was kind .", "miss angelia did n ' t like birds ."], "human": ["Mr .
