The piece of technology in question would be smart , able to tell you about the weather and where the nearest restaurants are . The good thing is you no longer need to wonder , because something like this already exists . And its name is Siri . Siri is a voice recognition application designed for Apple products and the concept has been around for almost a year . When Siri first came out it could only speak English , but now it has \" learned \" lots of new languages , including Chinese , Cantonese and Taiwanese , reported The Wall Street Journal . So , you can give it orders in your mother tongue . But how could a cell phone or a computer \" hear \" what you are saying and understand it ? This is all because of voice recognition technology . When you speak , your voice creates vibrations in the air - a bit like waves in the water when you throw a rock into the lake . The microphone receives the vibrations and the computer changes them into digital data that is then divided into many parts . They are analyzed one by one to see what pronunciations each part stands for . The computer then puts these pronunciations together into possible words according to its built - in dictionary . But figuring out the words is far from enough ; building words into meaningful sentences is the most difficult part . The computer has to compare what it hears to a large library of known phrases and sentences to determine what the user is saying . However , people do n ' t always talk in the most standard way and sometimes make grammatical mistakes . This is why traditional voice recognition software always requires you to remember keywords and to speak in a certain way . Fortunately , Siri is n ' t like that . It ' s not just \" voice recognition \" ; it ' s \" natural language understanding ( NLU ) \" . You can ask it things like \" Do I need an umbrella today ? \" and it will know that you are asking about the weather , according to ABC News . \" The key thing is NLU - understanding what you mean and what you want , \" Neil Grant from Nuan", "questions": "Which step is the most complicated in the process of voice recognition according to the article ?", "options": {"model": ["listening to the words in the first paragraph .", "listening to all the words in a passage .", "providing different meanings from each part .", "figuring out meaningful sentences based on the words ."], "human": ["Changing the received vibrations into digital data .", "Analyzing the digital data to see what pronunciations it represents .", "Putting the pronunciations together into possible words .", "Figuring out meaningful sentences based on the words ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
