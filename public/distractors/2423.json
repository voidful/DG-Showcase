{"id": "2423", "article": "What do astronauts eat in space , and why ? How did astronaut food come into being ? How do astronauts preserve food for long periods of time in space ? NASA ( the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) has been researching food for space travel since the 1960 ' s to find the best way of keeping astronauts from going hungry . The research could date from an accident that took place on the first manned Gemini mission in 1965 . astronaut John Young managed to sneak a corned beef sandwich onto the Geminni III capsule to eat during its orbit around Earth . To Young ' s surprise , the sandwich plan did not go as expected ; instead the sandwich began to break apart and scatter through the Geminni IIIcapsule . This could have resulted in disaster , since a small piece of food could have stuck in the air vents and other equipment . The sandwich was stuffed into a pocket to avoid the further mess inside the small space capsule This incident caused NASA to enforce strict rules on what types of food can be taken into space . Space food has come a long way since then . During the Gemini period , the astronauts mostly ate cubed , compressed foods high in calories and lightweight . NASA expects a long shelf life for space food . The majority of food taken into space has been dried out or heat - treated . These process and use of sodium , make the food taken into space last longer . Research is ongoing into space food to seek out healthier ways to preserve it . Too much sodium is unhealthy , and can badly change the taste of some foods .", "questions": "The majority of the space food is dried out or heat - treated in order to", "options": {"model": ["keep it long enough", "make it last longer"], "human": ["keep astronauts healthy", "make it last longer"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
