{"id": "2143", "article": "\" Congratulations , Mr . Jones , it ' s a girl . \" Fatherhood is going to have a different meaning and bring forth a different answer from every man who hears these words . Some feel proud when they receive the news , while others worry , wondering whether they will be good fathers . Although there are some men who like children and may have had considerable experience with them , others do not particularly care for children and spend little time with them . Many fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children for some time . For other couples , pregnancy was an accident that both husband and wife have accepted willingly or unwillingly . Whatever the reaction to the birth of a child , it is obvious that the change from the role of husband to that of father is a difficult task . Yet , unfortunately , few attempts have been made to educate fathers in this re - socialization process . Although many good books have been written about American mothers , only recently have some books discussed the role of a father . It is argued by some writers that the transition to the father ' s role , although difficult , is not nearly as great as the transition the wife must make to the mother ' s role . The mother ' s role seems to require a complete transformation of daily routine and adaptation to a new life , on the other hand , the father ' s role is less demanding and immediate . However , even though we have mentioned the fact that growing numbers of women are working outside the home , the father is still thought by many as the breadwinner in the household .", "questions": "It is stated in the passage that", "options": {"model": ["some parents are not prepared to have a child", "some fathers and mothers do not care for children", "most fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children for some time", "most fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children"], "human": ["young couples do not like children at all", "working couples do not have much time to take care of their children", "many parents look forward to having a boy as their first child", "some parents are not prepared to have a child"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
