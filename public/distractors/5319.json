{"id": "5319", "article": "More than half of rich Americans have not shown their full wealth to their children , a new survey showed last Tuesday . The survey , published by the Bank of America , studied the rich with $ 3 million or more in possessions . It found that \" surprisingly few of those surveyed have well - developed plans to preserve and pass on their possessions to their children \" . The majority of the 457 people surveyed are self - made , first - generation rich . Fifty - two percent of parents have not chosen not to tell their children just how wealthy they are , and 15 percent have given away nothing about the family wealth . One in three parents said they had never thought to do it . They are worried that their children would become lazy , spend money freely , make bad decisions and even become a target for attractive women who use their looks to get money from rich men . Only 34 percent strongly agreed that their children would be able to handle any inheritance they plan to leave them . \" There is an expectation about the wealthy parents that _ have a responsibility to pass down their fortune to the next generation , \" said Sallie Krawcheck , president of the Global Wealth and Investment Management of the Bank of America . \" Our research , however , uncovered changing views of what one generation owes the next . \" The trend is led by the world ' s richest man Bill Gates , who promised in 2008 that he would leave his $ 58 billion fortune to the charity started by him and his wife , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , and not to his children . \" We want to give it back to society in the way that it will have the most positive effect , \" he said . Of his plans for his children , Gates said : \" I will give the kids some money but not a meaningful percentage . . . they will need to work but they will feel reasonably taken care of . \"", "questions": "According to the survey , most rich Americans", "options": {"model": ["believe that their children would be able to earn money", "doubt their children ' s ability to handle wealth", "do n ' t think their children are rich enough", "do n ' t care about their children ' s future"], "human": ["think they owe their children nothing", "think it best to give their money back to society", "are confident of their children ' s ability to handle wealth", "doubt their children ' s ability to handle wealth"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
