{"id": "2026", "article": "Deaf teenagers Orlando Chavez and German Resendiz have been friends since kindergarten . Together the two boys , who go to Escondido High School in California , have had the difficult job of learning in schools where the majority of the students can speak and hear . Orlando lost his hearing at the age of one . German was born deaf , and his parents moved from Mexico to find a school where he could learn sign language . He met Orlando on their first day of kindergarten . \" We were in a special class with about 25 other deaf kids , \" German remembers . \" Before then , I did n ' t know I was deaf and that I was different . \" \" Being young and deaf in regular classes was very hard , \" signs Orlando . \" The other kids did n ' t understand us and we did n ' t understand them . But we ' ve all grown up together , and today , I ' m popular because I ' m deaf . Kids try hard to communicate with me . \" Some things are very difficult for the two boys . \" We ca n ' t talk on the phone , so if we need help , we ca n ' t call an emergency service , \" German signs . \" And we ca n ' t order food in a drive - thru . \" Despite their difficulties , the two boys have found work putting food in bags at a local supermarket . They got their jobs through a \" workability \" program , designed for teenagers from local schools with different types of learning disabilities . German has worked in the supermarket since August , and Orlando started in November . \" The other people who work here have been very nice to us , \" Orlando signs . \" They even sign sometimes . At first , we were nervous , but we ' ve learned a lot and we ' re getting better . \" The opportunity to earn money has been exciting , both boys said . After high school , they hope to attend the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in New York .", "questions": "Orlando and German have been", "options": {"model": ["schools where they can learn sign language", "friends when they were young .", "friends since they were very young ."], "human": ["deaf since they were born .", "to different high schools .", "friends since they were very young ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
