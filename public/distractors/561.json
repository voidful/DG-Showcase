{"id": "561", "article": "How Women Were Freed From Their Homes As late as 1800 , a woman ' s only place was in her home . Women in business were unheard of . No respectable woman would dream of entering what was strictly a \" man ' s world \" . Even if she would , what could she do ? Men were sure that no woman could do a job well outside her home . This was a widely - accepted idea . When the famous Bronte sisters began writing books in 1846 , they had to resort to using men ' s names as aliases . Teaching was the first profession opened to women , soon after 1800 . But even that was not easy for women to take because most high schools and colleges were open only to men . Oberlin College in Ohio was the first college in America to take in women . Nursing was regarded as a respectable profession for women only after Florence Nightingale won high credit for her nursing career and became famous . Miss Nightingale opened the first training school for nursing in 1860 in England . The invention of typewriters in 1867 helped to bring women out of their homes to join the business world . Because women are careful and have nimble fingers , businessmen found that they were well suited to this kind of work . By 1890 , tens of thousands of women were working in schools , hospitals , shops , offices , and factories both in England and the States . Some even managed to become doctors or lawyers . The idea of women working in business and other circles was accepted .", "questions": "Oberlin College was the first college in America", "options": {"model": ["where women could find a job", "where girls could get advanced education", "which women could find jobs", "where women could get further education"], "human": ["where teaching was a profession only open to women", "to train women to be teachers and nurses", "to accept women only as professors and students", "where girls could get advanced education"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
