{"id": "133", "article": "I am the captain of a ship in American Marine Police Force . I have been working as a policeman on the sea for eight years . I really love the sea because of its cool winds , the fresh smell and the beautiful scenery , so I joined Marine Police Force to safeguard the sea . Several days ago , I was out on a boat with my friends . We were not on duty but our officer allowed us to use the police sailing boat . It was very relaxing to have a day off on the sea with friends . We went fishing . We were on our way back when I saw a ship with the name PSS Pollu . It was pouring oil into the sea . I was very upset about this , so I managed to call the ship and shouted , \" Stop at once and follow us back to the shore ! \" But PSS Pollu tried to escape . We tried our best to follow her but the ship was too fast for us so we contacted the Police Force and asked for help . Two fast police boats were sent and soon caught up with PSS Pollu . The ship had no choice but to give in . Six policemen searched PSS Pollu and found that it was carrying illegal goods . The men on PSS Pollu were punished . I was rewarded for providing useful information while I was off duty . I felt proud and now I love my job even more .", "questions": "The writer tried to catch PSS Pollu because", "options": {"model": ["he did n ' t know the sea", "it was too fast for the police", "it polluted the sea"], "human": ["it hunted for sea animals", "it attacked the police boat", "it polluted the sea"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
