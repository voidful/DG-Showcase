{"id": "1636", "article": "In 1693 the philosopher John Locke warned that children should not be given too much \" unhealthy fruit \" to eat . Three centuries later , misguided ideas about child - raising are still popular . Many parents fear that their children will die unless ceaselessly watched . In America the law can be equally paranoid . In South Carolina this month Debra Harrell was jailed for letting her 9 - year - old daughter play in a park unsupervised . Her severe punishment reflects the rich world ' s worry about parenting . By most objective measures , modern parents are far more conscientious than previous generations . Dads are more hands - on than their fathers were , and working mothers spend more time nurturing their children than the housewives of the 1960s did . However , there are two problems in this picture , connected to class . One is at the lower end . Even if poor parents spend more time with their children than they once did , they spend less than rich parents do . America is a _ here : its government spends abundantly on school - age kids but much less than other rich countries on the first two or three years of life . If America did more to help poor parents with young children , it would have huge returns . The second one , occurs at the other end of the income scale , and may even apply to otherwise rational Economist readers : well - educated , rich parents try to do too much . Safety is part of it - - they fear that if they are not constantly watching their children may break their necks , which is the least rational . Despite the impression you get from watching crime dramas , children in rich countries are safe , so long as they look both ways before crossing the road . The other popular parental fear - - that your children might not get into an Ivy League college - - is more rational . Academic success matters more than ever before . But beyond a certain point , parenting makes less difference than many parents imagine . Studies in Minnesota and Sweden , for example , found that identical twins grew up equally intelligent whether they were raised together or apart", "questions": "Which of the following can we learn from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["poor parents spend less time with their children than they once did .", "it is not easy for children to get into an blue league college .", "it ' s not easy for children to get into an uncomfortable league college .", "although poor parents spend more time with their kids than they once did , they spend less than rich parents do ."], "human": ["Only warm , capable and middle - class people can adopt a child .", "When it comes to child - raising , Economist readers will become more rational .", "Children in rich countries are in greater danger due to the bad influence of crime dramas .", "Although poor parents spend more time with their kids than they once did , they spend less than rich parents do ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
