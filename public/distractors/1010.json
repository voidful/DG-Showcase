{"id": "1010", "article": "I came to live here where I am now between Wounded Knee Greek and Grass Greek . Others came too , and we made these little grey houses of logs that you see , and they are square . It is a bad way to live , for there can be no power in a square . You have noticed that everything an Indian does is in a circle , and that is because the Power of the World always works in circles , and everything tries to be round . In the old days when we were strong and happy people , all our power came to us from the respectful circle of the nation , and so long as the circle was unbroken , the people were getting rich . The flowering tree was the living center of the circle , and the circle of the four quarters nursed it . The east gave peace and light , the south gave warmth , the west gave rain , and the north with its cold and strong wind gave strength and continuous power . This knowledge came to us from the outer world with our brief . Everything the Power of the World does is done in a circle . The sky is round , and I have heard that the earth is round like a ball , and so are all the stars . Birds make their nests in circle , for theirs are the same as ours . The sun comes forth and goes down again in a circle . The moon does the same , and both are round . Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing , and always come back again to where they were . The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood , and so it is in everything where power moves . Our places were like the nests of birds , and these were always set in a circle , the nation ' s circle , a nest of many nests , where the Great Spirit meant for us to nurse our children . But the \" white people \" have put us in these square boxes . Our power is gone and we are dying , for the power is not in us any more . You can look at our boys and see how it is with us . Where we were living by the power of the circle in the way we should , boys were men at twelve or thirteen years of age . But now it takes them very much longer to grow up .", "questions": "Two things being compared in the passage are", "options": {"model": ["the indians ' power of the circle in the way we should", "the indians ' past and present living conditions"], "human": ["the Indians ' old and new power", "the Indians ' past and present living conditions"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
