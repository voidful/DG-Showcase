{"id": "5141", "article": "What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever ? Like discipline , responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it . Still , it ' s one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life . Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works . It ' s been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying \" It got lost \" to \" I lost it \" . Indeed , being accountable , understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity . That ' s why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character . Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable . Yes , responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening . It asks us to carry our own weight , prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions .

In fact , irresponsibility is a form of self - forced servitude to circumstances and to other people . George Bernard Shaw once said , \" People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are . I do n ' t believe in circumstances . The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want , and , if they ca n ' t find them , make them . \" \" Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will - - his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals , \" said Albert Schweitzer . The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility : Bernard L . Brown , Jr . , once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water , which spilled on the floor beside the patient ' s bed . The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed , so he asked a nurse to mop it up .
