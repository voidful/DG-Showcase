Students can collect coupons and exchange them for small gifts , such as books , magazines , mobile phone covers and hand warmers . \" It ' s been such a surprise , \" said Liang Zahaoyun , 19 , a student at the university in Shanghai . \" It has given us one more motivation to finish our food . \" The measure is part of a national \" eat - up \" campaign which is organized by students to deal with food waste on campuses . Why only on campuses , you might ask ? Because according to a report by Xinhna News Agency , students waste twice as much food as the national average . The campaign on campus food waste is receiving attention across the country . \" The aim of the campaign is not only to encourage students to finish their food . We hope it can also encourage students to choose a more environment - friendly and healthy lifestyle , \" said Tao Siliang , secretary of the Youth League Committee at Shanghai University . But some school food is poorly prepared , so students do not like to finish it all . Some schools have taken notice of this and they are taking measures to improve it . \" I ' m glad that we ' ve reduced food waste since the ' eat - up ' campaign began . But if we call on students to waste less food , we should also improve the service and food standard on campuses . \" said Tao .", "questions": "The best title for this passage may be", "options": {"model": ["food waste on campus", "\" eat - up \" campaign on campus", "students ' food waste"], "human": ["Enjoy Your Food !", "Reduce Waste on Campus", "\" Eat - up \" Campaign on Campus"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
