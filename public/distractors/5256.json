{"id": "5256", "article": "Dear Aunt Tara , I have a problem with my homework . We have to do it in a group . It has to be finished this Friday , but Gary , the boy in our group , has done nothing helpful . He just keeps _ . Every time we talk about the work with him , he always says , \" Do n ' t worry . I ' ll do it later . \" But he seldom does his job . And when he does , he does it the wrong way . Someone has to do it for him again . What ' s worse is when Ms . Lin asks about our group , Gary always tells her that we others do n ' t work hard enough . I ' m really mad at Gary about this . We ' re in the same group . Should n ' t we help each other to do a better job ? Kate Dear Kate , It is important for students to learn how to work together in a group . Maybe you should talk to Gary about the problem and tell him you all need his help . If he still does n ' t change , go talk to your teacher . I believe she can make Gary do his job .
