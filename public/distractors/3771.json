After its first man in space , China plans a space laboratory , a lunar orbiter to look for valuable elements and minerals , robot landings on the moon and then the human touchdown . The price of space exploration is enormous . Russia and the US , the only two countries to have achieved manned flight , are struggling to keep their new investment , the international space station . But China , which has a long tradition in physics , mathematics and engineering , finds its doctoral graduates welcomed in the US and Europe for decades . And it has been able to learn from 40 years of pioneering successes and mistakes by the USSR and the USA . Space flight is a gamble and the stakes are high . If successful , China could become a member of the world ' s most exclusive club , set up a second home on the moon and get a powerful hand at the strategic bargaining table . Two designers from the Shenzhou III project said that 12 astronauts now are undergoing intensive training . One more unmanned space flight is planned before the first manned launch . Experts say that the Shenzhou spacecraft already provides China with a space vehicle capable of mounting a lunar program . Chinese scientists have also predicted that Mars will be the next target after the moon .", "questions": "We can infer from this passage that", "options": {"model": ["chinese scientists are expected that mars will be the next destination after the moon", "china plans a space lab after its first man in space", "chinese scientists show great interest in exploring mars now", "china is expected to be the third country of the moon in 2010"], "human": ["China ' s robot landing in the moon has been successful", "the USSR and the USA do n ' t allow Chinese people to land on the moon", "it is impossible for the Chinese people to land on the moon", "Chinese scientists show great interest in exploring Mars now"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
