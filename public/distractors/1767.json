{"id": "1767", "article": "Swimming in the water of Hawaii ' s Big Island is a fun experience . But it can be more exciting if there are dolphins swimming around and jumping out of the sea too . For many people , it would be a wonderful dream to swim with these lovely animals ! However , this may not be good for dolphins . They may get hurt because of human interaction . Dolphins are active and usually look for food at night . In the day , they like to rest in shallow bays . Many people think the dolphins are awake during the day as they swim . But when they sleep they rest half of their brain and keep the other half awake to breathe , so they may be sleeping even when they ' re swimming in the water . From 2010 to 2013 , spinner dolphins of Hawaii ' s Big Island were exposed to human activities more than 82 percent of the time , according to Julian Tyne , a researcher at Australia ' s Murdoch University . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) says disturbing the animals in their near - shore habitat could force them to swim to less favorable places , putting them at risk of attack by sharks and other animals . Besides , when people are around , dolphins become more active . Thus , they ca n ' t get enough sleep . \" Disturbing their resting behaviors can actually affect their long term health and the health of the dolphin population , \" Ann Garrett of NOAA ' s National Marine Fisheries Service told the Associated Press . As a result , the NOAA wants to make rules to help protect the dolphins . For example , the agency may ban swimming with the Hawaii spinner dolphins . Or they may stop people from swimming in shallow bays when the dolphins are resting . Tour operators must also be taught to watch for signs to know when the dolphins are in their resting state .", "questions": "Which activity is against the rules ?", "options": {"model": ["swimming in a deep in the water of hawaii ' s big island .", "swimming with the hawaii spinner dolphins .", "playing with the hawaii liftner dolphins .", "playing games with the hawaii blowner dolphins ."], "human": ["Swimming in bays where the dolphins live .", "Making signs that show the dolphins ' resting state .", "Making signs that show where the dolphins are .", "Swimming with the Hawaii spinner dolphins ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
