{"id": "2983", "article": "For four lonely years , Evelyn Jones of Rockford , Illinois , lived friendless and forgotten in one room of a cheap hotel . \" I was n ' t sick , but I was acting sick , \" the 78 - year - old widow says , \" Every day was the same . I would just lie on my bed and maybe cook up some soup . \" Then , six months ago , she was invited to The Brighter Side - - Rockford ' s day care center for the elderly . Every weekday morning since then , she has left her home to meet nine other old people in a church for a rich program of charity work , trips , games , and - - most important of all - - friendly companionship . Just a few years ago , there were few choices for the elderly between a normal life in their own homes and being totally confined in nursing homes . Many of them were sent to rest homes long before they needed full - time care . Others like Mrs . Jones were left to take care of themselves . But in 1971 , the White House Conference on Aging called for the development of alternatives to care in nursing homes for old people , and since then , government - supported day - care programs like The Brighter Side have been developed in most big American cities . \" This represents a real alternative to the feared institution and makes old people believe they have not left the world of living \" , says Alice Brophy , 64 , director of New York City ' s Office for the Aging , \" They do well at the centers , and I hate it when people describe us as elderly playpens . \" New York ' s 138 centers encourage continuing contact for the aged with the community ' s life . The centers serve more than 15 , 000 members , and volunteer workers are always looking for new ones . If someone does n ' t show up at the center for several days in a row , a worker at the center calls to make sure all is well . And although participation in the center is free , those who want to can pay for their lunches . No normal studies have been made of these centers for the elderly , but government officials are enthusiastic . In the future , the Public Health Service will do a study to decide if the programs can receive federal Medic", "questions": "We can conclude from the statements of Alice Brophy that", "options": {"model": ["the day care center is free for the old .", "the old people do well at the day care centers .", "the old people do n ' t like to go to the hospital .", "the old live in the center for several days ."], "human": ["the centers are like elderly playpens .", "old people like nursing institutions .", "outside the Brighter side they do n ' t work for the old .", "the old people do well at the day care centers ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
