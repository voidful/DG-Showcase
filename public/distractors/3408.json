{"id": "3408", "article": "Internet users can give websites a thumbs up or thumbs down in less than the blink of an eye , according to a recent study by Canadian researchers . Specifically , a positive or negative decision is made within one - twentieth of a second - - less than half the time it takes to blink . It is also about the time for users to read just one word on the website . In the study at the Carleton University in Ottawa , websites were flashed up on a screen for participants to view for 50 milliseconds , and then rated by the viewer . Later when the pages were viewed again for longer periods of time , the viewers ' opinion were the same . The study was published in the March / April issue of the journal Behaviour & Information Technology . \" It really is just a physiological response . If the first impression is negative , you ' ll probably drive people off , \" said Dr . Gitte Lindgard , the leading researcher , \" So Web designers have to make sure they ' re not offending users visually . \" However , the results did not show how to win a positive reaction from users . \" When we looked at the websites that we tested , there is really nothing there that tells us what leads to dislike or to like , \" Dr . Lindgard said . Usually the appeal of a website is tied to color1 , movement and interactivity . And while further research may offer more clues , personal taste would always be a limiting factor , according to Lindgard . \" If the designs were _ to a set of principles , would n ' t we find an awful lot of similar houses , gardens , cars ? \" she said . \" We ' d have no variety . \"", "questions": "How long does it take have a blink of the eye ?", "options": {"model": ["about one - tenth of a second .", "about half a second .", "less than half of the time ."], "human": ["the time to read a word on the web .", "the time to put the thumbs up or down .", "about one - tenth of a second ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
