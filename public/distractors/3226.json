{"id": "3226", "article": "Food labels are such a mess that the government is redesigning them , as the ingredient lists are usually too confusing . As a result , a shopper could spend hours in a grocery store watching , calculating , and comparing , and still could not get it right . ShopWell is trying to help by allowing consumers to scan food labels and receive understandable and personalized information . Here ' s how it works . Register for ShopWell , and enter your age and gender . Add your goals ( General health ? Or are you trying to lose weight ? ) . Then , note what you want in your diet , such as protein or iron , and what you want to avoid ( added sugar , say ) . Add your allergies and things you can not accept , and start scanning . Then ShopWell will come up with a clearly personal result : green for a food that is good for you ; yellow for foods you can enjoy a little ; and red for foods you should avoid . The results are easily understandable and is clean because it ' s not mixed with ads . Instead , ShopWell makes money by selling data to supermarkets . Its database contains 350 , 000 products , the app has been downloaded 1 . 3 million times , and the company claims a scan every two seconds \" in stores such as Walmart , Whole Foods and 7 - Eleven , \" in the words of marketing manager James Allgood . One of the first items I scanned was So Delicious Coconut Milk Creamer , which I buy because I ' m lactose intolerant . It turns out it ' s only a little suitable for me - - because of its 1 gram per serving of added sugar . I ' m not sure I ' ll give it up . But Ididask the app to watch for added sugar , and it ' s doing its job . One _ to ShopWell is that the scanner often does n ' t work for items from Costco or Trader Joe ' s . Meanwhile , Some user reviews say that it does n ' t cover enough allergies .", "questions": "How can ShopWell make some profits ?", "options": {"model": ["by providing its collected data to supermarkets .", "by selling data to supermarkets ."], "human": ["By following the words of marketing manager James Allgood .", "By providing its collected data to supermarkets ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
