{"id": "5371", "article": "Australia has passed regulations that will enable more international students to further their education in the country . The new measures were released by the Australian Department of Tertiary Education , Skills , Jobs and Workplace Relations in September and will take effect in mid - 2012 . As a result , the student visa application process for overseas students has been simplified , and the deposit required to study in Australia has been reduced . Language requirements for overseas students have also been eased . Also , overseas students receiving a higher education in Australia will be granted a working visa lasting from two to four years after graduation , as long as they meet the basic IELTS requirement . \" This change will definitely make Australia a more attractive destination for Chinese students planning to study overseas , \" says Wang Lan , a consultant from Education International Cooperation Group ( EIC ) , a Beijing - based company that provides services to students wishing to study overseas . However , in the past few years , many of Wang ' s student clients could not start studies in Australia because they did not meet the language requirements , visa processing took a long time and deposit regulations were tough . The change in policy is good news for the parents of students wishing to study in Australia , Wang says . A 22 - year - old female student surnamed Li , in Beijing , who is planning to do her postgraduate studies in Australia , learned about the policy change several weeks ago . \" According to the previous deposit requirement for my student visa , my family was required to put down 550 , 000 yuan ( $ 86 , 850 ) . Now we only need to prepare 410 , 000 yuan . This is a relief for my parents , \" Li says . She also says that the two to four years working visa makes her feel much clearer about her study plans . \" I believe several years of working experience abroad will strengthen my competitiveness when I return to China , \" she says . Gaining a competitive advantage is the major reason for Chinese students to study abroad , according to the report by EIC .", "questions": "After the new regulations are passed ,", "options": {"model": ["more australian students will choose to study in australia", "more international students will enter australia", "more chinese students will choose to study abroad", "more chinese students will choose to further their education in australia"], "human": ["more students will come to Australia to work", "more Chinese students will choose to live in Australia .", "the opportunities to work in Australia decrease for overseas students", "more Chinese students will choose to further their education in Australia"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
