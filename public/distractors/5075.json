{"id": "5075", "article": "So many of us expect everything we do to be successful . We look forward to success to show us our value or to be the top of the group wherever we are . How many times in our schooling did we hope for a high mark ? We want it and then feel like a failure when we do n ' t achieve what we want . Even when we succeed we still pass that and go onto the next success and then the next . We are not often taught how to face failures . For me , failure taught me more than success did . Success is of the moment and temporary but failure means we have ever done . It makes me stop and think . It opened my eyes and brain to different possibilities . Failure is just a choice in redoing not in giving up . Experiencing failure , I looked deeper and further . I have a grandson who plays hockey and as all players do , he went through a _ . So I saw he was unhappy with himself . Then I said to him , \" Why do n ' t you think of it differently rather than being unhappy ? \" And I asked , \" Scoring is your goal , right ? \" He answered , \" Of course . \" \" Why are n ' t you scoring now ? Do you need a readjustment ? \" All of a sudden he calmed down - - he was thinking of what I had just said . So in the next game I saw him trying different things to do better . Later he started scoring . Now when something is wrong , he takes the time to think it over rather than just keeping the \" failure \" mode . Look at failure differently . Failure is what gives us power to try a different way of doing things . It teaches us to rethink , redo , and then success will come about . Do n ' t give up but learn to use a different way .", "questions": "Why did the author ' s grandson do better in playing hockey in the end ?", "options": {"model": ["he did n ' t think he could succeed at first .", "he thought and tried in a different way ."], "human": ["He did n ' t make a change and kept the \" failure \" mode .", "He thought and tried in a different way ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 1}}
