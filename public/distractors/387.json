{"id": "387", "article": "August was one of the nastiest months I can remember : torrential rain ; a hailstorm or two ; cold , bitter winds ; and mists . But we are accustomed to such weather in England . Lord Byron used to say that an English summer begins on July 31 and ends on Aug . 1 . He called 1816 \" the year without a summer . \" He spent it gazing across Lake Geneva , watching the storms , with 18 - year - old Mary Shelley . The lightening flickering across the lake inspired her Frankenstein , the tale of the man - made monster galvanized into life by electricity . This summer ' s atrocious weather tempted me to tease a Green whom I know . \" Well , what about your weather theory now ? \" ( One of the characteristics of Greens is that they know no history . ) He replied : \" Yes , this weather is unprecedented . England has never had such an August before . It ' s global warming , of course . \" That ' s the Greens ' stock response to anything weather - related . Too much sun ? \" Global warming . \" Too little sun ? \" Global warming . \" Drought ? \" Global warming . \" Floods ? \" Global warming . \" Freezing cold ? \" Global warming . \" I wish the great philosopher Sir Karl Popper were alive to _ the unscientific nature of global warming . He was a student when Albert Einstein ' s General Theory of Relativity was first published and then successfully tested . Einstein said that for his theory to be valid it would have to pass three tests . \" If , \" Einstein wrote to British scientist Sir Arthur Eddington , \" it were proved that this effect does not exist in nature , then the whole theory would have to be abandoned . \" The idea that human beings have changed and are changing the basic climate system of the Earth through their industrial activities and burning of fossil fuels - - the essence of the Greens ' theory of global warming - - has not much basis in science . Global warming , like Marxism , is a political theory of actions , demanding compliance with its rules . Those who buy in to global warming wish to drastically curb human economic and industrial activities , regardless of the consequences for people , especially the poor . If the theory ' s conclusions are accepted and agreed upon , the destructive results will be felt most severely in those states that adhere to", "questions": "Which of the following is probably a good title for this article ?", "options": {"model": ["global warming ? i see little point .", "concern about global warming ?"], "human": ["Why Einstein ' s Theory Stands the Tests .", "Global Warming ?
