{"id": "4948", "article": "Like most cultures around the world , the Zulu people of Africa tell stories that have animals as heroes . These stories are meant to have fun , but they are also used to teach important lessons to children . This is one of those stories . One hot afternoon , Jackal was walking along the rocky road sniffing the ground . He was hoping to smell a mouse or a lizard , or something else that would be good to eat . He was so much lost in sniffing that he was n ' t really paying attention to what was around himself . Suddenly , Jackal looked up to see his neighbor , Lion , walking straight toward him . He did not have enough time to run way . Jackal had played many tricks on Lion over the years , so he knew he would be in trouble if he was caught . Jackal needed to think of something quickly . \" Help ! Help ! \" cried Jackal as he quickly jumped upon a large rock hanging over the road . \" The rocks are falling down , and I ca n ' t hold them much longer . We shall both be crushed if you do not do your best to hold these rocks back , Lion \" At once , Lion pushed his strong shoulder against the rocks to keep them from moving any further . \" I ' ll just run over here to get something to stop the rocks . \" shouted Jackal as he ran way to safety . Lion stayed _ against the unmoving rocks for quite a long time before he realized that Jackal had tricked him yet again !", "questions": "Why was Jackal sniffing the ground ?", "options": {"model": ["to look for something to eat .", "to play tricks on lion .", "to keep the rocks from moving ."], "human": ["To play with Lion .", "To push a rock", "To look for something to eat ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
