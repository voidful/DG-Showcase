{"id": "1500", "article": "I stayed in bed for a few minutes . I was reluctant to leave its warmth and comfort , and reluctant to face the problem that I ' d let myself forget for the past six months . Finally , I dragged myself out of bed . I finished getting ready and tried to settle down . It did n ' t work , so I decided that my mum and I should go . We had a little time , so I thought we could practice parking . I failed , with the wheel hitting the pavement . After that , the little bit of confidence I ' d had was gone . I tried two more times , but did n ' t improve much . Then we headed to the test site . I went into a room for some paperwork . And I waited for 20 minutes - - just enough time to make myself believe that I was going to fail . Then , finally , it was my turn . I just wanted to get it over and make sure that I had to come back next Thursday . I stepped outside and the sky was the light blue I love . It offered me some comfort and I realized something : sometime between when I pulled myself off the seat and when I got outside , I had become calmer . The first thing I had to do was parking , which I did quite well . The confidence that came with it hit me like a wave . The rest of the test went well and I passed it all . As I drove back , the instructor told me I would not be coming back for a second test next Thursday . Back in the building I did n ' t have to say a word . My mum knew just by looking at me . Her smile made her face softer . And I ' m sure it was at least as big as mine . But , her eyes looked kind of teary , so , I knew she was happy for me .", "questions": "Which is TRUE according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["when he got out of bed , his job did n ' t change his job .", "as he did well at the beginning of the text , his confidence grew .", "when he went into a room , he went to the test site .", "his mum did n ' t have to talk to him ."], "human": ["He did n ' t doubt that he could pass the driving test .", "As soon as he got to the test site , he calmed down .", "He was happy that he had to come back next Thursday .", "As he did well at the beginning of the text , his confidence grew ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
