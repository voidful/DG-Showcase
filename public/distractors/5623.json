Citizens of New Castle simply refer to it as \" The Miracle \" . Joel Haler woke up in his dorm room at Hope College last October totally paralyzed from the waist down . Four hospitals later , the only way he could walk was through Robotic Walking Treatment . \" This past Tuesday , I was doing the Robotic walk and lasted ten minutes , \" Joel said . After that , he gave up . Joel wanted to accept the inevitable and cancelled his next Robotic Walking Treatment appointment . Then , the night before his cancelled appointment , he woke up to a terrible pain . An hour and a half later , the serious pain left him with an unusual feeling in his legs . \" As it continued to move up my legs , it became more and more painful and it took an hour and a half to reach my hips , \" Joel recalled . \" I stood up and walked into my parents ' room . ' Mom and dad , look ! ' , \" he said proudly . \" He said something and I was like , ' Joel ! Joel ! You ' re walking ! You ' re walking ! ' We jumped out of bed , cried and hugged , \" Joel ' s mom Karen remembered . \" I burst into tears . It ' s hard seeing your son not be able to walk , but he was standing there , walking , \" Joel ' s father Eric said , tearfully . It was Thursday , January 23 , when he could finally walk . That date made perfect sense to Joel . He had dreamt of a calendar that only said \" J 23 \" . He did n ' t know what to make of it until \" a little boy at church , four years old , came up to me and said , ' you will walk on a Thursday ' , \" Joel recalled .
