{"id": "1849", "article": "In the past , young people inprefix = st1 / Japanwere expected to take on responsibilities to support their parents and grandparents . Now they expect to be supported well into young adulthood . The \" New breed \" , born since the 1960s , have never known anything but richness . Youth are seen as resistant to entering society as mature adults , to becoming social citizens . Once the great objective of reconstruction after the Second World War was accomplished , a new generation lost the motivating power that had untied the nation together . Japan ' s birth rate has been falling rapidly , partly because of the recession , and the job and financial insecurity that it has caused . In 1999 , the figure was 1 . 38 children per woman , the lowest ever recorded . At the same time , youth crime , although still especially low by western standards , rose to its highest level since record - keeping began 32 years ago . Likewise , the percentage of students dropping out before graduating , at 2 . 5 % also very low by western standards , has been rising . Entrepreneurial ( ) role models are few and far between . Bill Gates is often mentioned , but a foreign model can only have so much influence . The problem is that Japanese culture discourages people from revealing details of personal life , including such ordeal as starting a company . In the past , successful companies such as Honda or Hitachiprovided role models of a sort . But today they have been faded by the downturn , and few others have risen to take their place . Young people also quite often feel isolated from their fathers , who worked too hard at their jobs to establish much of a relationship with their children . \" The one thing they ' re sure of is that they do n ' t want to be like their fathers . And the girls do n ' t want to be with boys who are like their fathers , so the boys are sure not to be , \" says Professor Morishma .", "questions": "Today , entrepreneurial models are rarely found in Japan", "options": {"model": ["because of the lack of personal life", "because japan ' s birth rate has been falling rapidly", "because of the discouragement of japanese culture"], "human": ["because of the worshipping of western models", "because the \" new breed \" do n ' t want to work hard", "because of the discouragement of Japanese culture"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
