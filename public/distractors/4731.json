{"id": "4731", "article": "Imagine a world where air pollution is no longer a problem . Clean air is all around us . People do n ' t have to worry about polluting the air every time they drive their cars . They no longer need to face the problem of not having enough fuel either . Although scientists have been trying for many years to develop a new kind of car that does not need gasoline , _ have been unsuccessful . Recently , however , car engineers have succeeded in creating a new kind of car that runs on gasoline and electricity . This is the famous \" hybrid car \" . This car gets its name from the fact that it has a gasoline engine and an electric motor inside . Hybrid cars do not pollute the environment as much as the cars that are commonly used today . They also cost drivers less money because they need less fuel than ordinary cars . Hybrid cars are becoming widely popular in the United States . They are soon expected to become widely used around the world . If scientists and engineers continue to work on car development , perhaps the world with clean air that we imagined earlier just might become real in the future .", "questions": "The best title for the passage would be", "options": {"model": ["the car of the future", "the car of the world"], "human": ["The Invention of the Car", "The Car of the Future"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
