Since the campaign started , people have had different ideas about it . Some people think it is good for students . They think the campaign can make students healthier . Some students have little exercise and the campaign can make them run . But some people do n ' t think so . They think some schools do n ' t have enough place for students to do running . If students have to run on the road , maybe it is not safe . They also think there are many ways to become healthier ; running is not the only way . So they think the campaign is not a right decision .", "questions": "Which is NOT right according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the campaign has started .", "the campaign started from april last year .", "students in primary schools have to run 1 km a day .", "when the campaign started , people ca n ' t think it is good for students ."], "human": ["The campaign asks Chinese students to do exercise .", "The campaign will set running records for each student", "The campaign cares about the health problem of Chinese students", "The campaign started from April last year ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
