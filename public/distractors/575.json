{"id": "575", "article": "Everyone gathered around and Paddy read out loud , slowly , his tone growing sadder and sadder . The little headline said : BOXER RECEIVES LIFF SENTENCE . Frank Cleary , aged 26 , professional boxer , was today found guilty of the murder of Albert Gumming , aged 32 , laborer , last July . The jury reached its decision after only ten minutes , recommending the most severe punishment to the court . It was , said the Judge , a simple case . Cumming and Cleary had quarreled violently at the Harbour Hotel on July 23rd and police saw Cleary kicking at the head of the unconscious Gumming . When arrested , Cleary was drunk but clear - thinking . Cleary was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour . Asked if he had anything to say , Cleary answered , \" Just do n ' t tell my mother . \" \" It happened over three years ago , \" Paddy said helplessly . No one answered him or moved , for no one knew what to do . \" Just do n ' t tell my mother , \" said Fee numbly . \" And no one did ! Oh , God ! My poor , poor Frank ! \" Paddy wiped the tears from his face and said . \" Fee , pack your things . We ' ll go to see him . \" _ \" I ca n ' t go , \" she said without a hint of pain , yet making everyone feel that the pain was there . \" It would kill him to see me . I know him so well - - his pride , his ambition . Let him bear the shame alone , it ' s what he wants . We ' ve got to help him keep his secret . What good will it do him to see us ? \" Paddy was still weeping , not for Frank , but for the life which had gone from Fee ' s face , for the dying in her eyes . Frank had always brought bitterness and misfortune , always stood between Fee and himself . He was the cause of her withdrawal from his heart and the hearts of his children . Every time it looked as if there might be happiness for Fee , Frank took it away . But Paddy ' s love for her was as deep and impossible to wipe out as hers was for", "questions": "Paddy cried because he thought", "options": {"model": ["thee had been killed", "thee had been killed by himself", "what had happened to frank was killing fee", "he could n ' t be punished by his mother"], "human": ["Frank did kill someone and deserved the punishment", "Frank should have told Fee what had happened", "Frank had always been a man of bad moral character", "what had happened to Frank was killing Fee"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
