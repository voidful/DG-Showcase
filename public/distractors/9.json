{"id": "9", "article": "One of the most difficult questions to answer is how much a job is worth . We naturally expect that a doctor ' s salary will be higher than a bus conductor ' s wages . But the question becomes much more difficult to answer when we compare a miner with an engineer , or an unskilled man working on an oil - rig with a teacher in a secondary school . What the doctor , the engineer and the teacher have in common is that they have devoted several years to studying in order to obtain the necessary qualifications for their professions . We feel instinctively that these skills and these years should be rewarded . At the same time we recognize that the work of the miner and the oil - rig laborer is both hard and dangerous , and that they must be highly paid for the risks they take . Another aspect we must take into consideration is how socially useful a man ' s work is . Most people would agree that looking after the sick or teaching children is more important than , say , selling second - hand cars . Yet it is almost certain that the used - car salesman earns more than the nurse and the schoolteacher . Indeed , this whole question of just rewards can be turned on its head . You can argue that a man who does a job which brings him personal satisfaction is already receiving part of his reward in the form of a so - called \" psychic wage \" , and that it is the man with the boring , repetitive job who needs more money to make up for the soul - destroying repetitiveness of his work . It is significant that the jobs like nursing and teaching continue to be poorly paid , while others , such as those in the world of sport or entertainment , carry financial rewards out of all proportion to their social worth . Although the amount of money that people earn is largely determined by market forces , this should not prevent us from seeking some way to decide what is the right pay for the job . A starting point would be to try to decide the ratio which ought to exist between the highest and the lowest paid . The picture is made more complicated by two factors : firstly by the welfare benefits which every citizen receives , and secondly by the taxation system which is often used as an instrument of social justice by taxing high incomes at a very high rate indeed . Most countries now regard a ratio of 7 : 1 as socially acceptable .
