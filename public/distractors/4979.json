{"id": "4979", "article": "There are many things we need to know that we do not learn at school . For example , if we want to use our money wisely , we need to shop carefully . We need to know how to compare the prices of things in different shops . We need to be able to compare the quality of different brands . We need to know how to make a choice when we shop . Knowing how to make such choices is a \" life skill \" , and we need these skills if we are to live useful and happy lives . Some of these choices are small . For example , will I take an apple for lunch or a pear ? Will I go to school by bus or on foot ? Will I wear the red T - shirt or the blue one to the movies ? Other choices are more important . For example , will I eat healthy food for lunch or will eat junk food because it is tastier ? Will I work hard in all my classes or will I only work hard in the classes I enjoy ? We make choices like this every day . We have to realize that the choices we make can affect the rest of our lives . Just as importantly , our choices can also affect other people . The next time you decide to waste time in class , play a joke on someone or talk loudly at the movies , think about this : who else does your choice affect ?", "questions": "The main idea of this passage is", "options": {"model": ["we need to know how to make a choice", "we need to make choices", "we need to learn how to make choices", "it ' s important to make the right choices"], "human": ["it ' s important to know how to compare prices", "it ' s important to know how to shop carefully", "we learn everything we need to know at school", "it ' s important to make the right choices"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
