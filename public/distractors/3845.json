But it really does n ' t have to be that way , \" said Anaclerio . Last summer , Anaclerio and her friend Jill Carlisle , a Northbrook mother of a 2 - year - old , founded a home party - planning business called \" A Party in a Basket . \" Their goal is to help parents and children share in the fun part of party planning , like choosing the subject or making a cake , while they take care of everything . Drawing on their experiences as mothers , they have created 10 ready - to - use , home party packages . Everything a family needs to plan a party , except the cake and ice cream , is delivered to the home in a large basket . \" Our parties are aimed for children 2 to 10 , \" Anaclerio said , \" and they ' re very interactive and creative in that they build a sense of drama based on a subject . For example , at the Soda Shoppe party the guests become waiters and waitresses and build wonderful ice cream creations . \" The standard $ 200 package for eight children includes a basket filled with invitations , gifts , games and prizes , paper goods , a party planner and the like .
