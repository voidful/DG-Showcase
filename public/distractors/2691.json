{"id": "2691", "article": "Everywhere man is altering the balance of nature . He is facilitating the spread of plants and animals into new regions , sometimes deliberately , sometimes unconsciously . He is covering huge areas with new kinds of plants , or with houses , factories , slag - heaps and other products of his civilization . He exterminates some species on a large scale , but favours the multiplication of others . In brief , he has done more in five thousand years to alter the biological aspect of the planet than has nature in five million . Many of these changes which he has brought about have had unforeseen consequences . Who would have thought that the throwing away of a piece of Canadian waterweed would have caused half the waterways of Britain to be blocked for a decade , or that the provision of pot cacti for lonely settlers ' wives would have led to Eastern Australian being overrun with forests of Prickly Pear ? Who would have prophesied that the cutting down of forests on the Adriatic coasts , or in parts of Central Africa , could have reduced the land to a semidesert , with the very soil washed away from the bare rock ? Who would have thought that improved communications would have changed history by the spreading of disease - sleeping sickness into East Africa , measles into Oceania , very possibly malaria into ancient Greece ? These are spectacular examples ; but examples on a smaller scale are everywhere to be found . We make a nature sanctuary for rare birds , prescribing absolute security for all species ; and we may find that some common and hardy kind of bird multiplies beyond measure and ousts the rare kinds in which we were particularly interested . We see , owing to some little change brought about by civilization , the starling spread over the English country - side in hordes . We improve the yielding capacities of our cattle ; and find that now they exhaust the pastures which sufficed for less exigent stock .", "questions": "What had a piece of Canadian waterweed cause ?", "options": {"model": ["the waterways of britain were destroyed by forest .", "half the waterways of britain blocked for a decade .", "a lot of people died from the waterways of britain ."], "human": ["Eastern Australian was overrun with forests .", "In parts of central Africa , the land reduced to a semidesert .", "Half the waterways of Britain blocked for a decade ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
