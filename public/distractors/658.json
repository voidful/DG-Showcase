Last week , a guy whom I had n ' t seen since my bachelor party five years ago sent me a friend request . I accepted and waited for \" Easy E \" to send me a greeting of some kind . He had sought me out , after all . I learned from his profile that he was in a relationship and had a son . However , I ' m pretty sure we wo n ' t ever write wall - to - wall , let alone e - mail each other . But he ' ll remain a friend of online until one of us makes a point of removing the other from his official list . My pool of friends consists of family members , college buddies , co - workers from past and present , and friends of friends . There are 35 in all . If I spent some time uploading old e - mail addresses , I ' m confident that I could increase my friend count actually .

You never have to feel guilty for breaking away . Every day , the masterminds of Web 2 . 0 find new ways of making human communication easier . _ . Some things should n ' t be simplified . When it comes to friendship , there can be no shortcuts .", "questions": "Which of the following statements is NOT true ?", "options": {"model": ["the author is too busy to make friends with his family members online .", "the author ' s family members prefer to post their e - mails on the internet .", "the author is too busy to make friends online .", "the author communicates with all the 35 friends by e - mails ."], "human": ["There are 35 people in the author ' s list of friends right now .", "The list of 35 friends does n ' t include the old e - mail addresses .", "It is not difficult for the author to increase his friend count .", "The author communicates with all the 35 friends by e - mails ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
