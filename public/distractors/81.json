{"id": "81", "article": "Some people seem easy to understand : their character appears obvious on first meeting . Appearances , however , can be deceptive . I shrug my shoulders when people tell me that their first impressions of a person are always right . For my own part I find that the longer I know people , the more they puzzle me . I read in this morning ' s paper that Edward Hyde Burton had died . He was a businessman and he had been in business in Japan for many years . Once he gave me a great surprise . Unless I had heard the story from his own lips , I ' d never have believed that he was capable of such an action . He was always neatly and quietly dressed in accordance with his age and position . He did n ' t talk much , but what he said was sensible . You could n ' t imagine he ' d possibly raise his voice in anger . Here was a man who attracted you because you felt in him a real love for his fellows . He ' d tell with point a good and spicy story , and in his youth he ' d been something of an athlete . He was a rich man and he ' d made every penny himself . I suppose one thing that made you like him was that he was so weak ; he aroused your instincts of protection . You felt he could n ' t bear to hurt a fly . One afternoon Burton told me a \" funny \" story in a quiet , dry humour : \" There was a namesake of mine , who was the best bridge player I ever met . He seemed to have a fantastic instinct about the cards . He won a good deal of my money by card - playing . \" \" One day he came to me when he lost all his fortune . He came to see me in my office and asked me for a job . I asked him how old he was . \" \" ' Thirty - five ' , he said . \" \" ' And what have you been doing ever since ? ' I asked him . \" \" ' Well , nothing very much . ' he said . \" \" ' I ' m afraid I ca n ' t do anything for you just yet ' I said . ' Come back and see me in another thirty - five years , and I ' ll see what I can do . ' \" \" He did n ' t move . He went rather pale . He hesitated for a moment and then he told me that he had had bad luck at cards", "questions": "We learned from the story that Edward Burton", "options": {"model": ["arranged the end of his namesake ' s life", "won a good deal of his"], "human": ["knew the young man would kill himself", "arranged the end of his namesake ' s life"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
