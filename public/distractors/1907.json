{"id": "1907", "article": "Age has its special advantages inprefix = st1 / America . And one of the more impressive of them is the senior citizen discount . Anyone who has reached a certain age - - in some cases as low as 55 - - is automatically entitled to plenty of price reductions at nearly every level of commercial life . Eligibility is determined not by one ' s need but by the date on one ' s birth certificate . Practically the discounts have become a routine part of many businesses - - as common as color1 televisions in motel rooms and free coffee on airliners . People with array hair often are given the discounts without even asking for them ; yet , millions of Americans above age 60 are healthy and solvent . Businesses that would never dare offer discounts to college students or anyone under 30 freely offer them to older Americans . The practice is acceptable because of the widespread belief that \" elderly \" and \" needy \" are synonymous . Perhaps that once was true , but today , to be sure , there is economic variety within the elderly , and most of them are n ' t poor . It is impossible to determine the effect of the discounts on individual companies . For many firms , they are a stimulus to income . But in other cases the discounts are given at the expense , directly or indirectly , of younger Americans . Moreover , they directly annoy some politicians and scholars who consider it a coming conflict between the generations . Generational tensions are being fueled by continuing debate over Social Security benefits , which mostly involves a transfer of resources from the young to the old . Employment is another point . Supported by laws and court decisions , more and more older Americans are refusing the retirement dinner in favor of staying on the job - - thereby lessening employment and promotion opportunities for younger workers . Far from a kind of charity they once were , senior citizen discounts have become a powerful economic privilege to a group with millions of members who do n ' t need them . It no longer makes sense to treat the elderly as a single group whose economic needs deserve priority over those of others . Senior citizen discounts only enrich the myth that older people ca n ' t take care of themselves and need special treatment ; and they threaten the creation of a new myth , that the elderly are ungrateful and taking for themselves at the expense", "questions": "What does the author think of the Social Security system ?", "options": {"model": ["it helps the elderly to be independent", "it benefits the old the young", "it benefits the old at the expense of the young"], "human": ["It encourages elderly people to retire in time", "It opens up broad career chances for young people", "It benefits the old at the expense of the young"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
