{"id": "1687", "article": "A major new development in system of work in Britain is taking place . Flexible working hours , or \" Flextime \" , are catching on fast , and trend is continuing . In 1973 , over 500 organizations had adopted the idea , and by 1974 , this number had risen to over 200 , 000 . Flexible working hours were invented in Germany in the late 1960 ' s , but reached Britain only in 1972 . The system allows workers to start and finish work whenever they want , with only two requirements . These are , firstly , that all workers must present for certain \" key \" times in the day , and secondly , that all workers must work an agreed total number of hours per week . The system had proved a total success wherever it has been tried . A survey of 700 workers on flexible hours showed three main advantages : a better balance between working and private life , avoidance of the need to travel during rush hours and the ability to finish a certain task before leaving . From the employer ' s point of view , the system tends to increase productivity , reduce labour turnover and give workers a greater sense of duty . At first , \" Flexible \" was mainly confined to white - collar workers , but it is now being applied to manual workers too .", "questions": "\" Key \" time is a period when", "options": {"model": ["all workers must be at work", "all the workers must work"], "human": ["rush hours are over", "all workers must be at work"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
