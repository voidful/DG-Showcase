{"id": "5247", "article": "Pulling luggage through the airport can be a pain , as any frequent traveler will tell you . A new suitcase called only \" Hop \" is looking to change all of that , though , using signals from your cell phone to go hands - free . According to Hop ' s official website , the suitcase uses threesensors to identify the Bluetoothsignal from your phone and pick you out of a crowd . Once it ' s done that , a microprocessor not only figures out Hop ' s position as it relates to your phone , but controls the twocaterpillar tracks in the bottom of the unit to get it moving . Hop follows behind the user at a constant distance , so you do n ' t have to worry about it \" stepping \" on your heels , so to speak . If it loses the signal it ' s following , your phone will vibrate , letting you know that your poor suitcase is lost and alone in a sea of strange people . We can see Hop in action in the video below , and we have to say that it looks like a great little device . There ' s just one problem : it looks as if you ' ll have to walk at a ly slow pace to keep the suitcase from losing the signal . Since a walk through an airport is rarely a leisurely experience , that could potentially cause troubles . Also , do n ' t expect TSA agents to just smile and wave as you walk through security with a remote - controlled suitcase tailing you . Still , the idea behind Hop is really cool , and we ' re willing to believe that there are some frequent flyers who would like to put down some money for it right this instant . However , this is just a model at the moment , so do n ' t expect it to be available for sale anytime soon ( if it ever is , for that matter ) . Would you purchase one of these if Hop ever became available commercially ?", "questions": "According to the article , Hop may run into trouble because", "options": {"model": ["you usually walk too fast for hop to follow", "you do n ' t have to worry about your phone ' s position", "you do n ' t have to worry about it"], "human": ["your cell phone fails to tell you Hop is lost", "TSA agents wo n ' t be patient enough", "you usually walk too fast for Hop to follow"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
