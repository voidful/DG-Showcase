{"id": "127", "article": "When I spent the summer with my grandmother , she always set me down to the general store with a list . Behind the counter was a lady like no one I ' d ever seen . \" Excuse me , \" I said . She looked up and said , \" I ' m Miss Bee . \" \" I need to get these . \" I said , holding up my list . \" So ? Go get them . \" Miss Bee pointed to a sign . \" There ' s no one here except you and me and I ' m not your servant , so get yourself a basket from that pile . \" I visited Miss Bee twice a week that summer . Sometimes she shortchanged me . Other times she overcharged . Going to the store was like going into battle . All summer long she found ways to trick me . No sooner had I learned how to pronounce \" bicarbonate of soda \" and memorized its location on the shelves than she made me hunt for it all over again . But by summer ' s end the shopping trip that had once taken me an hour was done in 15 minutes . The morning I was to return home , I stopped in to get some run . \" All right , little girl , \" she said . \" What did you learn this summer ? \" \" That you ' re a meanie ! \" I replied . Miss Bee just laughed and said , \" I know what you think of me . Well , I do n ' t care ! My job is to teach every child I meet life lessons . When you get older you ' ll be glad ! \" Glad I met Miss Bee ? Ha ! The idea was absurd . . . Until one day my daughter came to me with homework troubles . \" It ' s too hard , \" she said . \" Could you finish my math problems for me ? \" \" If I do it for you , how will you ever learn to do it yourself ? \" I said . Suddenly , I was back at that general store where I had learned the hard way to add up my bill by myself .
