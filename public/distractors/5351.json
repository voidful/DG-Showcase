{"id": "5351", "article": "One year our family decided to have a special celebration of Mother ' s Day , as a token of appreciations for all the sacrifices that Mother had made for us . After breakfast we had arranged , as a surprise , to hire a car and take her for a beautiful drive in the country . Mother was rarely able to have a treat like that , because she was busy in the house nearly all the time . But on the very morning of the day , we changed the plan a little , because it occurred to Father that it would be even better to take Mother fishing . As the car was hired and paid for , we might as well use it to drive up into the hills where the streams are . As Father said , if you just go driving without object , you have a sense of aimlessness , but if you are going to fish there is a definite purpose that heightens the enjoyment . So we all felt it would be nicer for Mother to have a definite purpose . Father had just got a fishing rod the day before , which he said mother could use if she wanted to . Only Mother said she would much rather watch him fish than try to fish herself .

Father said that he could just stay home and put in the time working in the garden . He said that there was a lot of rough dirty work that he could do , like digging a trench for the garbage , which would save hiring a man , and so he said that he ' d stay home ; he said that we were not to let the fact that he had not had a real holiday for three years stand in our way . He wanted us to go right ahead and not to mind him . But of course we all felt that it would never do to let Father stay home , especially as we knew he would make trouble if he did . The two girls , Anne and Mary , would have stayed and helped the maid get dinner , only it seemed such a pity , for the two girls were eager to show their new hats on a lovely day like this .
