{"id": "1414", "article": "If you do n ' t have a college degree , you ' re at greater risk of developing memory problems or even Alzheimer ' s . Education plays a key role in lifelong memory performance and risk for mental disorder , and it ' s well documented that those with a college degree possess a cognitive advantage over those less educated in middle and old age . Now , a large national study from Brandeis University published in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry shows that those with less schooling can significantly make up for poorer education by frequently engaging in mental exercises such as word games , puzzles , reading , and lectures . \" The lifelong benefits of higher education for memory in later life are quite impressive , but we do not clearly understand how and why these effects last so long , \" said lead author Margie Lachman , a psychologist . She suggested that higher education may encourage lifelong interest in cognitive efforts , while those with less education may not engage as frequently in mental exercises that help keep the memory agile . But education early in adulthood does not appear to be the only route to maintain your memory . The study found that intellectual activities undertaken regularly made a difference . \" Among individuals with low education , those who are engaged in reading , writing , attending lectures , doing word games or puzzles once a week or more had memory scores similar to people with more education , \" said Lachman . The study , called Midlife in the United States , assessed 3 , 343 men and women between the ages of 32 and 84 with an average age of 56 years . Almost 40 percent of the participants had at least a 4 - year college degree . The researchers evaluated how the participants performed in two cognitive areas , verbal memory and executive function - - - brain processes involved in planning , abstract thinking and cognitive flexibility . Participants were given a series of tests , including tests of verbal fluency , word recall , and backward counting . As expected , those with higher education said they engaged in cognitive activities more often and also did better on the memory tests , but some with lower education also did well , explained Lachman . \" The findings are promising because they suggest there may be ways to level the playing field for those with lower educational achievement , and protect", "questions": "Why are the findings of the Lachman ' s study promising ?", "options": {"model": ["the higher education will improve people ' s memory .", "preparations for the higher education may lead to poorer education .", "the lower educated may have the same opportunities to keep up memory .", "the higher education will lead to later life ."], "human": ["We may have ways to cure the people who have memory declines .", "Adopting a different lifestyle can control cognitive functioning .", "We can find out the possibility to have better memories .", "The lower educated may have the same opportunities to keep up memory ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
