{"id": "3809", "article": "Tuvalu is located in the South Pacific . It is tiny and has only nine islands with a population of just 11 , 000 . In 1999 , it was the third - poorest country in the world . The islanders earned just $ 1 , 000 each year . But then something unusual happened . Tuvalu received an internet domain name - - the letters \" tv \" . These letters were very interesting for many companies around the world . A communication company from California offered to buy the domain name \" tv \" for $ 40 m . For the Tuvalans this was a very large amount of money . The islanders became very rich . Because of global warming , and because the islands are only 3 m above sea level , Tuvalu will probably become the first country in the world that will disappear under the sea . You can already see signs of the rising sea on Tuvalu . Some beaches are disappearing and you can see tree roots by the ocean . Cyclones used to be very rare but they now appear a few times a year , and the rains that come with the cyclones cause flooding . Despite these problems , the Tuvalans had their new money . They could use it to buy themselves a future . Or at least they could use it to buy some time . Paul Lindsay , a documentary film - maker , took these questions with him all the way to Tuvalu , and came back with an incredible story . As the water rises , the Tuvalans are using the money to develop the land . They are building new houses , planning nightclubs , restaurants and hotels and new cars are driving around on new roads . The residents do not think this is strange : \" Just because we are sinking , it does n ' t mean we do n ' t want to raise our standards of living . \" Sam Teo , Tuvalu ' s minister for natural resources told Lindsay .", "questions": "Which of the following information about Tuvalu is WRONG ?", "options": {"model": ["the islanders become rich because of the rising sea in tuvalu .", "the average income of the tuvalans is $ 1000 in 1999 .", "tuvalu will be the largest country in the world that will disappear under the sea ."], "human": ["Tuvalu is only 3 m high above sea level .", "The Tuvalans received $ 40 million when they sold the domain name .", "The average income of the Tuvalans is $ 1000 in 1999 ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
