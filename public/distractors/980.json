{"id": "980", "article": "To understand how Americans think about things , it is necessary to understand \" the point \" . Americans mention it often : \" Let ' s get right to the point . \" They will say , \" My point is . . . \" \" What ' s the point of all this ? \" The \" point \" is the idea or piece of information that Americans suppose is , or should be , at the center of people ' s thinking , writings , and spoken comments . Speakers and writers are supposed to \" make their points clear \" , meaning that they are supposed to say or write clearly the idea or piece of information they wish to express . People from many other cultures have different ideas about the point . Africans traditionally tell stories that express the thoughts they have in mind , rather than stating the point clearly . Japanese traditionally speak indirectly , leaving the listener to figure out what the point is . Thus , while an American might say to a friend , \" I do n ' t think that coat goes very well with the rest of your _ , \" a Japanese might say , \" Maybe another coat would look even better than the one you have on . \" Americans value a person who \" gets right to the point \" . Japanese are likely to consider such a person insensitive if not rude . The Chinese and Japanese languages are characterized by vagueness and ambiguity . The precision and directness Americans associate with \" the point \" can not be achieved , at least not with any grace , in Chinese and Japanese . Speakers of those languages thus have to learn a new way of reasoning and expressing their ideas if they are going to communicate satisfactorily with Americans .", "questions": "Which of the following peoples will tell a story to express what they have in mind ?", "options": {"model": ["africans .", "people .", "chinese and japanese ."], "human": ["Americans .", "Japanese .", "Africans ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
