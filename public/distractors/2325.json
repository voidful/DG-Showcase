{"id": "2325", "article": "When a caterpillar feeds on a tomato leaf , the plant moves rapidly to meet with a defensive response , systematically releasing \" proteinase inhibitors \" - - proteins that interfere with the caterpillar ' s digestion - - throughout the plant , especially in the leaves . But how does the message get from the wounded leaf to the rest of the plant ? Most scientists believed the alarm was spread by chemical messengers until a team of researchers headed by David Weldon - - a biologist at the University of East Anglia in Norwich , England - - made a shocking discovery . An injured leaf , the researchers found , sends an electrical signal to warn neighboring leaves of upcoming danger . It ' s a \" terribly tiny current \" driven by an electrical potential difference of only 20 millvolts , says Weldon , who measured the voltage after electrodes were attached to the plant ' s surface . \" Right now , all we can say is that there is a correlation , \" Weldon notes . \" If you wound the plant , you ' ll see an electrical signal accompanied by a biochemical response . \" To learn more about the reaction , Weldon ' s team plans to insert electrodes within the pant tissue ( rather than on the surface ) to determine what ' s going on at the cellular level . The findings may help explain other mysteries surrounding plants . For example , many plants start to flower in springtime , as days grow longer , but plants sense the change in the day length through their leaves , while flowers begin to bloom at the buds . \" There must be a signal from the leaf to the growing points , \" Weldon says . \" So far , no one has come up with a convincing chemical mechanism . Maybe an electrical signal is involved . \"", "questions": "The researchers discovered that", "options": {"model": ["the wounded leaf raised danger signals by tiny currents", "the plant changes in the day time", "the plant changes in the day length through their leaves"], "human": ["the whole plant was aware of the risk through different signals", "proteinase inhibitors expanded the warning to the plant ' s surface", "the wounded leaf raised danger signals by tiny currents"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
