Although the common person will say \" thank you \" nearly 5 , 000 times a year , one in three are more likely to add a \" cheers \" or \" ta \" where it ' s needed to show they are fashionable . One in twenty now say \" nice one \" instead , while the younger are more likely to offer a \" cool \" than a \" thank you \" . \" Merci \" , \" fab \" and even \" gracias \" were also listed as common phrases to use , as \" much appreciated \" . One in twenty who took part in the survey of 2 , 000 people by the Food Network UK for Thank You Day , which is marked on November 24 , 2011 , said a formal \" thank you \" was now not often needed in everyday conversation . More than one in ten adults said they regularly wo n ' t say thank you if they are in a bad mood . Most people stated that saying thank you was something that their parents trained them . A huge 70 percent of those questioned will say thank you to a person ' s face without even meaning it , while one fifth avoid saying it when they know they should . It seems our friends and family get the stress of our bad manners . Half of them admit they ' re not good at thanking those closest to them . Many of them explain that they do n ' t say thank you because their family \" already know I ' m grateful \" . When spoken words wo n ' t do , it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people . One third will still send a handwritten thank - you note - - - but 45 percent admit it ' s been more than six months since they tried to send one . A quarter of British people say \" thank you \" with food , with 23 percent cooking a meal to show their appreciation to someone . Another 15 percent bake a cake . It follows that 85 percent of people will be angry because of not getting the gratitude they feel they should receive .", "questions": "Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["many people think it unnecessary to say thanks to their family members .", "most people think it necessary to say thank you to a person ' s face without any meaning .", "most british people say thank you to a person ' s face without meaning it .", "most people think it necessary to say thank you to a person ' s family ."], "human": ["Most people express their gratitude to others by buying food for them .", "About fifty percent of people try not to say thank you when they should .", "Most people may feel natural when they fail to receive others ' gratitude .", "Many people think it unnecessary to say thanks to their family members ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
