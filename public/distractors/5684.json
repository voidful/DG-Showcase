But what the kid said made Paul quite surprised . \" I wish , \" the boy went on , \" that I could be a brother like that . \" Paul looked at the boy in astonishment , and then impulsively he added , \" Would you like to take a ride in my automobile ? \" \" Oh , yes , I ' d love that . \" After a short ride , the boy turned and with his eyes shining , said , \" Mister , would you mind driving in front of my house ? \" Paul smiled a little . He thought he knew what the he wanted . He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile .

He was carrying his little crippled brother . He sat him down on the bottom step , then sort of squeezed up against him and pointed to the car . \" There _ is , Buddy , just like I told you upstairs . His brother gave it to him for Christmas and it did n ' t cost him a cent . And some day I ' m going to give you one just like it . . . then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that I ' ve been trying to tell you about . \" Paul got out and lifted the kid to the front seat of his car .
