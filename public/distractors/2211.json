As we were talking , she said , \" I just wish I had meaningful work . I do n ' t feel like I am making a difference . I am just wasting my life . \" This is the theme I hear most often from clients who have been in the workforce awhile . All of us want to feel like we are making a difference . We want to believe our work means something . The problem comes in defining \" meaningful work \" . What is it ? That answer is different for everyone . For some meaningful work might be helping others organize their office . For others it may mean making a million dollars . What really matters is how you see it . What is meaningful work to you ?
