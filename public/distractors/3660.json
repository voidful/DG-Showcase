{"id": "3660", "article": "The possibility that pleasant smells might reduce pain has recently been suggested by new research . In a scientific study , doctors asked 20 men and 20 women to keep their hands in very hot water for as long as possible while breathing in different smells . As people believe that strong smells can affect the senses , volunteers were asked not to eat or drink for eight hours before the experiment began . During the experiment , volunteers were asked to take in pleasant smells such as vanilla , and unpleasant smells such as durians . The volunteers kept their hands in the water until it became too hot for them . When they could not bear the pain any more , they took their hands out of the water . Scientists are interested in whether the senses or smell is related to pain and whether men and women have the same senses . Now , the study has proved that for women , pleasant smells reduce pain . For men , there is no change . Dr Finkelstein has been studying smells since 1999 . He says that scientists already have data from 40 volunteers . He adds that this year , scientists will test another 60 volunteers and will be in a better position to explain the results . One explanation is that women ' s sense of smell developed long ago , and is linked to recognizing the smell of babies . Scientists used to believe that mothers recognized their children by sight only . Now , they have started to believe that the sense of smell also helps , but why pleasant smells do not reduce pain in men is a question still to be answered by scientists .", "questions": "Now scientists believe that", "options": {"model": ["men and women have the same senses as women", "men and women have different senses", "smells are helpful for mothers to spot their children", "it ' s good for women to get used to smell their hands"], "human": ["mothers recognize their children only by sight", "men ' s sense of smell developed a long time ago", "strong smells have a great influence on people ' s senses", "smells are helpful for mothers to spot their children"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
