Dreams may work the same way for a messy brain , helping you learn by organizing memories and ideas . To test how much dreams can help learning , Robert Stickgold had some students play a shapefitting game called Tetris for a few hours and then go to sleep . Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes . Interestingly , the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most . Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills . As we dream , many important tasks are getting done . The brain decides what to keep and what to forget . It is connecting new experiences to older learning . In fact , the brain is learning all night long . Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night , emotions are in the driver ' s seat . People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward . Often the dream event changes somehow - - another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset . So if your best friend moves away , you might dream that you ' re the one who ' s moving . In fact , dreams have a proven power to improve mood , and people who dream about what ' s bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who do n ' t . Everybody dreams for a couple of hours every night - - in the course of your life , you ' ll spend about 25 years asleep and 6 years dreaming . There ' s probably no single answer to the question why we dream , but there does n ' t have to be . One dream might help you remember your math facts , while another might lead to a new invention , or give you a fun , crazy story to tell your friends . It ' s all in a night ' s work for our busy , mysterious brains .", "questions": "Robert Stickgold ' s test shows that", "options": {"model": ["dreams can help us improve our ability", "dreams can help improve skills", "dreams can help people learn"], "human": ["players stop learning in dreams", "tasks can only be settled through dreams", "dreams can help improve skills"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
