{"id": "1880", "article": "The girl was hanging by her hands from the railings of a balcony . The balcony was on the twelfth floor of the high - rise block next to his . His flat was on the ninth floor and he had to look up to see her . It was half - past six in the morning . He had been awakened by the sound of an aircraft flying dangerously low overhead , and had got out of bed to look . His sleepy eyes , moved from the blue sky which was empty of cloud , empty of anything but the bright disappearing arrow of the aircraft , and then rested on the hanging figure . He really thought he must be dreaming , for this sunrise time was the hour for dreams . Then , when he knew he was n ' t , he decided it must be a scene in a film . There were cameramen down there , a whole film unit , and all the correct safety precautions had been taken . Probably the girl was n ' t even a real girl , but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down . The car park , paved courts , grass spaces between the blocks , all were deserted . On the balcony rail one of the dummy ' s hands moved , desperately . He had to believe then what was obviously happening . The girl was trying to kill herself . She had lost her courage and now was trying to stay alive . All these thoughts and conclusions of his occupied about thirty seconds . Then he acted . He picked up the phone and dialed the emergency number for the police . The arrival of the police cars and the rescue of the girl became the focus of talk for the people of the two blocks . Someone found out that it was he who had called the police and he became an unwilling hero . He was a modest , quiet young man , and was in relief when the talk began to die away . Again he was able to enter and leave his flat without being pointed at as a kind of St George and sometimes even congratulated . About a fortnight after that morning , he was getting ready to go to the theatre , just putting on his overcoat , when the doorbell rang . He did n ' t recognize the girl who stood outside . He had never seen her face . She said , \" I ' m Lydia Simpson . You saved my life . I ' ve come to thank you . \"", "questions": "What did the man do first after he got up ?", "options": {"model": ["he went to see the noisy aircraft .", "he went to see the girl ' s face ."], "human": ["He called the police to save the girl .", "He went to see the noisy aircraft ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
