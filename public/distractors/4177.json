Their teachers , parents or classmates ca n ' t stop them because they smoke anywhere they ca n ' t be seen - - on the way to school , in the dormitory , or even in the washroom . And most of the students think that smoking is very cool . But I want to tell you my story and then you will see that it ' s wrong to smoke when you are very young . When I was a middle school student , my friends at school smoked and they asked me to have a try . So I started smoking when I was fourteen . Soon I could n ' t wait to smoke as soon as I was free . After a month I could n ' t stop smoking . But two years later , I felt what smoking was doing to me . I could n ' t run far , I coughed every morning , and I got very weak . So I wanted to stop smoking . It was n ' t easy , but now I have stopped it , and I feel better . If you smoke , you will get ill more easily , and perhaps you ca n ' t grow taller , because there is something bad in cigarettes and also you may get some bad behaviors and habits such as stealing , _ and having a fight with others . So you can see smoking is a bad habit . If you smoke , try to stop . Though it is n ' t easy , you must do it as soon as possible .", "questions": "The writer stopped smoking .
