He chatted with anyone who was interested in the clothes and soon we learnt that he was going to a kindergarten party . He had done a great job of putting together interesting costumes . I noticed that the little boy was paying mostly with change . It seemed that he had robbed his pig bank to do this shopping . However , the cashier told him he was short after counting all the money . The boy thought for a moment and said , \" Please keep the shirt and I will come back with more money . \" It was clear that he had already used all the money he had and he was $ 8 . 00 short . The lady in front of me said , \" Well , I could pay half of that . \" I told the boy that I could pay the other half . We dug into our handbags . However , both of us only had ten - dollar bills and we needed the cashier to get the change for us . Other shoppers began digging into their pockets to find some change . It was amazing and touching as all these strangers seemed to react with the same mind . All wanted to be of help . Within minutes the cashier said , \" I have too much money . \" The cashier did n ' t need our ten - dollar bills . Then the lady in front of me , who had been the first to offer help , said , \" Wait ! I did n ' t even get a chance to give anything ! \" I smiled at her and said , \" You did your share , because it was your idea and you started all this . \" The little boy smiled and thanked us . We wished him the best and he left . I was left with a good feeling . I had seen the love and goodness of others all around me . The woman in front of me smiled and said , \" It sure feels good to give , does n ' t it ? \" I smiled back and said , \" Yes ! \"", "questions": "Why did the writer and the woman both feel glad ?", "options": {"model": ["because the boy did n ' t like the lady .", "because all the shoppers around were willing to help the boy .", "because the cashier did n ' t pay the boy ' s money .", "because the cashier did n ' t pay any money ."], "human": ["Because the boy had saved some money .", "Because they both did n ' t need to give anything .", "Because the cashier did n ' t look down on the boy .", "Because all the shoppers around were willing to help the boy ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
