{"id": "1856", "article": "Today was a very big day for me and I had already ordered up a pile of books I needed in the University Library from home by about 10 : 15 . Off I went at 10 : 30 to the University Library , to get all those references . Only trouble was that when I arrived I discovered I had n ' t got my university card that would open the library ' s electronic entrance , and every other place I needed to access . I had had it in another library the night before ( which was where I strongly suspected it still was ) , but the immediate dilemma was this : should I ( Plan A ) try using the old university library card I had , which I had thought I had lost , and had been cancelled , but I thought there was a chance it would still work the University Library turnstile ? Or should I ( Plan B ) admit it and hope that I could blag my way in on the \" I ' ve been coming to this library for 40 years . . . \" line ? I went for Plan A . Two reasons really . I think I could probably blag ( or cry ) my way in , but I thought it might get the entry staff into trouble . They ' ve known me for ages , but rules are rules . Besides , I thought there was a good chance that my old card would still work the turnstile even if it had been cancelled . And if it did n ' t work , I could still try Plan B . The answer was my old card did still work . I looked up that tricky little article about the Middle East , then I went off to my own little Library , knocked on the window and got let in by a graduate student ( I am sure there are also rules about not letting professors in when they have n ' t got their card , even if desperate and crying ) . And there was good news . There under the pile of books I had been using the night before was the lost card .", "questions": "Who is likely to be the writer ?", "options": {"model": ["a student working in the library .", "a graduate student .", "a student who works in the university library .", "a professor working in the university ."], "human": ["a librarian working in the Library .", "a student studying in the university .", "one of the entry staff working in the Library .", "a professor working in the university ."]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
