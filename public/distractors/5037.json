{"id": "5037", "article": "Not long ago , the only time you could see a robot was when you were reading a novel or watching a movie such asStar Wars . Today , however , a lot of things in science stories have been science facts . Robots are starting to appear in our everyday lives . These robots have different sizes , shapes , and colors . But they all have the same type of man - made \" brain \" . Leading the robot revolution are industrial robots that work in factories . Industrial robots can do different kinds of jobs that are often boring and sometimes dangerous . Robots are also coming to American homes , though not as quickly as they are entering factories . These robots are n ' t as friendly and bright as those you saw in Star Wars . But , their makers say , today ' s home robots \" walk \" , sense objects in their way ( and sometimes knock into them ) , and even carry objects ( which they sometimes drop ) . Well , nobody is perfect . We may laugh at home robot today , but some day they may see and hear better than humans do . We humans can only see certain wavelengths of light , and hear certain sounds . That ' s because the abilities of our eyes and ears are limited . Robots , however , need not have the same limits as we have . Robot may also be equipped with devices that pick up information humans ca n ' t . To understand what their sensing devices pick up is a hard job . Remember , man - - made brains handle information , including all kinds of data , as zeroes and ones . Imagine the difficulty in trying to explain to a robot what a football looks like - - using only zeroes and ones .", "questions": "Robots may deal with information that humans ca n ' t .
