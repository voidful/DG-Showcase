{"id": "119", "article": "Brazil has become one of the developing world ' s great successes in reducing population growth - - but more by accident than design . While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates , Brazil has had better result without really trying , says George Martine at Harvard . Brazil ' s population growth rate has dropped from 2 . 99 % a year between 1951 and 1960 to 1 . 93 % a year between 1981 and 1990 , and Brazilian women now have only 2 . 7 children on average . Martine says this figure may have fallen still further since 1990 , an achievement that makes it the envy of many other Third World countries . Martine _ , among other things , soap operas and installment plans introduced in the 1970s . Both played an important , although indirect , role in lowering the birth rate . Brazil is one of the world ' s biggest producers of soap operas . Globo , Brazil ' s most popular television network , shows three hours of soaps six nights a week , while three others show at least one hour a night . Most soaps are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities . \" Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values - - not many children , different attitudes towards sex , women working , \" says Martine . \" They sent this message to all parts of Brazil and made people realise other patterns of family life and other values , which were put into a very attractive package . \" Meanwhile , the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers . \" This led to change in consumption patterns and consumption did not get along well with unlimited reproduction , \" says Martine .", "questions": "What is Martine ' s conclusion about Brazil ' s population growth ?", "options": {"model": ["the development of brazil ' s population growth is based on the high life in big cities .", "the desire for consumption helps to reduce birth rate .", "the development of brazil ' s population growth rate has increased .", "it ' s impossible to reduce birth rates ."], "human": ["The increase in birth rate will increase consumption .", "Consumption patterns and reproduction patterns are contradictory .", "A country ' s production is limited by its population growth .", "The desire for consumption helps to reduce birth rate ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
