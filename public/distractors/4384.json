{"id": "4384", "article": "I bought a jasmine plant for my office . When I bought it , I was told it would bloom and the sweet smell would fill my office . I had the plant for two months , and every day I looked at it , but there were n ' t any flowers or pleasant smell . I was not happy , so I gave the plant to my friend Linda . One day , another friend Mary called and invited me to her office . When I walked in , her jasmine flowers surprised me . I reached out to touch the flowers . Mary cut some and gave them to me . I could n ' t help smelling them . Surrounded by the sweet smell of only a handful of these flowers , I suddenly understood something . Mary bought her plant the same time I did . It took a year for her jasmine to bloom . I was so impatient for mine to bloom ; regretfully , I gave it away . In a way my life is like the jasmine plant . I need to be patient and let things happen . Last Sunday Linda told me that she was going abroad the next week . Before she left , she returned the plant to me . This time I am going to wait . I have learned that when we want something in our life , we have to be patient . I am slowly learning to have that patience to wait for my jasmine to bloom .", "questions": "What has the writer learned from her experience ?", "options": {"model": ["the jasmine plant needs to be patient .", "a jasmine plant needs to be treated .", "patience is needed in life ."], "human": ["Flowers can make life better .", "Jasmine can be a wonderful plant .", "Patience is needed in life ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
