On the first day of school , with permission of the school headmaster , she took all of the desks out of the classroom . The kids came into the first period . They walked in , and there were no desks . They looked around and said , \" Ms Cochran , where are our desks ? \" And she said , \" You ca n ' t have a desk until you tell me how you earn them . \" They thought , \" Well , maybe it ' s our grades . \" \" No , \" she said . \" Maybe it ' s our behavior . \" And she told them , \" No , it ' s not even your behavior . \" Second period , the same thing . Third period . . . By early afternoon television news reporters had gathered in Ms . Cochran ' s class to find out about this crazy teacher . The last period of the day , Martha Cochran gathered her class . They were at this time sitting on the ground floor around the sides of the room . \" Throughout the day no one has really understood how you earn the ordinary desks in this classroom . \" she said , \" Now I ' m going to tell you . \" Martha Cochran went to the door of the classroom and opened it , and as she did , twenty - seven adults , who were fathers or mothers of the kids , walked into that classroom , each one having a school desk . And they placed those school desks in rows . And when they finished placing those desks , those kids for the first time in their lives understood how they earned those desks . Martha said , \" You do n ' t have to earn those desks . They did it for you . They put them out there for you , but it ' s up to you to sit here responsibly to learn , to be good students and good citizens , because they paid a price for you to have that desk , and do n ' t ever forget it ! \"", "questions": "Which of the following is NOT TRUE according to the text ?", "options": {"model": ["kids did n ' t have to pay a price for the desk at that time .", "kids finally understood what their teacher meant by themselves .", "there were only desks in the classroom for the first time .", "there were only desks in the classroom for the first time in the year of the year ."], "human": ["The headmaster supported Ms .
