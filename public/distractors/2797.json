He comes home from work about 6 : 30 , and by the time he has finished with dinner it is after 8 : 00 . He steps outside in the summer to relax - - but it ' s already getting dark ! Not much time to enjoy the summer day . Now suppose you set the clock ahead one hour . This person still does everything at the same time - - but this time , when he steps out at 8 : 00 there ' s still plenty of light to enjoy . An hour of daylight has been \" saved \" for him ! Daylight saving time does n ' t , of course , add any hours to a day . This is impossible . All it does is to increase the number of useful hours of daylight during the seasons when the sun rises early . Daylight saving is most popular in cities . It allows the closing of offices , shops , and factories at the end of the working day while the sun is still high . Farmers , who do their work by sun time , usually do not observe daylight saving time . They can not work in the field before the morning dew has dried or after it appears in the evening . Did you know who first thought of daylight saving time ? It was Benjamin Franklin ! When he was living in France in the 18th century , he suggested the idea to the people in Paris . But it was not adopted then . Daylight saving laws were first passed during World WarI , when materials for making electricity was hard to find , and when it was necessary to save on _ light . With daylight saving , the bedtime of many people comes soon after it gets dark , while without it , if people stay up until the same hour they may have to use artificial light . Germany was the first country to adopt daylight saving time in 1915 . Then England used it in 1916 , and the United States adopted it in 1918 .", "questions": "What ' s the purpose of adopting daylight saving time ?", "options": {"model": ["to make better use of daylight in certain seasons .", "to make better use of natural light .", "to change the way of saving time ."], "human": ["To have one more hour to work .", "To have one more hour to rest .", "To make better use of daylight in certain seasons ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
