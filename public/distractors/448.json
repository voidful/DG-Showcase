{"id": "448", "article": "Thirteen , for me , was a challenging year . My parents divorced and I moved to a new town with my father , far from my old family and friends . I was terribly lonely and would cry myself to sleep each night . To ease my sadness , my father purchased an old horse for me at a local auction . I named him Cowboy . Cowboy was without a doubt the ugliest horse in the world . But I did n ' t care . I loved him beyond all reason . I joined a riding club and suffered rude comments and mean snickers about Cowboy ' s looks . I never let on about how I felt , but deep inside , my heart was breaking . The other members rode beautiful , registered horses . When Cowboy and I entered the events where the horse is judged on appearance , we were quickly _ . No amount of preparation and love would turn Cowboy into a beauty . My only chance to compete would be in the speed events . I chose the jumping race . One girl named Becky rode a big brown horse in the race events . She always won the blue ribbons . Needless to say , she did n ' t feel threatened when I competed against her at the next show . She did n ' t need to . I came in next to last . The stinging memory of Becky ' s smirks made me determined to beat her . For the whole next month I woke up early every day and rode Cowboy five miles to the arena . We practiced running and jumping for hours in the hot sun and then I would walk Cowboy home totally exhausted . All of our hard work did n ' t make me feel confident by the time the show came . I sat at the gate and sweated it out while I watched Becky and her horse charge through the course and finish in first place . My turn finally came . I put on my hat , rubbed Cowboy ' s neck and entered the arena . At the signal , we dashed toward the first fence , jumped it without trouble and raced on to the next one . Cowboy then flew over the second , third and fourth fences like a bird and I turned him toward the finish line . As we crossed the line the crowd was shocked into silence . Cowboy and I had beaten Becky and her fancy horse by two seconds ! I gained much more than a blue ribbon that day . At thirteen , I realized that no matter what the odds , I ' d always come out a winner if I wanted something badly enough", "questions": "When the final race finished , nobody cheered because", "options": {"model": ["the win was unexpected", "cowboy won the blue medal in the"], "human": ["the audience did n ' t like Cowboy", "the win was unexpected"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
