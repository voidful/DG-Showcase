{"id": "4257", "article": "Dear editor , My English teacher is very strict with us . Several days ago , when we were in class , Tom asked me a question . But my English teacher thought we were speaking in class . She asked us to stand at the back of the classroom for a few minutes . This made me unfair . After that , I feel nervous in her class , so I do n ' t like her class . However , I really want to learn English well . What should I do ? Yours , Mike Dear Mike , I am sorry you are having difficulty with your English class . Every teacher wants his or her students to study hard . So I think you should have a talk with your English teacher and tell her what you were doing with Tom that day . If she knows your worries , maybe she will help you with your English . And she will be pleased to hear you want to learn English well . Of course , you should know that what your teacher did was good for you . When you are not trying as hard as you can , she has to stop it and try to help you . Wish you have a better life !
