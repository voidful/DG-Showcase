She told him to hammer ( , ) one in the garden fence every time he lost his patience and fought with someone . The first day he hammered 27 nails . In the following weeks he learned how to control himself better and the number of nails hammered became smaller and smaller . He learned it was easier to control himself than to hammer nails . The day finally came when he did n ' t hammer any nails . He went to tell his mother about it . Then his mother told him to pull off a nail from the fence each time he did n ' t lose his patience . After some days he told his mother that all the nails had been pulled off , so she took him to the fence and said to him , \" You ' ve behaved well , but look at all the holes in the fence . The fence will never be again like it was before . When you fight with someone , you leave wounds in him like these . The trouble may be over , but the wounds will always be there . \" So , learn to control yourself before you hammer the nail in the fence . Try not to leave any holes in your past .", "questions": "The writer wants us to", "options": {"model": ["learn to control ourselves", "take care of our temper"], "human": ["know hammering nails is useful", "learn to control ourselves"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
