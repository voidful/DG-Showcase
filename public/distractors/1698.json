{"id": "1698", "article": "Life on earth depends on water , and there is no substitute for it . The current assumption is that our basic needs for water - - whether for drinking , agriculture , industry or the raising of fish - - will always have to be met . Given this premise , there are two basic routes we can go ; more equal access to water or better engineering solutions . Look at the engineering solutions first . A lot of my research concentrates on what happens to wetlands when you build dams in river basins , particularly in Africa . The ecology of such areas is almost entirely driven by the seasonal changes of the river - - the pulse of the water . And the fact is that if you build a dam , you generally spoil the downstream ecology . In the past , such problems have been hidden by a lack of information . But in the near future , governments will have no excuses for their ignorance . The engineers ' ability to control water flows has created new kinds of unpredictability , too . Dams in Africa have meant fewer fish , less grazing and less floodplain agriculture , none of which were expected . And there average economic life is assumed to be thirty years . Dams do n ' t exist forever , but what will replace them is not clear . The challenge for the future is to find new means of controlling water . Although GM technology will allow us to breed better dry - land crops , there is no market for companies to develop crops suitable for the micro - climates of the Sahel and elsewhere in Africa .
