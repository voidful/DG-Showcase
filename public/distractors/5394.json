The man came up and began saying something bad to Chajam , \" You are a drinker ! You are a thief ! You are an idiot ! \" Chajam did n ' t care . He just smiled and walked on . Another man dressed very well saw this . He did n ' t understand and asked Chajam , \" How can you bear such offences ? Do n ' t you feel hurt ? \" Chajam smiled again and said , \" Come with me . I ' ll show you something . \" The man followed Chajam to a dusty room . Chajam lighted the candles and began searching through a pile of old clothes . Then he found a completely worthless robe . He threw it to the man and said , \" Try it , it will suit you . \" The man took the robe and looked at it . It was so old that it even had some holes in it . \" What are these dirty rags for ? \" asked the man angrily . \" I am well dressed . You must be crazy ! \" He threw the robe back . \" You see , \" Chajam said , \" you did n ' t want to try on the rags . Similarly , I did not want to try those dirty words that man threw at me .
