{"id": "465", "article": "There is an interesting , but at the same time a sad phenomenon now : there is a rise in the number of singers and bands that have little to do with good music . Many singers or bands know little about what good music means . What is the cause of this rise ? Most of these singers have taken music as a \" job \" because it is a good source of making money . And if you have a good appearance and also expensive clothes to show off at your concerts or at different appearances in public , then your voice is not as important as it should be . The public will prefer to admire more the most interesting parts of your body , whether you are a girl or a boy . They will even forget about the fact that you are there to show your music skills , not your dancing , which is important too , but not at such a high level . Therefore , we can see many young girls on TV who look very good but who have nothing to do with music . They choose to wear very provocative clothes to catch attention , but when it comes to singing they are a complete mess and one does n ' t need to have an ear for music to notice their lack of talent . But anyway , they have concerts and they enjoy travelling from one place to another . It is the public ' s fault because they accept this and are pleased with this commercial music . People who enjoy this kind of music are generally young people while adults prefer listening to old good bands . However , the young generation should understand while appearance is important , it is less important than talent and a good voice . If somebody has a great voice and wants to become a singer , he should take some special courses in this area , because they will help them improve singing abilities .", "questions": "From the passage we can learn that", "options": {"model": ["a singer ' s talent and voice are the most important factors", "a singer ' s talent and voice have nothing to do with music", "young girls on tv are more interested in music"], "human": ["appearance is the most important thing in the world of music", "adults should help young people improve their abilities", "a singer ' s talent and voice are the most important factors"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
