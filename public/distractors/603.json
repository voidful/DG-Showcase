{"id": "603", "article": "Chinese and Western eating habits are different . In China , the dishes are placed on the table and everybody shares . It is always polite to let guests or elderly people at the table taste every dish first . But in the West , everyone has his or her own plate of food . Although there are no strict rules on how to set chopsticks and spoons , there are some things you should never do during a Chinese banquet . Firstly and most importantly , do n ' t put your chopsticks upright in the rice bowl . Instead , lay them on your dish . The reason for this is that when people die , family members give them a bowl full of rice with a pair of chopsticks sticking out upright in it . So if you stick your chopsticks in the rice bowl , it appears that you want someone at the table to die . Make sure the spout of the teapot is not facing anyone , as this is impolite . The spout should always be directed to where nobody is sitting , usually just outward from the table . Do n ' t tap on your bowl with your chopsticks . Beggars tap on their bowls , so this is not polite . Also , when the food is coming too slow in a restaurant , you should not tap on your bowl . If you are in someone ' s home , it is like the cook .", "questions": "What is the difference between Chinese and Western eating habits according to Paragraph 1 ?", "options": {"model": ["in the west people have their own plate of food .", "in the west , everyone has his own plate of food .", "in china people share the dishes , while in the west people eat separately ."], "human": ["In China people are very polite , while in the West people are not so .", "In China people use the chopsticks , while in the West people use the knife and fork .", "In China people share the dishes , while in the West people eat separately ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
