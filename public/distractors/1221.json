{"id": "1221", "article": "My parents are amazing . I had the most wonderful childhood , and it ' s not because I had everything I wanted or because I was a cool kid . I have learned a lot about parenting from what my parents did . Here are a few gems that I use now or plan to use in the future with my two boys . Here ' s how a conversation often went when I was a kid . Usually it was around 4 : 30 p . m . I said , \" I ' m hungry . Can I have a cookie ? \" My mom answered , \" No . Have a banana . \" \" I do n ' t want a banana . \" \" Then you ' re not hungry . \" Sometimes I was angry about it , but I knew that was good for me . Thanks mom for not letting me eat junk food . Now I agree with my mother and I have this same conversation with my three - year - old son . I hope it helps him form healthy diet habits . I know many of us heard this as children . \" If everyone jumped off a bridge , would you do it , too ? \" If our kids asked for something just because everyone else had it or was doing it , we often got this response . It was the perfect response , and we soon learned not to ask for things because everyone else had it , but because it was something we wanted . I will always be thankful that my parents let us try the things that interested us , not the things they wanted to push us into . This helped me try swimming , dance , and the piano before second grade . I found a love - - singing - - and kept up with that through my college years . It drives me crazy , as a mom and teacher , when I see kids who are pushed into their parents ' favorite activities , even when they do n ' t have a passion for them .", "questions": "Which of the following may be supported by the writer ?", "options": {"model": ["the children can try the things that interest them .", "the parents should let their kids try the things that interest them .", "the parents can help the children grow healthily ."], "human": ["The children must do what their parents want them to .", "The children can do anything that they want to .", "The children can try the things that interest them ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
