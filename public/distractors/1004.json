{"id": "1004", "article": "I turned 16 on Friday , but the Driver ' s License Office in my small hometown was only open on Tuesday , so I had to wait through that extremely long weekend and an endless Monday before going in for my examination . I came to the Driver ' s License Office half an hour earlier _ , pacing back and forth on the worn porch waiting for the office to open at eight . I reviewed the driver ' s manual for the hundredth time . I was ready . I knew the manual backward and forward ; I had made an \" A \" in my driver ' s training course , and I was a genius behind the wheel . Finally , the door opened and a weary - looking man in a brown uniform let me in . \" Let me guess . You want to take the driver ' s test . \" his voice was not enthusiastic . \" Yes ! \" I answered in excitement . \" Ok , fill this out , and if you pass we ' ll go for a drive . \" _ . A quick check showed that my paper was perfect . \" Let ' s get in the car . \" He tossed me a set of keys , and I slid behind the wheel . Everything was going smoothly as we pulled out of the empty parking lot . I signaled a right hand turn , and we were on a deserted street . This was going to be easy . \" Turn left and go up Young Blood Hill , \" he ordered . My hometown is in the mountains , and Young Blood Hill was almost vertical . As I eased up the steep hill and came to a stop at the top , I heard the car ' s engine die . My heart sank . I would have to start it again without rolling back down the hill . I swallowed hard and turned the key ; as I moved my foot from the brake , the car began to roll . I suppose I could have rolled all the way back to the bottom except for one thing . There was something behind me which stopped my roll with a rough shake and crash of glass - - a police car . The policeman wrote me a ticket as I looked over the damage , and the man from the Driver ' s License Office slid behind the wheel . I waited until we had parked before I asked how long a person had to wait before taking the test again .", "questions": "Why did n ' t the car roll back to the bottom ?", "options": {"model": ["it hit a police car .", "it got in the car ."], "human": ["The man from the Driver ' s License Office helped make it stop .", "It hit a police car ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
