{"id": "1107", "article": "Young children whose mothers talk with them more frequently and in more detail about people ' s thoughts and feelings tend to be better at taking another person ' s perspective than other children of the same age . That ' s what researchers from the University of Western Australia found in a new study published in the journal Child Development . \" Parents who frequently put themselves in someone else ' s shoes in conversations with their children make it more likely their children will be able to do the same , \" said lead author Brad Farrant . Researchers of the UWA ' s Telethon Institute for Child Health Research looked at the influence of how parents interact with their children to learn more about how people develop the ability to take another ' s perspective . The two - year study involved more than 120 Australian children aged between four and six , including children with typically developing language and others delayed in language acquisition . The children completed tasks which were designed to assess their language skills , ability to infer others ' beliefs and use these to predict others ' behavior , and their ability to shift flexibly between different perspectives . Among children with typically developing language , the researchers found that mothers who talked more often and in greater detail about people ' s thoughts and feelings - - commenting on how another person might react to a particular situation as well as their own feelings about the topic - - had children with better language skills and better perspective - taking skills . Children with delayed language acquisition were also delayed in their development of perspective - taking skills . This displays the role played by language as children develop the ability to take another ' s perspective . \" Solving the many challenges that the world faces today requires us all to get better at taking the perspective of other people , \" said Brad Farrant .", "questions": "Which have an effect on the development of children ' s perspective - taking skills ?", "options": {"model": ["language skills .", "language skills"], "human": ["Mother ' s perspectives .", "Language skills ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
