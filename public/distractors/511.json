{"id": "511", "article": "Will it matter if you do n ' t have your breakfast ? A short time ago , a test was given in the United States . People of different ages , from 12 to 83 , were asked to have a test . During the test , these people were given all kinds of breakfasts , and sometimes they got no breakfast at all . Scientists wanted to see how well their bodies worked when they had different kinds of breakfasts . The rules show that if a person eats a right breakfast , he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast . If a student has fruit , eggs , bread and milk before going to school , he or she will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class . The result is opposite to what some people think . Having no breakfast will not help them lose weight . This is because they are so hungry at noon that eat too much for lunch . They will gain weight instead of losing it . You will lose weight if you reduce your other meals .", "questions": "During the test , the people were given", "options": {"model": ["no breakfast", "different breakfast or sometimes none", "no breakfast or no breakfast", "little breakfast at all"], "human": ["no breakfast at all", "very rich breakfast", "little food for breakfast", "different breakfast or sometimes none"]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
