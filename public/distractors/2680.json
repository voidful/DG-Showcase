{"id": "2680", "article": "Scientists in Canada say big ocean fish have almost disappeared from the world since the start of industrial fishing in the nineteen - fifties . The scientists found that population of large fish like tuna ; swordfish and cod have dropped by ninety percent in the past fifty years . The study took ten years . The researchers gathered records from fishing businesses and governments around the world . The magazineNaturepublished the findings . The scientists say the common method called longline fishing is especially damaging to populations of large fish . This method involves many fishing lines connected to one boat . These wires can be close to one - hundred kilometers long . They hold thousands of sharp metal hooks to catch fish . Longline fishing is especially common in the Japanese fishing industry . Records showed that Japanese boats used to catch about ten fish for every one - hundred hooks . The study says longline fishing boats now might catch one fish per hundred hooks . The scientists say industrial fishing can destroy groups of fish much faster than in the past . The study suggests that whole populations can disappear almost completely from new fishing areas within ten to fifteen years . Ransom Myers of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia led the study with Boris Worm of Dalhousie and the University of Kiel in Germany . Mister Worm says the destruction could lead to a complete re - organization of ocean life systems . Mister Meyers says the decreased number of large fish is not the only worry . He says even populations that are able to reproduce do not get the chance to live long enough to grow as big as their ancestors . He says not only are there fewer big fish , they are smaller than those of the past . American government scientists say even with the best efforts to protect fish populations , decreases are to be expected .", "questions": "Which of the following shows the fact that the populations of large fish have dropped ?", "options": {"model": ["japanese boats could catch ten fish for only one hundred boats .", "japanese boats could catch about ten fish for every 100 hooks .", "the japanese fishing industry could n ' t catch any fish for every 200 pieces ."], "human": ["Longline boats now might catch fewer fish every one - hundred hooks .", "Fish even able to reproduce do n ' t have the chance to live longer .", "Japanese boats could catch about ten fish for every 100 hooks ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
