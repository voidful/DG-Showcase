{"id": "1960", "article": "Americans are less inclined to get married than at any time in US history , posing social and public - policy dilemmas and the threatening to dissolve the \" glue \" that connects fathers to their children , experts say . A report released by the US National Marriage Project found \" a rather weakening of the institution of marriage \" in America . The researchers said the prefix = st1 / USmarriage rate has never been lower , births to unmarried women have skyrocketed , the divorce rate remains high and Americans ' marriages are less happy than in the past . \" There is no known society that has got along without marriage and has done a decent job in rearing and sponsoring the next generation , \" said Barbara Dafoe Whitehead , US National Marriage Project co - director . The crumbling of the institution of marriage should not be viewed as a kind social trend with no costs to society at large , added the project ' s other co - director , David Popenoe . US government statistics cited in the Rutgers report detail a crisis in marriage whose origins can be traced back about 40 years . The report , citing census data , said the marriage rate has quickly reduced by a third since 1960 . It said there were about 73 marriages per 1 , 000 unmarried women aged 15 and up in 1960 . In 1996 , the last year for which such figures were available , the rate was about 49 per 1 , 000 . Popenoe said the USmarriage rate now has dropped below a previous historic low recorded at the turn of the century . He said several factors have something to do with the trend . One is that Americans are delaying marriage until they are older . In 1960 , the median age for first marriages was 20 for women and 23 for men . In 1997 , with many college - educated Americans delaying marriage until their 30s , the median age rose to 25 for women and 27 for men , the report said . \" The later the marriage , by and large , the lower the ( overall ) marriage rate in the long run . In other words , people delay too long and then they decide not to marry after a while , \" Pope", "questions": "Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["the first marriage rate in the us was about 50 % of the men .", "the marriage rate has n ' t increased since there were more women aged 15 and up in america .", "researchers have found out that divorce rate has skyrocketed lately .", "the first marriage rate in the us was about 50 % of the women in the us ' s men ."], "human": ["Experts fear that the low marriage rate will pose grave social problems .", "The current marriage rate is the lowest ever since the turn of the century .", "Experts believe that delay in marriage will more likely make a person dismiss the idea of getting married .", "Researchers have found out that divorce rate has skyrocketed lately ."]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 3}}
