{"id": "3144", "article": "Scientists and religious experts are debating the value of a small piece of papyrus that found its way to a researcher in the United States . The piece of paper raises an ages - old question about Jesus , whose life and teachings form the heart of Christianity . Could Jesus have been married ? Harvard Divinity School Professor Karen King recently explained the Coptic wording on the papyrus . She says the words mean that Jesus called Mary Magdalene , an early Christian , \" my wife . \" She says he did this while speaking to his disciples , or followers . \" I do n ' t think that this text is that significant . There are so many barriers for it to get over . You ' ve got to show that it ' s reliable , and there are real questions about whether that text is reliable . \" Professor Bock expresses other concerns about the papyrus . For example , he says , there is not enough writing on it to establish the real meaning of the words . He says the word \" wife \" may not mean \" wife \" in the traditional way . And , he says the papyrus is just one text showing that Jesus might have been married . \" And then you ' ve got the fact that this is one text out of many , many , many texts that do n ' t indicate that Jesus was married . And I think had Jesus been married , the early tradition about Jesus would have reflected that . \"", "questions": "The passage is mainly about", "options": {"model": ["what the papyrus said .", "whether jesus were married .", "how jesus got over his papyrus ."], "human": ["an ages - old question left by Jesus .", "some debates about Jesus .", "whether Jesus were married ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 2}}
