In one province of Canada where French is the common language , the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French . Today , Chinese has become the first inofficial language in Canada . Canada ' s climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe . In winter , temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada . In summer , the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly . The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China . It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south . Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year . As the cold northern climate , only one - fifth of the land is suitable for farming . As it is known to all , Canada has one - third of the world ' s supply of fresh water . It has many great lakes . There are five great lakes in the south . And there are many others , especially in the north . It is also rich in natural resources , such as coal , oil , natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy . People of northern Canada are called Inuit , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4 , 000 years ago . They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage . Now , they seldom move . There are about 2 , 500 Inuit in all . The government has started a new school project in which Inuit teach their own young children . So it is hoped that the way of Inuit life will be kept alive for more centuries .", "questions": "From the passage we can know", "options": {"model": ["it is very cold in the south and the south of canada in winter .", "canada has many different kinds of natural resources .", "people in canada speak both french and english .", "the weather in canada is like that in china"], "human": ["Canada lies in the south of America", "the weather in Canada is so cold the whole year as some people think", "the Canadians government pays little attention to Inuit ' s education .", "Canada has many different kinds of natural resources ."]}, "answer": {"model": 1, "human": 3}}
