In recent years , research in psychopharmacology has proved what many people have known over the centuries : a positive attitude is good for you , good for your health , good for your wealth , good for everything . Researchers found that a positive attitude produces a specific chemical reaction which makes people feel better , while negative thinking results in a decline of hormone and shuts down the immune system . This leads to illness and depression . Positive thoughts will make you feel better . Even if you must begin by literally forcing yourself to be positive ( faking it , so to speak ) , it will become contagious and the positive thoughts will generate nice little chemicals and good feelings which will reinforce the positive thoughts . For example , if you force yourself to smile or laugh , even when you do n ' t feel like smiling or laughing , if you keep at it for a few minutes , you will soon feel like it . Feelings can generate thoughts , but thoughts can also generate feelings . Control your thoughts and you can control your feelings . Positive thinking is important in all aspects of our lives . There is probably no single factor more important in determining your success in achieving your career objectives than your own attitude .
