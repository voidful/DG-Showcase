{"id": "1449", "article": "Olaf Stapledon wrote a book called First and Last Men , in which he looked millions of years ahead . He told of different men and of strange civilizations , broken up by long ' dark ages ' in between . In his view , what is called the present time is no more than a moment in human history and we are just the First Men . In 2 , 000 million years from now there will be the Eighteenth or Last Men . However , most of our ideas about the future are really very short - sighted . Perhaps we can see some possibilities for the next fifty years . But the next hundred ? The next thousand ? The next million ? That ' s much more difficult . When men and women lived by hunting 50 , 000 years ago , how could they even begin to picture modern life ? Yet to men of 50 , 000 years from now , we may seem as primitive in our ideas as the Stone - Age hunters do to us . Perhaps they will spend their days goallocking to make new spundles , or struggling with their ballalators through the cribe . These words , which I have just made up , have to stand for things and ideas that we simply ca n ' t think of . So why bother even to try imagining life far in the future ? Here are two reasons . First , unless we remember how short our own lives are compared with the whole human history , we are likely to think our own interests are much more important than they really are . If we make the earth a poor place to live on , because we are careless or greedy or quarrelsome , our grandchildren will not bother to think of excuses for us . Second , by trying to escape from present interests and imagine life far in the future , we may arrive at quite fresh ideas that we can use ourselves . For example , if we imagine that in the future men may give up farming , we can think of trying it now . So set your imagination free when you think about the future .", "questions": "Spundles and ballalators are used in the text to refer to", "options": {"model": ["unknown things in the future", "human activities in the future"], "human": ["ideas about modern life", "unknown things in the future"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
