{"id": "3618", "article": "When you buy cooking oil in the supermarket , you may notice that some brands are labeled as \" GM ( genetically modified ) - free \" . So , what is genetic modification ? Are GM foods safe ? These questions have been put back into the spotlight recently . On Nov 19 , the Food and Drug Administrati0n ( FDA ) in the US announced that it had approved the AquAdvantage salmon to go on the market , making it the first genetically modified animal to be approved as food anywhere in the world . GM foods are plants or animals that have been given a gene from another plant or animal to make them stronger in some way . The AquAdvantage salmon contains a gene from another type of salmon that makes it grow faster . Although the FDA has said \" food from the fish is safe to eat \" , some believe that scientists ca n ' t completely understand the potential health risks of GM foods , simply because they ' re so new . Others worry that the fish could escape into the wild and cause ecological problems . GM crops have experienced the same controversy , even though GM technology cuts down on the use of pesticides on crops and increases yields . While GM animals are new , GM crops have already appeared on our plates : A total of 28 countries in the world including the US , Brazil and India planted 181 . 5 million hectares ( 1 . 815 million km2 ) of GM crops in 2014 , according to the International Service for tile Acquisition of Agri - biotech Applications . In China , we grow GM cotton and papaya and import GM soybeans , corn , rape , cotton and beets from abroad . Due to safety worries , many countries have regulations for producing and selling GM food . In European Union countries , each GM food must be approved before it can be used . This process can take up to 17 months . The origin of all GM foods must also be traceable , and all food with a GM content of more than 0 . 9 percent must also be labeled , according to EU website europa . eu . The US is less strict about GM foods . According to FDA regulations , companies introducing new GM foods to the market should report them at least 120 days before release . The labeling is voluntary , except", "questions": "One of the reasons for many people to worry about the AquAdvantage salmon is that", "options": {"model": ["there are possible health risks that even scientists might not have figured out yet", "people do n ' t know how to grow gm food"], "human": ["the gene that makes them grow faster can work on humans too", "there are possible health risks that even scientists might not have figured out yet"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
