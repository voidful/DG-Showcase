{"id": "1918", "article": "Where do you find out about the world ' s longest walk ? The world ' s tallest man ? The world ' s oldest woman ? You know the answer , of course . It is the Guinness Book of World Records . How would people find such unusual facts without this book ? Guinness Book did not exist until 1951 . Here is what happened . The managing director of Guinness Brewery was a curious man . He wanted answers to some questions about records . For example , he wanted to know what was the fastest flying game bird in Europe . But he was frustrated . There was no book to answer questions like this . The director , Sir Hugh Beaver , contacted the McWhirter twins . They were brothers who owned a research agency . He asked them to put together a new reference book . It would include all kinds of unusual records . The brothers quickly accepted . The first edition of their book was published in 1955 . Soon the Guinness Book of World Records was a best seller . It has sold more copies than any book except the Bible . A new edition is published every year . Where do all the book ' s records come from ? They are a combination of things like natural wonders , sports records , and stunts ( How many people would push an egg with their noses if they were n ' t trying to get to the book ? ) . But the editors try to keep things honest . All records must be _ by an investigator . Only then are they printed . The Guinness Book is a big business . It is published in dozens of languages . There are TV shows and museums . It is proof of how interested people are in strange pieces of information .", "questions": "It is clear from the passage that the McWhirter twins", "options": {"model": ["has the guinness book of world records", "is not sure where to find out about the world ' s oldest woman", "recognizes that sir hugh ' s idea for a book was a good one"], "human": ["wanted to publish the book so that they set up a research agency", "wanted to know the answers to some questions about records", "recognizes that Sir Hugh ' s idea for a book was a good one"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
