The government must immediately bring the guilty to justice . A stricter government inspection system must be enforced to protect the workers . Nathan 2007 - 03 - 28 21 : 39 It is known that McDonald ' s and KFC and other fast - food restaurants pay the lowest wage they possibly can to get their employees . I think it ' s kind of funny that these two restaurants have not yet set up unions . It is also known that _ also take every possible measure e ( legal , and sometimes illegal ) to prevent their employees from forming or joining unions . I think it is high time that government enforced the law that they have made . Cushman 2007 - 03 - 28 22 : 32 The deepest reason is that China has a large population . If you complain that the pay is very low , the boss will tell you that can go to other places and that there are a lot of people waiting for the job . Today finding a job is not very easy , so you do n ' t have many choices , and you have to face the reality . Chip 2007 - 03 - 29 20 : 33 If wages were too low , people would n ' t work for them , but they do , so it proves the wages are reasonable . Sure , they could raise the wages , but why should they ? The workers are still working , still willing to show up on time , and it keeps costs lower . Were they to raise wages , they would have to FIRE more workers , and the price of burgers would go up . Then people would n ' t buy them , then McDonald ' s would once again FIRE more workers because of a reduced demand , and you ' d be back in the same boat , just with less people working .", "questions": "In the opinion of Cushman , the key to the problem is that", "options": {"model": ["china does n ' t have enough workers", "many workers are still working", "china has too large a population"], "human": ["the government has not taken stronger steps to protect workers", "the unions have not played an important part to raise the wages .", "China has too large a population"]}, "answer": {"model": 2, "human": 2}}
