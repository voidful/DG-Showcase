The trees in the school yard would be in full leaf again and the old leaves would be lying around like a muddy sea of leaves . \" Get that all swept up ! \" the headmaster would tell us . \" I want the whole place cleaned up , at once ! \" There was enough work there , to last over a week . Especially since the only tools with which we were provided were our hands , our fingers , and our nails . \" Now see that it ' s done properly , and be quick about it , \" the headmaster would say to the older pupils , \" or you ' ll have to answer for it ! \" So at an order from the older boys we would all line up like peanuts about to cut and gather in crops . If the work was not going as quickly as the headmaster expected , the big boys , instead of giving us a helping hand , used to find it simpler to beat us with branches pulled from the trees . In order to avoid these blows , we used to bribe the older boys with the juicy cakes we used to bring for our midday meals . And if we happened to have any money on us , the coins changed hands at once . If we did not do this , if we were afraid of going home with an empty stomach or an empty purse , the blows were redoubled . They hit us so violently and with such evil enjoyment that even a deaf and dumb person would have realized that we were being whipped not so much to make us work harder , but rather to beat us into a state of obedience in which we would be only too glad to give up our food and money . Occasionally one of us , worn out by such calculated cruelty , would have the courage to complain to the headmaster . He would of course be very angry , but the punishment he gave the older boys was always very small - - nothing compared to what they had done to us . And the fact is that however much we complained , our situation did not improve in the slightest . Perhaps we should have let our parents know what was going on , but somehow we never dreamed of doing so ; I do n ' t know whether it was loyalty or pride that kept us silent , but I can see now that", "questions": "The headmaster asked the older boys to", "options": {"model": ["take charge of the process of the cleaning up", "cut and gather in crops instead of giving them a helping hand", "cut and gather in crops"], "human": ["beat those who worked slowly", "treat the small boys as peanuts", "take charge of the process of the cleaning up"]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 2}}
