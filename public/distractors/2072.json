They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight . Bali was divided into seven small kingdoms . The land around each kingdom was kept empty , and no one lived there . Since the kingdoms did not share the same borders , the people could not fight about them . On Bali , even the young were not allowed to fight . If two children started a fight over a toy , someone stopped them . When two boys argued , they would agree not to speak to each other . Sometimes they did not talk to each other for months . This gave the boys a chance to forget their anger . Families who were angry with each other also promised not speak to one another . Their promise was written down , and the whole village knew about it . If they broke their promise , they had to offer presents to their gods .", "questions": "The text is written mainly to tell us that", "options": {"model": ["the people of bali were not satisfied with this island", "the people of the island fought for the long - term war", "the people of bali had no fight", "the people of bali were not allowed to fight"], "human": ["Bali was an island of quiet and beauty", "speaking after argument often leads to fight", "Bali was a safe place to have a holiday", "the people of Bali were not allowed to fight"]}, "answer": {"model": 3, "human": 3}}
