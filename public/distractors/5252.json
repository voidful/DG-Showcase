{"id": "5252", "article": "The sixth book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series by Jeff Kinney will be released November 15th , just in time for the Christmas shopping season . The book is titled Cabin Fever and will continue the funny story of middle school kid Greg Heffley . The story begins with Greg and his friend Rowley being accused of damaging school property . It was n ' t really their fault , but the authorities do n ' t see it that way . Just when they are about to get caught , the city gets hit by a giant blizzard . This is a good thing , right ? Well , _ Greg is now stuck at home with his family and all this gives him a bad case of cabin fever . Kinney says that the book is not only about the claustrophobia of being stuck at home for days without being able to leave , but also about getting stuck with an identity . Sometimes we get stuck a certain way when we are young and it ' s hard to change people ' s feelings of us . That ' s some pretty deep stuff , but we expect the book to mostly be full of silly and funny stuff that will make us laugh . The first printing of Cabin Fever will print 6 million copies of the book . Many kids who do n ' t like to read like the Wimpy Kid books because of the combination of cartoons , story , and comedy . Cabin Fever , like the other five , will have 224 pages of cartoons and funny events in the life of Greg Heffley as he sits out his holidays snowbound at home . They are generally recommended for kids 8 to 11 years of age , but older kids ( even adults ) may find them funny as they remember what it was like to be in middle school .", "questions": "What can we know about Cabin Fever ?", "options": {"model": ["it contains a lot of pictures and funny stuff .", "it is about getting stuck in a certain way when we are young ."], "human": ["It continues the story of a middle school student Rowley .", "It contains a lot of pictures and funny stuff ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 1}}
