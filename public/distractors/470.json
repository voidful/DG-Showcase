{"id": "470", "article": "Putting in water fountains at schools , and teaching children about the health benefits of water , could reduce their risk of getting extra pounds , reports a new study that is published in the latest issue of the journal Pediatrics . The findings are based on a survey in 32 elementary schools of two German cities , Dortmund and Essen . The researchers , led by Rebecca Muckelbauer , a nutritionist at the Research Institute of Child Nutrition Dortmund , weighed about 3 , 000 children , and asked them about their beverage consumption . At the beginning of the school year , the experts had water fountains added to 17 of the schools . The scientists also worked with teachers to carry out educational programs that promote the benefits of drinking water . In contrast to schools in the United States , there are very few schools in Germany that have water fountains . At the beginning of the study , there were no big differences in the number of overweight children in the different groups . But by the end of the school year , children in the schools with water fountains were 31 per cent less likely to gain extra pounds , compared to kids who went to other schools , where water drinking was not encouraged . Children in the schools with fountains increased their water consumption from about 3 up to 4 glasses a day , while those in the other schools continued to drink an average of 3 glasses . Over the research , the number of overweight kids upped from 384 to 385 out of 1 , 641 at the schools with water fountains . In comparison , the number of overweight kids at the other schools increased from 339 to 364 out of 1 , 309 , Dr . Muckelbauer said . The experts can not make any final conclusions and explain why the students who were encouraged to drink water were less likely to gain extra weight . Dr . Muckelbauer noted that according to a few other studies , drinking of water increases the rate at which calories are burned , while some other research suggested that water may temporarily decrease appetite .", "questions": "What do we know about the survey from the passage ?", "options": {"model": ["it lasted for a whole school year .", "it was carried out at the school year .", "the students were encouraged to drink water .", "the students who were encouraged to drink water were more likely to gain extra weight ."], "human": ["The teachers were also encouraged to drink water .", "The students surveyed were all overweight .", "It surveyed children in the countryside .", "It lasted for a whole school year ."]}, "answer": {"model": 0, "human": 3}}
